Rocks that formed in the crust are exposed when the rock and sediment that covers them is eroded away.
Volcanoes and Vents
The most obvious landforms created by lava are volcanoes.
These are mostly cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield volcanoes.
Eruptions also take place through other types of vents, commonly from fissures ( Figure below ).
The eruptions that created the entire ocean floor are essentially fissure eruptions.

When lava is thick, it flows slowly.
If thick lava makes it to the surface, it cannot flow far from the vent.
It often stays right in the middle of a crater at the top of a volcano.
Here the lava creates a large, round lava dome ( Figure below ).

Lava flows often make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of volcanoes ( Figure below ).
Lava domes forming in the crater of Mount St.
Helens
Lava domes may form in the crater of composite volcanoes, as at Mount St.
Helens.
A lava plateau is made of a large amount of fluid lava.
