For example, one atom of helium-4 has a mass of 4.0026 amu.
An atom of sulfur-32 has a mass of 31.972 amu.

The carbon-12 atom has six protons and six neutrons in its nucleus for a mass number of 12.
Since the nucleus accounts for nearly all of the mass of the atom, a single proton or single neutron has a mass of approximately 1 amu.
However, as seen by the helium and sulfur examples, the masses of individual atoms are not whole numbers.
This is because an atomâ€™s mass is affected very slightly by the interactions of the various particles within the nucleus, and the small mass of the electron is taken into account.
Carbon-12 is the reference for all atomic mass calculations.
An atomic mass unit is defined as a mass equal to one twelfth the mass of an atom of carbon-12.
The mass of an atom is affected by the interactions of particles within the nucleus.
