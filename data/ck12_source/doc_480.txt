In school, they use their eyes to read the board, their textbooks, and the expressions on their friends' faces.
After school, they might keep their eye on the ball while playing basketball ( Figure below ).
Then, they might read their homework assignment and text messages from their friends.
These basketball players use their eyes to keep track of the ball
All eyes are on the ball in this basketball game.
Think about how we use the sense of sight in other games.
Sight, or vision , is the ability to see light.
It depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images.
It also depends on the brain making sense of the images, so that we know what we are seeing.
Human beings and other primates depend on vision more than many other animals.
Itâ€™s not surprising, then, that we have a better sense of vision than many other animals.
Not only can we normally see both distant and close-up objects clearly, but we can also see in three dimensions and in color.
But humans do not have the best vision.
You may think you see things fairly clearly.
Imagine if you could see even better.
How about 8 times better?
Raptors, or birds of prey, including the eagles, hawks and falcons can see up to 8 times more clearly than the sharpest human eye.
A golden eagle for example can see a rabbit from a mile away.
Why do you think they have such a good sense of vision?
Other animals also have much better night vision then us.
