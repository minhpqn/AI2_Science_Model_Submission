Fatty acid (lipid) with double or triple bonds between carbon atoms; does not contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms.
Lipids are organic compounds that consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
They are made up of fatty acids and other compounds.
They provide cells with energy, store energy, and help form cell membranes.

Proteins - Advanced
Give examples of protein functions.
Identify the general structure of an amino acid.
Describe the four levels of protein structure.
You may have been told proteins are good for you.
Do these look good to you?
Proteins as food?
To you, these may not look appetizing (or they might), but they do provide a nice supply of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
Proteins have many important roles, from transporting, signaling, receiving, and catalyzing to storing, defending, and allowing for movement.
