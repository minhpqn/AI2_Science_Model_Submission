What are the pigments of xanthophylls and carotenids?
Describe electron carriers and the electron transport chain.
Name the two stages (sets of reactions) which make up the process of photosynthesis.
The Light Reactions - Advanced
Trace the flow of energy and materials through the Light Reactions, including chemiosmosis.
Oxygen has been described as a "waste product." How is this possible?
You could argue that oxygen is one of the most important, if not THE most important molecule necessary for life.
However, oxygen is essentially just a waste product of the light reactions of photosynthesis.
It is a "leftover" from a necessary part of the process.
All the oxygen that is necessary to maintain most forms of life just happens to be released from the plant during this process.
Photosynthesis Stage I:
The Light Reactions: in which Chloroplasts Capture Sunlight Chemical Energy…
Every second, the sun fuses over 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596 tons of helium, converting over 4 tons of helium (4.3 billion kg) into light and heat energy.
Countless tiny packets of that light energy travel 93 million miles (150 million km) through space, and about 1% of the light which reaches the Earth’s surface participates in photosynthesis.
Sunlight is the source of energy for photosynthesis, and the first set of reactions which begin the process requires light – thus the name, "Light Reactions", or Light-dependent Reactions.
This light is absorbed by chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in the plant cell.
The pigment molecule, chlorophyll, shown here, appears green because its electrons absorb blue-violet and red light and reflect green, orange, and yellow light.
This diagram shows that there are actually several different kinds of chlorophyll (a,b, and d shown here) in plants.
Each kind of pigment absorbs specific wavelengths (colors) of light (dashed lines).
Sunlight contains many different wavelengths, which you see when they separate into a rainbow.
