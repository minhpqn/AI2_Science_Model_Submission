Explain how oil spills can take place.

Can you see the oil in a big oil spill?
Of course.
The photo on the left shows the Gulf of Mexico oil spill after oil has leaked for nearly one month.
About a month later, about twice as much oil had spilled into the Gulf, as seen on the left.
The water moves and so the oil moves with it.
Oil spills are another source of ocean pollution.
To get at oil buried beneath the seafloor, oil rigs are built in the oceans.
These rigs pump oil from beneath the ocean floor.
Huge ocean tankers carry oil around the world.
If something goes wrong with a rig on a tanker, millions of barrels of oil may end up in the water.
