There are different types of freshwater biomes: ponds and lakes ( Figure below ), streams and rivers, and wetlands.
Ponds and lakes range in size from just a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers.
Streams and rivers are bodies of flowing water moving in one direction.
They can be found everywhere.
They get their starts at headwaters , which may be springs, melting snow, or even lakes, and then travel all the way to their mouths , emptying into another water channel or the ocean.
Wetlands are areas of standing water that support aquatic plants.
Wetlands include marshes, swamps, and bogs.

Aquatic Biomes and Sunlight
In large bodies of water, such as the ocean and lakes, the water can be divided into zones based on the amount of sunlight it receives:
The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters (656 feet) below the surface of the water.
This is where enough sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur.
Algae and other photosynthetic organisms can make food and support food webs.
The aphotic zone is water deeper than 200 meters.
This is where too little sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur.
As a result, producers must make "food" by chemosynthesis , or the food must drift down from the water above.
Aquatic Biomes and Dissolved Substances
Water in lakes and the ocean also varies in the amount of dissolved oxygen and nutrients it contains:
Water near the surface of lakes and the ocean usually has more dissolved oxygen than does deeper water.
