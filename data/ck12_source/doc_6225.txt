Ginkgoes , in the phylum Ginkgophyta , are unique because they are the only species left in the phylum.
Many other species in the fossil record have gone extinct ( Figure below ).
The ginkgo tree is sometimes called a "living fossil" because it is the last species from its phylum.
One reason the ginkgo tree may have survived is because it was often grown around Buddhist temples, especially in China.
The ginkgo tree is also a popular landscape tree today in American cities because it can live in polluted areas better than most plants.
Ginkgoes, like cycads, has separate female and male plants.
The male trees are usually preferred for landscaping because the seeds produced by the female plants smell terrible when they ripen.
Ginkgo trees are gymnosperms with broad leaves
Ginkgo trees are gymnosperms with broad leaves.
Gnetophytes , in the phylum Gnetophyta , are a very small and unusual group of plants.
Ephedra is an important member of this group, since this desert shrub produces the ephedrine used to treat asthma and other conditions.
Welwitschia produces extremely long leaves and is found in the deserts of southwestern Africa ( Figure below ).
Overall, there are about 70 different species in this diverse phylum.
One type of gnetophyte is ''Welwitschia''
One type of gnetophyte is Welwitschia .
Gymnosperms have seeds, but they do not produce fruit; the seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in cones.
