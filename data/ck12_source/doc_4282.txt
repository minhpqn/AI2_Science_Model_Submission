Sexual reproduction forms a zygote.
The zygote develops into a larva called a planula .
The planula, in turn, develops into a polyp.
There are many variations on the general life cycle.
Obviously, species that exist only as polyps or medusae have a life cycle without the other form.

General Cnidarian Life Cycle.
Cnidarians may reproduce both asexually and sexually.
Ecology of Cnidarians
Cnidarians can be found in almost all ocean habitats.
They may live in water that is shallow or deep, warm or cold.
A few species live in freshwater.
Some cnidarians live alone, while others live in colonies.
Corals form large colonies in shallow tropical water.
They are confined to shallow water because they have a mutualistic relationship with algae that live inside them.
The algae need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they must be relatively close to the surface of the water.
Corals exist only as polyps.
They catch plankton with their tentacles.
Many secrete a calcium carbonate exoskeleton.
Over time, this builds up to become a coral reef (see Figure below ).
