In the two images above, you can see Jupiter at two different times, showing moons in different places.
Earth orbits a star.
That star is our Sun.
One revolution around the Sun takes 365.24 days.
That is equal to one year.
Earth stays in orbit around the Sun because of the Sun's gravity ( Figure below ).
Earth's orbit is not a circle.
It is a bit elliptical.
So as we travel around the Sun, sometimes we are a little farther away from the Sun.
Sometimes we are closer to the Sun.
Students sometimes think the slightly oval shape of our orbit causes Earth's seasons.
That's not true!
The seasons are due to the tilt of Earthâ€™s axis, as discussed in the previous concept.
Planets in the solar system make elliptical orbits around the Sun
Earth and the other planets in the solar system make elliptical orbits around the Sun.
The ellipses in this image are highly exaggerated.
The distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers.
Earth revolves around the Sun at an average speed of about 27 kilometers (17 miles) per second.
Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun, so they take shorter times to make one orbit.
Mercury takes only about 88 Earth days to make one trip around the Sun.
