In fact, genetically speaking, we are all about 99.9% identical.
However, it is this 0.1% variation that results in our physical noticeable differences, as well as traumatic events such as illnesses or congenital deformities.
These differences can also be used for societies benefits, such as through forensic DNA analysis.
Most studies of this genetic variation focus on small differences, know as SNPs , or single nucleotide polymorphisms , which are substitutions in individual bases along a chromosome.
For example, the single base change from the sequence GGATAACGTCA to GGAAAACGTCA would be a SNP.
Although not occurring uniformly, in the human genome, it has been estimated that SNPs occur every 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 bases.
Additionally, small mitochondrial DNA is found in human mitochondria and contributes to the genome.
Human mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule, on average 16,569 nucleotides long and contains 37 genes. 100s to 1000s of these DNAs can be present in a single cell.
Due to the cytoplasmic location of the mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA is strictly inherited form the mother.
The structure of this DNA is similar to that of a bacteria, and is one piece of evidence supporting the Theory of Endosymbiosis.
gene :
A segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a single polypeptide.
genome :
The complete set of an organism's hereditary information; may be either DNA or, for many types of virus, RNA; includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA.
Human Genome Project :
A project to understand the genetic make-up of the human species by determining the DNA sequence of the human genome and the genome of a few model organisms.
microsatellite :
Short sequences of 100-200 bp, usually due to repeats of 1-6 bp sequences; also known as a STR (Short Tandem Repeat) polymorphism.
minisatellite :
A section of DNA that consists of a short series of repetitive elements of length 10-60 bp.
