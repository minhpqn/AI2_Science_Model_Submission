This separates light into different wavelengths, forming a rainbow of colors.
The wavelengths of visible light that an object reflects or transmits determine the color that the object appears to the human eye.
The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light.
These three colors are the primary colors of light.
All other colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors.
Secondary colors of light—cyan, yellow, and magenta—form when two primary colors combine equally.
Pigments are substances that color materials by reflecting light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths.
The primary pigment colors are cyan, yellow, and magenta.
They can be combined to produce all other colors.
