Introduction to Life Science
What does it mean to be alive?
Scientifically, there is an actual definition of living.
Living organisms must have certain characteristics.
If they do not have these characteristics, are they living?
This butterfly, like all other insects, animals, plants, and every other living organism, shares common characteristics with all life.
What exactly does it mean to be alive?
This chapter will answer this question.
These concepts will serve as an introduction to life science, discussing the basics of studying the life sciences and addressing the question, "What is a living organism?"
Scientific Ways of Thinking
Describe the role of a scientist.
Describe what is meant by "thinking like a scientist."
What was that noise?
If you let your emotions rule your thinking, you might think a thumping noise was a ghost.
If you think like a scientist, however, you ask questions and make observations.
You'd observe the shutters are loose and blowing in the wind.
Scientific Ways of Thinking
Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world, based on observable evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing.
That means scientists explain the world based on their own observations.
If they develop new ideas about the way the world works, they set up a way to test these new ideas.
