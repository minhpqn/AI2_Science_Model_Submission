It’s the only one that produces a right-side up image.
A lens is a transparent object, typically made of glass, with one or two curved surfaces.
A lens refracts light and forms an image.
A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle.
This causes rays of light to diverge.
The light forms a virtual image that is right-side up and smaller than the object.
A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges.
This causes rays of light to converge.
The light forms a real or virtual image depending on the distance of the object from the lens.
At the following URL, vary the location of the object in the animation and observe what happens to the image.
What can you infer from your observations?
What is a lens?
What does it do?
Describe the image formed by a concave lens.
Explain how a hand lens forms an enlarged image of an object.
Explain how optical instruments form images.
Describe how lasers and optical fibers work.
This colorful burst of “spaghetti” is really a bundle of optical fibers.
These are hair-thin threads of glass that transmit laser light that has been encoded with messages.
Optical fibers are a crucial component of modern communications.
