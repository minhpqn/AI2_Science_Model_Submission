Some people recover from spinal cord injuries.
But many people are paralyzed for life.
Thanks to the work of Christopher Reeve ( Figure below ), more research is being done on spinal cord injuries now than ever before.
For example, scientists are trying to discover ways to regrow damaged spinal cord neurons.
Former "man of steel" Christopher Reeve was paralyzed when he fell off a horse
Former "man of steel" Superman star Christopher Reeve (September 25, 1952 â€“ October 10, 2004) was paralyzed from the neck down in a fall from a horse.
The injury crushed his spinal cord so his brain could no longer communicate with his body.
If you suspect that someone has a back or neck injury:
don't move the injured person as permanent paralysis and other serious complications may result,
call 911 or your local emergency medical assistance number,
keep the person very still,
place heavy towels on both sides of the neck or hold the head and neck to prevent them from moving, until emergency care arrives,
provide basic first aid, such as stopping any bleeding and making the person comfortable, without moving the head or neck.
Mild brain injuries, such as a concussion, normally heal on their own, while serious brain injuries can cause permanent physical and mental disabilities.
Spinal cord injuries can lead to paralysis, when a person loses the ability to feel or move parts of the body.
