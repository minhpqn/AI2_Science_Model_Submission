The temperature at which a substance melts is called its melting point.
The melting point of ice is 0째C.
An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other substances.
The following Table below lists melting points of two metals and three alloys that they form together.
Examine the table and then answer the questions below.
Metal or Alloy
Melting Point (째C)
Iridium metal (pure)
Platinum metal (pure)
Platinum-iridium alloy (15% iridium)
Platinum-iridium alloy (10% iridium)
Platinum-iridium alloy (5% iridium)
Based on the information in the table, what conclusion might you draw about the melting points of alloys relative to the melting points of the metals they contain?
Bronze is another alloy.
It is a mixture that contains mainly copper with some added tin.
The melting point of copper is 1084째C, and the melting point of tin is 232째C.
What might be a reasonable prediction for the melting point of bronze?
What happens to particles of matter when it changes from a solid to a liquid?
What is the melting point of a substance?
What is the melting point of ice?
