You have a 5 \mu \mathrm{F} capacitor.
How much voltage would you have to apply to charge the capacitor with 200\;\mathrm{C} of charge?
Once you have finished, how much potential energy are you storing here?
If all this energy could be harnessed to lift 100 lbs. into the air, how high would you be lifted?
A certain capacitor can store 500\;\mathrm{J} of energy (by storing charge) if you apply a voltage of 15\;\mathrm{V} .
How many volts would you have to apply to store 1000\;\mathrm{J} of energy in the same capacitor? (Important: why isnâ€™t the answer to this just 30\;\mathrm{V} ?)
Marciel, a bicycling physicist, wishes to harvest some of the energy he puts into turning the pedals of his bike and store this energy in a capacitor.
Then, when he stops at a stop light, the charge from this capacitor can flow out and run his bicycle headlight.
He is able to generate 18\;\mathrm{V} of electric potential, on average, by pedaling (and using magnetic induction).
If Mars wants to provide 0.5 A of current for 60 seconds at a stop light, what should the capacitance of his capacitor be?

Capacitors in Series and Parallel
Apply the equations governing capacitors hooked up in series and parallel.
Students will understand and apply the equations governing capacitors hooked up in series and parallel.
C_{\text{parallel}} &= C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + \dots && \text{[5] Capacitors in parallel add like resistors in series}\\\frac{1}{C_{\text{series}}} &= \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3}+ \dots && \text{[6] Capacitors in series add like resistors in parallel}
