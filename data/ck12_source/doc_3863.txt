That chemical energy is then distributed to all other living organisms in the ecosystem.
Flow of Energy
To survive, ecosystems need a constant influx of energy.
Energy enters ecosystems in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds.
Some organisms use this energy to make food.
Other organisms get energy by eating the food.
Producers are organisms that produce food for themselves and other organisms.
They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds.
The stability of producers is vital to ecosystems because all organisms need organic molecules.
Producers are also called autotrophs .
There are two basic types of autotrophs: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs.
Photoautotrophs use energy from sunlight to make food by photosynthesis.
They include plants, algae, and certain bacteria (see Figure below ).
Chemoautotrophs use energy from chemical compounds to make food by chemosynthesis.
They include some bacteria and also archaea.
Archaea are microorganisms that resemble bacteria.
Photoautotrophs include plants, algae, and bacteria and can be found in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
Different types of photoautotrophs are important in different ecosystems.
Consumers are organisms that depend on other organisms for food.
They take in organic molecules by essentially “eating” other living things.
