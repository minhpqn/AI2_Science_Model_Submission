The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your cardiovascular system.
One measure of the health of your cardiovascular system is blood pressure.
Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels.
Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart, the walls of the arteries move in a rhythmic fashion.
Blood in arteries is under the greatest amount of pressure.
The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels.
Blood in veins is not under much pressure.
Healthy Blood Pressure Ranges
Blood pressure is read as two numbers.
The first number is the systolic pressure.
The systolic pressure is the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart beats.
This is the time when there is the highest pressure in the arteries.
The diastolic pressure, which is the second number, is when your blood pressure is lowest, when the heart is resting between beats.
Healthy ranges for blood pressure are:
Systolic: less than 120
Diastolic: less than 80
Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic.
For example, a reading of 120/80 is said as "one twenty over eighty." These measures of blood pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day.
Pressure varies with exercise, emotions, sleep, stress, nutrition, drugs, or disease.
Studies have shown that people whose systolic pressure is around 115, rather than 120, have fewer health problems.
