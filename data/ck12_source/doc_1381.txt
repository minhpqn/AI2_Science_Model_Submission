Mount Pinatubo, a large eruption in the Philippines in 1991, erupted only 25 km 3 of material.
Not surprisingly, supervolcanoes are the most dangerous type of volcano.
The exact cause of supervolcano eruptions is still debated.
However, scientists think that a very large magma chamber erupts entirely in one catastrophic explosion.
This creates a caldera into which the surface collapses ( Figure below ).
The composition of the eruption is felsic or highly felsic.

The largest supervolcano in North America is beneath Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
Much of the national park lies within the enormous Yellowstone Caldera.
It is so large that you can stand on one rim and not see the other side.

What would cause such a giant caldera?
Yellowstone sits above a hotspot that has erupted catastrophically three times: 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 640,000 years ago.
Yellowstone has produced many smaller (but still enormous) eruptions more recently ( Figure below ).
Fortunately, current activity at Yellowstone is limited to the regionâ€™s famous geysers.
No one knows when the supervolcano will erupt again.
