Volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries can be beautiful to look at.
They can also be beautiful to visit or even climb!
Convergent Plate Boundaries
Converging plates can be oceanic, continental, or one of each.
If at least one is oceanic, it will subduct.
A subducting plate creates volcanoes.
Many of the world's volcanoes are the result of subduction at a convergent plate boundary.
A map of the world's active volcanoes is pictured below ( Figure below ).

Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point.
Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1).
Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water.
As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material.
This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3).
When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it.
This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.
Convergent plate boundaries are found around much of the Pacific Ocean basin.
Trenches mark subduction zones.
Volcanoes are found in an arc above those subduction zones.
