The standard solution is the solution in a titration whose concentration is known.
In the titration described above the base solution is the standard solution.
It is very important in a titration to add the solution from the buret slowly so that the point at which the indicator changes color can be found accurately.
The end point of a titration is the point at which the indicator changes color.
When phenolphthalein is the indicator, the end point will be signified by a faint pink color.
Phenolphthalein turns pink in basic solutions
Phenolphthalein in basic solution.
Definitions are given for equivalence point, titration and indicator.
The process for carrying out a titration is described.
