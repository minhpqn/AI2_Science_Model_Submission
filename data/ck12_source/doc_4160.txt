They consist of long, narrow cells arranged end-to-end, forming tubes.
There are two different types of vascular tissues, called xylem and phloem.
Both are shown in Figure below .
Xylem is vascular tissue that transports water and dissolved minerals from roots to stems and leaves.
This type of tissue consists of dead cells that lack end walls between adjacent cells.
The side walls are thick and reinforced with lignin, which makes them stiff and water proof.
Phloem is vascular tissue that transports food (sugar dissolved in water) from photosynthetic cells to other parts of the plant for growth or storage.
This type of tissue consists of living cells that are separated by end walls with tiny perforations, or holes.
Xylem and Phloem components
Xylem and phloem are the two types of vascular tissues in vascular plants.
Evolution of Vascular Plants
The first vascular plants evolved about 420 million years ago.
They probably evolved from moss-like bryophyte ancestors, but they had a life cycle dominated by the diploid sporophyte generation.
As they continued to evolve, early vascular plants became more plant-like in other ways as well.
Vascular plants evolved true roots made of vascular tissues.
Compared with rhizoids, roots can absorb more water and minerals from the soil.
They also anchor plants securely in the ground, so plants can grow larger without toppling over.
Vascular plants evolved stems made of vascular tissues and lignin .
Because of lignin, stems are stiff, so plants can grow high above the ground where they can get more light and air.
Because of their vascular tissues, stems keep even tall plants supplied with water so they donâ€™t dry out in the air.
