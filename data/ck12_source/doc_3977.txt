Prokaryotes are tiny and sometimes bothersome, but they are the most numerous organisms on Earth.
Without them, the world would be a very different place.
Prokaryotes are the simplest organisms.
The first cells and organisms to evolve would be classified as prokaryotic.

Prokaryotes are currently placed in two domains.
A domain is the highest taxon , just above the kingdom .
The prokaryote domains are Bacteria and Archaea (see Figure below ).
The third domain is Eukarya .
It includes all eukaryotes.
Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells.
The three domains of life
The Three Domains of Life.
All living things are grouped in three domains.
The domains Bacteria and Archaea consist of prokaryotes.
The Eukarya domain consists of eukaryotes.
Itâ€™s not clear how the three domains are related.
Archaea were once thought to be offshoots of Bacteria that were adapted to extreme environments.
For their part, Bacteria were considered to be ancestors of Eukarya.
