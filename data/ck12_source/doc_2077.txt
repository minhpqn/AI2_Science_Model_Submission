Some renewable resources are too expensive to be widely used.
As the technology improves and more people use renewable energy, the prices will come down.
The cost of renewable resources will go down relative to fossil fuels as we use fossil fuels up.
In the long run renewable resources will need to make up a large amount of what we use.
Important Things to Consider About Energy Resources
Before we put effort into increasing the use of an energy source, we should consider two things.
Is there a practical way to turn the resource into useful form of energy?
For example, it is not practical if we don't get much more energy from burning a fuel than we put into making it.
For example, what if it took more energy to make solar panels than we could get from the solar panels once they were working?
Then solar energy would not be worth pursuing until better solar panels were developed.
What happens when we turn the resource into energy?
What happens when we use that resource?
Mining the resource may cause a lot of health problems or environmental damage.
Using the resource may create a large amount of pollution.
In this case, that fuel may also not be the best choice for an energy resource.

Unlocking the Grid
Today we rely on electricity more than ever, but the resources that currently supply our power are finite.
The race is on to harness more renewable resources, but getting all that clean energy from production sites to homes and businesses is proving to be a major challenge.
