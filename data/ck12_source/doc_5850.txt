Models of an MP3 player are like ions of transition metals
How is an mp3 player designed?
In describing many technological items, it's not enough to simply say what brand or model we have.
We talk about details such as how much horsepower is “under the hood” for a car or how fast the chip is for our computer.
Even a simple device like an mp3 player has more than one size.
We can get an 8 MB player, or a 16 MB player.
Designation of the item often is incomplete without other information as to its capabilities.
Transition metals have more than one possibility for ion formation.
In order to name these compounds correctly, we need to be able to indicate which ion is involved in any given compound.
