What a beautiful sunset!
You probably know that sunlight travels in waves through space from the sun to Earth.
But do you know what light really is?
Is it just energy, or is it something else?
In this article youâ€™ll find out that light may be more than it seems.
Electromagnetic radiation, commonly called light, is the transfer of energy by waves called electromagnetic waves.
These waves consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields.
Where does electromagnetic energy come from?
It is released when electrons return to lower energy levels in atoms.
Electromagnetic radiation behaves like continuous waves of energy most of the time.
Sometimes, however, electromagnetic radiation seems to behave like discrete, or separate, particles rather than waves.
So does electromagnetic radiation consist of waves or particles?
This question about the nature of electromagnetic radiation was debated by scientists for more than two centuries, starting in the 1600s.
