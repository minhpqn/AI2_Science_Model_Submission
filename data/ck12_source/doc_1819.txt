Pedocal soil forms where grasses and brush are common ( Figure below ).
The climate is drier, with less than 65 cm of rain per year.
With less rain, there is less chemical weathering, there is less organic material, and the soils are slightly less fertile.
Grassland soils are examples of pedocal soil
Grassland soils are less rich than soils in more humid regions.
A third important type of soil is laterite .
Laterite forms in tropical areas.
Temperatures are warm and rain falls every day ( Figure below ).
So much rain falls that chemical weathering is intense.
All soluble minerals are washed from the soil.
Plant nutrients get carried away.
There is practically no humus.
Laterite soils are often red in color from the iron oxides.
If laterites are exposed to the Sun, they bake as hard as a brick.
Laterite soils, which are found beneath rainforests, are not good for growing crops
Laterite soils, which are found beneath rainforests, are not good for growing crops.
Pedalfer is the soil common in deciduous forests.
Pedalfer is dark brown and fertile.
Pedocal is the soil common in grasslands.
The more arid climate increases calcium in the soil.
