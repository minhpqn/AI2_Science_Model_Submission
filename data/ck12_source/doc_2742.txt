The smallest hydrocarbon, methane (CH 4 ), contains just one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.
Larger hydrocarbons contain many more.
Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms can have different shapes.
Although they have the same chemical formula, with the same numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms, they form different compounds, called isomers .
Isomers are compounds whose properties are different because their atoms are bonded together in different arrangements.
Examples of Isomers
The smallest hydrocarbon that has isomers is butane, which has just four carbon atoms.
In the Figure below you can see structural formulas for normal butane (or n -butane) and its only isomer, named iso -butane.
Both molecules have four carbon atoms as well as ten hydrogen atoms (C 4 H 10 ), but the atoms are arranged differently in the two compounds.
In n -butane, all four carbon atoms are lined up in a straight chain.
In iso -butane, one of the carbon atoms branches off from the main chain.
You can see three-dimensional models of these two isomers at the URLs below.
Rotate the molecule models to get a better idea of their shapes.
Isomers of butane
The next smallest hydrocarbon is pentane, which has five carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms (C 5 H 12 ).
Pentane has three isomers: n -pentane, iso -pentane, and neo -pentane.
Their structural formulas are shown in the images below.
Look at the carbon atoms in each isomer.
In n -pentane (see Figure below ), the carbon atoms form a straight chain.
In iso -pentane (see Figure below ), one carbon atom branches off from the main chain.
