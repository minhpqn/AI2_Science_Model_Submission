Distinguish between plankton, nekton, and benthos.
Define phytoplankton and zooplankton.
What is this?
Plant or animal?
It is actually the Yellow Christmas tree worm.
These animals are colorful, and can be red, orange, yellow, blue, and white.
The Christmas tree worm lives on tropical coral reefs throughout the world.
The Christmas tree worm's plumes are used for feeding and respiration.
These worms use their plumes to catch plankton and other small particles passing in the water.
Cilia then pass the food to the worm's mouth.
Aquatic organisms generally fall into three broad groups: plankton, nekton, and benthos.
They vary in how they move and where they live.
Plankton are tiny aquatic organisms that cannot move on their own.
They live in the photic zone.
They include phytoplankton and zooplankton.
Phytoplankton are bacteria and algae that use sunlight to make food.
Zooplankton are tiny animals that feed on phytoplankton.
See NASA - In The Zone at for additional information about phytoplankton.
Nekton are aquatic animals that can move on their own by “swimming” through the water.
They may live in the photic or aphotic zone.
