Neurons are a little like relay runners.
Instead of a baton, they pass neurotransmitters to the next neuron.
Examples of neurotransmitters are chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline.

Some people have low levels of the neurotransmitter called serotonin in their brain.
Scientists think that this is one cause of depression.
Medications called antidepressants help bring serotonin levels back to normal.
For many people with depression, antidepressants control the symptoms of their depression and help them lead happy, productive lives.
Neurons, or nerve cells that carry nerve impulses, are made up of the cell body, the axon, and several dendrites.
Signals move across the synapse, the place where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another, using chemicals called neurotransmitters.
