This signal is the 5’ cap .
The 5' cap is a modified guanine nucleotide ( a 7-methylguanosine) added to the 5’-end of the pre-mRNA soon after the start of transcription.
This 5’ cap is crucial for recognition and proper attachment of the mRNA to the ribosome, as well as protection from exonucleases, enzymes that degrade nucleic acids.
Specifically the 5' cap adds stability from RNases.
The process of 5' capping is vital to creating mature messenger RNA prior to translation.
The cap is also known as a 7-methylguanosine cap, abbreviated m 7 G.
5' (7-methylguanosine) cap structure.
In certain instances, the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA will be changed to allow the mRNA to produce multiple proteins.
This process is called editing .
The classic example is editing of the apolipoprotein B (APOB) mRNA in humans.
APOB is a protein that is responsible for carrying cholesterol to tissues.
It is the primary lipoprotein of LDL (low density lipoprotein).
The APOB protein occurs in the plasma in two main forms, APOB48 and APOB100.
APOB48 has 48% of the molecular weight has APOB100.
The first is synthesized exclusively by the small intestine, the second by the liver.
Both proteins are coded for by the same gene, which is transcribed into a single pre-mRNA.
Editing changes a C to a U in the mRNA, changing a CAA codon (Glutamine) to a UAA codon, which is a premature (early) stop codon.
Hence, upon translation this base change results in a smaller protein.
As a result of the RNA editing, APOB48 and APOB100 share a common N-terminal sequence, but APOB48 lacks APOB100's C-terminal region.
APOB48 contains only the first 2152 amino acids of the full-length 4536 amino acid APOB100.
