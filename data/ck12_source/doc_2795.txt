A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which the substances are mixed evenly throughout.
The substance that dissolves in a solution is the solute.
In this case the solute is sugar.
The substance that does the dissolving—in this case, the water—is the solvent.
Sugar is one of the most soluble solutes in water.
This means that more of it can dissolve in water than is true of many other solutes.
However, there is a limit on how much of any solute—even sugar—will dissolve in water or other given solvent.
Saturated vs.
Unsaturated Solutions
The maximum amount of sugar that will dissolve in a liter of 20 °C water is 2000 grams.
A sugar-water solution that contains 1 liter of water and 2000 grams of sugar is said to be saturated.
A saturated solution is a solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature.
If you add more than 2000 grams of sugar to a liter of 20 °C water, the extra sugar won’t dissolve.
On the other hand, a solution containing less than 2000 g of sugar in 1 liter of 20 °C water can hold more sugar.
A solution that contains less solute than can dissolve at a given temperature is called an unsaturated solution .

Saturation Depends on the Solute
The Figure below shows the amounts of several different solutes that will dissolve in a liter of water at 20 °C.
As you can see from the graph, solutes vary greatly in how soluble they are in water.
For example, you can dissolve almost 20 times as much sugar as baking soda in the same amount of water at this temperature.
