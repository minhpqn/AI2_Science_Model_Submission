Can you think of other electronic devices that you use?
A:
Other examples include game systems and MP3 players.
Focus on the Computer
Let’s take a close look at the computer as an example of an electronic device.
A computer contains integrated circuits, or microchips, that consist of millions of tiny electronic components.
Information is encoded in digital electronic signals.
Rapid pulses of voltage switch electric current on and off, producing long strings of 1’s (current on) and 0’s (current off).
The 1’s and 0’s are the “letters” of the code, and a huge number of them are needed.
One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for “binary digit.” Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte.
Because a computer’s circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small.
The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals are pictured and described in the Figure below .
They include the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM.
The motherboard ties all these parts of the computer together.
