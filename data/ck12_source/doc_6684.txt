The position graph below is of the movement of a fast turtle who can turn on a dime. a.
Sketch the velocity vs. time graph of the turtle below. b.
Explain what the turtle is doing (including both speed and direction ) from: i) 0-2s. ii) 2-3s. iii) 3-4s. c.
How much distance has the turtle covered after 4s? {\;} d.
What is the turtle’s displacement after 4s? {\;}
Draw the position vs. time graph that corresponds to the velocity vs. time graph below.
You may assume a starting position x_0 = 0 .
Label the y- axis with appropriate values.
The following velocity-time graph represents 10 seconds of actress Halle Berry’s drive to work (it’s a rough morning).
a.
Fill in the tables below – remember that displacement and position are not the same thing!
Instantaneous Time (s)
b.
On the axes below, draw an acceleration-time graph for the car trip.
Include numbers on your acceleration axis.
c.
On the axes below, draw a position-time graph for the car trip.
Include numbers on your position axis.
Be sure to note that some sections of this graph are linear and some curve – why?
