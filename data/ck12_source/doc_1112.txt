Propose a hypothesis.
Test the hypothesis using data from observations and experiments.
Continue testing the hypothesis if it holds up or find a new hypothesis if it does not.
Eventually create a theory.
A theory is an explanation of a complicated set of phenomena.
A theory fits virtually all of the available data.
The theories of evolution, plate tectonics, and climate change are crucial to understanding Earth.
These theories may be revised, but they will almost certainly hold up.
Earth scientists learn about the world by using a lot of amazing tools and scientific principles.
To understand things that are small or far away, scientists use a microscope or a telescope.
To learn about things on the ground, they use a map.
Rocks and other Earth materials are analyzed in the lab.
Technology allows us to learn more about the oceans and space.
One of the most important principles—and the most important for understanding Earth history—is that "the present is the key to the past."
