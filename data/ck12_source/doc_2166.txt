For most of human history, people thought the Sun didn't change much.
But technology has offered us a window into the Sun's life.
SOHO and other technologies allow us to observe incredible sunspots, flares, and prominences.
Some of these are featured in this concept.
Surface Features of the Sun
The Sun has many incredible surface features.
Don't try to look at them, though!
Looking directly at the Sun can cause blindness.
Find the appropriate filters for a pair of binoculars or a telescope and enjoy!
The most noticeable magnetic activity of the Sun is the appearance of sunspots.
Sunspots are cooler, darker areas on the Sun’s surface ( Figure below ).
Sunspots occur in an 11-year cycle.
The number of sunspots begins at a minimum.
The number gradually increases to the maximum.
Then the number returns to a minimum again.
Sunspots form because loops of the Sun’s magnetic field break through the surface.
Sunspots usually occur in pairs.
The loop breaks through the surface where it comes out of the Sun.
It breaks through again where it goes back into the Sun.
Sunspots disrupt the transfer of heat from the Sun's lower layers.
