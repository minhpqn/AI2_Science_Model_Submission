Define the role of a ribosome.
Describe the functions of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus.
Explain the function of a vesicle, a vacuole, and a lysosome.
Do brain cells have the same internal structures as your other cells?
Yes.
Although brain cells look quite different from your other cells, they have the same internal structures as other cells.
They need the same structures because they need to perform the same tasks, such as making proteins and obtaining energy.
Eukaryotic cells have many specific functions, so it can be said that a cell is like a factory.
A factory has many machines and people, and each has a specific role.
Just like a factory, the cell is made up of many different parts.
Each part has a special role.
The different parts of the cell are called organelles , which means "small organs." All organelles are found in eukaryotic cells.
Prokaryotic cells are "simpler" than eukaryotic cells.
Though prokaryotic cells still have many functions, they are not as specialized as eukaryotic cells, lacking membrane-bound organelles.
Thus, most organelles are not found in prokaryotic cells.
Below are the main organelles found in eukaryotic cells ( Figure below
The nucleus of a cell is like a safe containing the factory's trade secrets.
The nucleus contains the genetic material (DNA), the information needed to build thousands of proteins.
The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell.
Mitochondria are the organelles where cellular energy is produced, providing the energy needed to power chemical reactions.
