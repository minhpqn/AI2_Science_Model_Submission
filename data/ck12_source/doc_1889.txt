A cast forms from the minerals that fill that hole and solidify

Why Fossilization is Rare
Itâ€™s very unlikely that any given organism will become a fossil.
The remains of many organisms are consumed.
Remains also may be broken down by other living things or by the elements.
Hard parts, such as bones, are much more likely to become fossils.
But even they rarely last long enough to become fossils.
Organisms without hard parts are the least likely to be fossilized.
Fossils of soft organisms, from bacteria to jellyfish, are very rare.
Very few fossils preserve soft parts.
