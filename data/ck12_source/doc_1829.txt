Runoff has eroded small channels through this bare field
Runoff has eroded small channels through this bare field.
Much of the material eroded by runoff is carried into bodies of water, such as streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, or oceans.
Runoff is an important cause of erosion.
That’s because it occurs over so much of Earth’s surface.
Erosion by Streams
Streams erode sediment from their banks.
They pick up and transport sediments.
A stream in the desert erodes the cliff face
A stream in the desert rushes past its banks.
The power of the water erodes the cliff face.
As a stream erodes its banks, it creates a V-shaped valley ( Figure above ).
This contrasts with the U-shaped valleys created by glaciers.
Erosion and Water Speed
Erosion by a stream depends on the velocity of the water.
Fast water erodes more material than slow water.
Eventually, the water deposits the materials.
As water slows, larger particles are deposited first.
As the water slows even more, smaller particles are deposited.
The graph pictured below ( Figure below ) shows how water velocity and particle size influence erosion and deposition.
