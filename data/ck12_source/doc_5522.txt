Give three examples of stored chemical energy.
What happens to the energy when an explosive goes off?
Why is food considered stored chemical energy?
How is the energy in coal harnessed?
Who invented dynamite?
How was the nitroglycerin made more stable?
What kind of energy is released when we burn natural gas?
How does burning gasoline power a car?
How do batteries create energy?
Explain how a hand-warmer works.
energy:  The ability to perform work.
chemical reaction:
Chemical reactions either require energy or release energy.
The amount of energy needed or released depends upon the structure of the molecules that are involved in the reaction.

How has chemistry made contributions to medicine?
Diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by the bodyâ€™s inability to use glucose (a component of table sugar).
Glucose is needed to provide biochemical energy for all the cells of the body.
When the body cannot make energy using glucose, it begins to break down fat and protein to provide the needed energy, eventually leading to death.
