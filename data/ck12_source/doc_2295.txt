Several types of evidence support Wegener’s ideas.
For example, similar fossils and rock formations have been found on continents that are now separated by oceans.
It is also now known that Earth’s crust consists of rigid plates that slide over molten rock below them.
This explains how continents can drift.
Even the shapes of today’s continents show how they once fit together, like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.
Science is a way of learning about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic.
The goal of science is to understand how and why things happen.
Science advances as new evidence accumulates and allows scientists to replace, refine, or expand on accepted ideas about the natural world.

Explain why inductive reasoning cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true.
The man in this photo is a police detective.
He’s examining and gathering clues that may help solve a crime.
Based on all of the clues he finds, he may be able to conclude who committed the crime.
Doing science is similar to solving crimes.
It also involves gathering evidence and drawing conclusions.
