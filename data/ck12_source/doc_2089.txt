These days, natural gas is becoming more popular as a fuel.
Natural gas is mostly methane.
Natural gas is usually found with petroleum.
People prefer to burn natural gas when possible because it is relatively clean.
How Natural Gas Forms
Natural gas is often found along with coal or oil in underground deposits.
This is because natural gas forms with these other fossil fuels.
One difference between natural gas and oil is that natural gas forms at higher temperatures.
Natural Gas Use
The largest natural gas reserves in the United States are located in the Rocky Mountain states, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico region.
California also has natural gas, mostly in the northern Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento Delta.
Natural gas must be processed before it can be used as a fuel.
Poisonous chemicals and water must be removed.
Natural gas is delivered to homes, where it is used for cooking and heating.
Natural gas is also a major energy source for powering turbines to make electricity.
Natural gas releases most of its energy as heat when it burns.
The power plant is able to use this heat, either in the form of hot gases or steam, to spin turbines.
The spinning turbines turn generators, and the generators create electricity.
Extracting Natural Gas
Most natural gas comes from the wells that produce petroleum.
