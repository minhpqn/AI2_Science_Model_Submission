What is the final step in the synthesis of a polymer?
addition polymer:  A polymer formed by chain addition reactions between monomers that contain a double bond.
monomer:  The small molecules which make up the polymer.
polymer:  A large molecule formed of many smaller molecules covalently bonded in a repeating pattern.

A Different Sound and Feel
Animal gut and silk were used for all guitar strings for centuries until modern technology and changes in musical taste brought about significant changes.
There are two major types of guitar strings in use today.
Steel strings (first developed around 1900) are found on acoustic and electric guitars.
They have a bright, crisp sound that lends itself well to diverse music as jazz, rock and roll, and bluegrass.
Nylon strings are a more recent development.
During World War II, the silk and animal products needed to manufacture steel guitar strings were not available.
Nylon quickly proved to be a more than adequate substitute.
Now nylon strings are found on all classical guitars.
Their sound is somewhat softer than the steel strings and the tone quality suits that genre of music better.
