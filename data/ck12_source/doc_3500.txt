As you can see, the cork was made up of many tiny units, which Hooke called cells.
An illustration of what Hooke saw when he looked at a slice of cork under his microscope
Cork Cells.
This is what Robert Hooke saw when he looked at a thin slice of cork under his microscope.
What type of material is cork?
Do you know where cork comes from?
Soon after Robert Hooke discovered cells in cork, Anton van Leeuwenhoek in Holland made other important discoveries using a microscope.
Leeuwenhoek made his own microscope lenses, and he was so good at it that his microscope was more powerful than other microscopes of his day.
In fact, Leeuwenhoek’s microscope was almost as strong as modern light microscopes.
Using his microscope, Leeuwenhoek discovered tiny animals such as rotifers.
Leeuwenhoek also discovered human blood cells.
He even scraped plaque from his own teeth and observed it under the microscope.
What do you think Leeuwenhoek saw in the plaque?
He saw tiny living things with a single cell that he named animalcules (“tiny animals”).
Today, we call Leeuwenhoek’s animalcules bacteria.
The Cell Theory
The Cell Theory is one of the fundamental theories of biology.
For two centuries after the discovery of the microscope by Robert Hooke and Anton van Leeuwenhoek, biologists found cells everywhere.
Biologists in the early part of the 19 th century suggested that all living things were made of cells, but the role of cells as the primary building block of life was not discovered until 1839 when two German scientists, Theodor Schwann, a zoologist (studies animals), and Matthias Jakob Schleiden, a botanist (studies plants), suggested that cells were the basic unit of structure and function of all life.
Later, in 1858, the German doctor Rudolf Virchow observed that cells divide to produce more cells.
