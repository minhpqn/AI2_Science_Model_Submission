Both archaea and bacteria have a single circular chromosome of DNA and lack membrane-bound organelles.
Like bacteria, archaea can have flagella to assist with movement.
Some archaea are rod-shaped
Archaea shapes can vary widely, but some are bacilli (rod-shaped).
Obtaining Food and Energy
Most archaea are chemotrophs and derive their energy and nutrients from breaking down molecules in their environment.
A few species of archaea are photosynthetic and capture the energy of sunlight.
Unlike bacteria, which can be parasites and are known to cause a variety of diseases, there are no known archaea that act as parasites.
Some archaea do live within other organisms.
But these archea form mutualistic relationships with their host, where both the archaea and the host benefit.
In other words, they assist the host in some way, for example by helping to digest food.
Like bacteria, reproduction in archaea is asexual.
Archaea can reproduce through binary fission , where a parent cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells.
Archaea can also reproduce asexually through budding and fragmentation, where pieces of the cell break off and form a new cell, also producing genetically identical organisms.
Archaea are prokaryotes, but they differ from bacteria in their DNA and biochemistry.
Most archaea are chemotrophs, but some are photosynthetic or form mutualistic relationships.
Archaea reproduce asexually through binary fission, fragmentation, or budding.
