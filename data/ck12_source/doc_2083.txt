Coal is mostly carbon, but some other elements can be found in coal, including sulfur.
The coal with the least sulfur is the cleanest coal.
Anthracite has very little sulfur and so is very desirable.
Chunks of coal, which is a solid hydrocarbon
Coal is a solid hydrocarbon formed from decaying plant material over millions of years.
To prepare coal for use, the coal is first crushed into powder and burned in a furnace.
Like other fuels, coal releases most of its energy as heat when it burns.
The heat from the burning coal is used to boil water.
This makes steam.
The steam spins turbines, which creates electricity.
