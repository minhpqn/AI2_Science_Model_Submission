Calculate the electric field a distance of 4.0\mathrm{mm} away from a -2.0\mu \mathrm{C} charge.
Then, calculate the force on a -8.0\mu \mathrm{C} charge placed at this point.
Answer :
To calculate the electric field we will use the equation E=\frac{kq}{r^2} Before we solve for the electric field by plugging in the values, we convert all of the values to the same units.
4.0\mathrm{mm}\times \frac{1\mathrm{m}}{1000\mathrm{mm}}&=.004\mathrm{m}\\\-2.0\mu \mathrm{C}\times \frac{1\mathrm{C}}{1000000\mu \mathrm{C}}&=-2.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C}
Now that we have consistent units we can solve the problem.
E=\frac{kq}{r^2}=\frac{9\times 10^9\mathrm{Nm^2/C^2}\times -2.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C}}{(.004\mathrm{m})^2}=-1.1\times 10^9\mathrm{N/C}
To solve for the force at the point we will use the equation F=Eq .
We already know all of the values so all we have to do is convert all of the values to the same units and then plug in the values.
-8.0\mu \mathrm{C}\times \frac{1\mathrm{C}}{1000000\mu \mathrm{C}}=-8.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C}\\\
F=Eq=-8.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C} \times -1.1 \times 10^9 \mathrm{N/C}=9000\mathrm{N}

What is the direction of the electric field if an electron initially at rest begins to move in the North direction as a result of the field?
Not enough information
Two metal plates have gained excess electrons in differing amounts through the application of rabbit fur.
The arrows indicate the direction of the electric field which has resulted.
Three electric potential lines, labeled A, B, and C are shown.
