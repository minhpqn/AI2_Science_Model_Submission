Different minerals that are the same color may have a different color streak.
For example, samples of hematite and galena are both dark gray.
They can be told apart because hematite has a red streak and galena has a gray streak.
Luster describes the way light reflects off of the surface of the mineral.
You might describe diamonds as sparkly or pyrite as shiny.
But mineralogists have special terms to describe luster.
They first divide minerals into metallic and non-metallic luster.
Minerals that are opaque and shiny, like pyrite, are said to have a “metallic” luster.
Minerals with a “non-metallic” luster do not look like metals.
There are many types of non-metallic luster.
Six are described below ( Table below ).
Like resins, such as tree sap
Soft-looking with long fibers
Can you match the minerals ( Figure below ) with the correct luster, listed above ( Table above ), without looking at the caption?
(A) Diamonds have an adamantine luster.
These minerals are transparent and highly reflective. (B) Kaolinite is a clay with a dull or earthy luster. (C) Opal’s luster is greasy. (D) Chalcopyrite, like its cousin pyrite, has metallic luster. (E) Stilbite (orange) has a resinous luster. (F) The white ulexite has silky luster. (G) Sphalerite has a submetallic luster. (H) Chert is a mineral with a waxy luster.
You are going to visit a friend.
You fill one backpack with books so you can study later.
You stuff your pillow into another backpack that is the same size.
Which backpack will be easier to carry?
