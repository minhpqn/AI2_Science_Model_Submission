The slope is steep and the landscape is like something from another planet.
Nothing's alive up there, except maybe a bird.
When you're standing on the top, you can see other Cascades volcanoes:
Mt.
Adams, Rainier, Hood, Jefferson, and sometimes more.
A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas escape from a magma chamber.
Volcanoes differ in many features, such as height, shape, and slope steepness.
Some volcanoes are tall cones, and others are just cracks in the ground ( Figure below ).
As you might expect, the shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma.
The three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones.
Mt.
Fuji is a composite volcano
Mt.
Fuji is a well-known composite volcano.
Figure above shows Mt.
Fuji, a classic example of a composite volcano.
Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides.
These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top.
The crater was created during the volcano's last eruption.
Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes.
