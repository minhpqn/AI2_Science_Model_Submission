Properties of Magnets
Describe magnetic fields around permanent magnets.
Understand ferromagnetism and magnetic domains.
Describe some properties of magnets.
Maglev trains are held up using magnetic fields
Some countries are using powerful electromagnets to develop high-speed trains, called maglev, or magnetic levitation, trains.
These trains use the repulsive force of magnets to float over a guide way, removing the friction of steel wheels and train tracks.
Reducing this friction allows the trains to travel at much higher speeds.
Properties of Magnets
Any magnet , regardless of its shape, has two ends called poles where the magnetic effect is strongest.
If a magnet is suspended by a fine thread, it is found that one pole of the magnet will always point toward the north.
This fact has been made use of in navigation since the eleventh century.
The pole of the magnet that seeks the north pole is called the north pole of the magnet, while the opposite side is the south pole.
It is a familiar fact that when two magnets are brought near one another, the magnets exert a force on each other.  The magnetic force can be either attractive or repulsive.
If two north poles or two south poles are brought near each other, the force will be repulsive.
If a north pole is brought near a south pole, the force will be attractive.
Illustration of magnetic north compared to geographic north
The Earth's geographic north pole (which is close to, but not exactly at the magnetic pole) attracts the north poles of magnets.
We know, therefore, that this pole is actually the Earth's magnetic south pole.
This can be seen in the image above; the geographic north and south poles are labeled with barber shop poles, and the Earth's magnetic poles are indicated with the double-headed arrow.
