What composition of lava flows most easily?
What effect does silica content have on magma?
What type of volcano produces lava with a low viscosity?
What type of lava viscosity does a stratovolcano have?
What type of lava viscosity does a caldera have?
What type of rock is created by a caldera eruption?
About what is it's silica content?
What is the role of a magma chamber in a volcanic eruption?
How is magma composition related to viscosity?
Compare and contrast a'a, pahoehoe, and pillow lavas.
Describe the causes and effects of explosive volcanic eruptions.
Define lahar, pyroclast, and pyroclastic flow.
What would cause a giant explosion like this one?
The type of eruption a volcano has depends on the composition of the magma.
Silica-rich, felsic magma can trap a lot of gas.
So these magmas produce explosive eruptions.
Silica-poor mafic magmas trap little gas.
These magmas produce quiet eruptions.
Which type of eruption do you think is safest to be near?
