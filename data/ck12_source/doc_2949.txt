Motion and Forces
It’s a bird!
It’s plane!
It’s a super skateboarder!
This boy appears to be flying high in the sky, but he can’t stay airborne for long.
Gravity will soon pull him back to the ground.
How was he able to overcome the force of gravity and rise into the air?
In this unit, you’ll learn about forces such as gravity and motions such as skateboarding, including how skateboarders can seem to defy gravity.
Along the way, you can also pick up some cool skateboarding tips!
Explain how frame of reference is related to motion.
The wings of this hummingbird are moving so fast that they’re just a blur of motion.
You can probably think of many other examples of things in motion.
If you can’t, just look around you.
It’s likely that you’ll see something moving, and if nothing else, your eyes will be moving.
So you know from experience what motion is.
No doubt it seems like a fairly simple concept.
However, when you read this article, you’ll find out that it’s not quite as simple as it seems.
In science, motion is defined as a change in position.
An object’s position is its location.
Besides the wings of the hummingbird in the opening image, you can see other examples of motion in the Figure below .
