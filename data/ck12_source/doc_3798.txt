By the time Darwin finally returned to England, he had become famous as a naturalist.
During the long voyage, Darwin made many observations that helped him form his theory of evolution.
For example:
He visited tropical rainforests and other new habitats where he saw many plants and animals he had never seen before (see Figure below ).
This impressed him with the great diversity of life.
He experienced an earthquake that lifted the ocean floor 2.7 meters (9 feet) above sea level.
He also found rocks containing fossil sea shells in mountains high above sea level.
These observations suggested that continents and oceans had changed dramatically over time and continue to change in dramatic ways.
He visited rock ledges that had clearly once been beaches that had gradually built up over time.
This suggested that slow, steady processes also change Earth’s surface.
He dug up fossils of gigantic extinct mammals, such as the ground sloth (see Figure below ).
This was hard evidence that organisms looked very different in the past.
It suggested that living things—like Earth’s surface—change over time.
Animals in the Galapagos: giant marine iguana, blue-footed booby, giant ground sloth
On his voyage, Darwin saw giant marine iguanas and blue-footed boobies.
He also dug up the fossil skeleton of a giant ground sloth like the one shown here.

The Galápagos Islands
Darwin’s most important observations were made on the Galápagos Islands (see map in Figure below ).
