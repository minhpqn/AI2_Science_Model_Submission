Gregor Mendel, the "father" of genetics.
To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits ( Figure below ).
For example, pea plants are either tall or short, which is an easy trait to observe.
Furthermore, pea plants grow quickly, so he could complete many experiments in a short period of time.
The Laws of Heredity
Characteristics of pea plants.
Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate or be cross-pollinated .
Self-pollination means that only one flower is involved; the flower's own pollen lands on the female sex organs.
Cross pollination is done by hand by moving pollen from one flower to the stigma of another (just like bees do naturally).
As a result, one plant's sex cells combine with another plant's sex cells.
This is called a "cross." These crosses produce offspring (or "children"), just like when male and female animals mate.
Since Mendel could move pollen between plants, he could carefully control and then observe the results of crosses between two different types of plants.
He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas, including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds, white flowers versus purple flowers, and tall plants versus short plants.
Because of his work, Mendel is considered the "Father of Genetics."
Mendel's First Experiment
In one of Mendel's early experiments, he crossed a short plant and a tall plant.
What do you predict the offspring of these plants were?
Medium-sized plants?
Most people during Mendel's time would have said medium-sized.
But an unexpected result occurred.
