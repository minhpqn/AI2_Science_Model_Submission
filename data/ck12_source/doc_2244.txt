How do stars generate so much energy?
Stars shine because of nuclear fusion .
Fusion reactions in the Sun's core keep our nearest star burning.
Stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
Both are very light gases, but a star contains so much hydrogen and helium that its total mass is enormous.
The pressure at the center of a star is great enough to heat the gases.
This causes nuclear fusion reactions.
A nuclear fusion reaction is so named because the nuclei (center) of atoms fuse (join) together in the process.
In stars like our Sun, hydrogen atoms join together to create a helium atom.
Nuclear fusion reactions need a lot of energy to get started.
Once they begin, they produce even more energy. ( Figure below ).
A thermonuclear bomb is an uncontrolled fusion reaction in which enormous amounts of energy are released

Scientists have built machines called particle accelerators .
These amazing tools smash particles that are smaller than atoms into each other head-on.
This creates new particles.
Scientists use particle accelerators to learn about nuclear fusion in stars.
They can also learn about how atoms came together in the first few minutes of the Universe.
Two well-known accelerators are SLAC, in California, and CERN, in Switzerland ( Figure below ).
Particle accelerators are used to learn about nuclear fusion in stars and about conditions in the first few minutes of the universe
