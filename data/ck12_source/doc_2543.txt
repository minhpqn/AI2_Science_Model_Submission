The particles seemed to be passing through empty space.
Only a few of the alpha particles were deflected from their straight path, as Rutherford had predicted.
Surprisingly, a tiny percentage of the particles bounced back from the foil like a basketball bouncing off a backboard!

Q:
What can you infer from these observations?
A:
You can infer that most of the alpha particles were not repelled by any positive charge, whereas a few were repelled by a strong positive charge.
The Nucleus Takes Center Stage
Rutherford made the same inferences.
He concluded that all of the positive charge and virtually all of the mass of an atom are concentrated in one tiny area and the rest of the atom is mostly empty space.
Rutherford called the area of concentrated positive charge the nucleus.
He predicted—and soon discovered—that the nucleus contains positively charged particles, which he named protons.
Rutherford also predicted the existence of neutral nuclear particles called neutrons, but he failed to find them.
However, his student James Chadwick discovered them several years later.

The Planetary Model
Rutherford’s discoveries meant that Thomson’s plum pudding model was incorrect.
Positive charge is not spread evenly throughout an atom.
Instead, it is all concentrated in the tiny nucleus.
