Besides electrical, chemical, and thermal energy, some other forms of energy include mechanical and sound energy.
Any of these forms of energy can change into any other form.
Often, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms.
For example, the popcorn machine below changes electrical energy to thermal energy.
The thermal energy, in turn, changes to both mechanical energy and sound energy.
You can read the Figure below how these changes happen.
You can see other examples of energy changing form at this URL:
Energy transfer to popcorn in a popcorn machine
The popcorn machine changes electrical to thermal energy, which heats the popcorn. 2.
The heat causes the popcorn to pop.
You can see that the popping corn has mechanical energy (energy of movement).
It overflows the pot and falls into the pile of popcorn at the bottom of the machine. 3.
The popping corn also has energy.
That's why it makes popping sounds.
Kinetic-Potential Energy Changes
Mechanical energy commonly changes between kinetic and potential energy.
Kinetic energy is the energy of moving objects.
Potential energy is energy that is stored in objects, typically because of their position or shape.
Kinetic energy can be used to change the position or shape of an object, giving it potential energy.
Potential energy gives the object the potential to move.
