How did the animal cross Europe and into Asia?
Or Asia into America?
How did anything get into Australia?
Evidence from Biogeography
Biogeography is the study of how and why plants and animals live where they do.
It provides more evidence for evolution.
Let’s consider the camel family as an example.
Biogeography of Camels:
An Example
Today, the camel family includes different types of camels.
They are shown in Figure below .
All of today’s camels are descended from the same camel ancestors.
These ancestors lived in North America about a million years ago.
Camel migration patterns, and comparisons of camels and llamas
Camel Migrations and Present-Day Variation.
Members of the camel family now live in different parts of the world.
They differ from one another in a number of traits.
However, they share basic similarities.
This is because they all evolved from a common ancestor.
What differences and similarities do you see?
