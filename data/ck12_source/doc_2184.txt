This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth.
The side of the Moon that always faces Earth is called the near side.
The side of the Moon that always faces away from Earth is called the far side.
From Earth, people have only seen the Moon's near side.
The far side has only been seen by spacecraft and Apollo astronauts.
The Moon has no atmosphere.
With no atmosphere, the Moon is not protected from extreme temperatures.
The average surface temperature during the day is approximately 107°C (225°F).
Daytime temperatures can reach as high as 123°C (253°F).
At night, the average temperature drops to -153°C (-243°F).
The lowest temperatures measured are as low as -233°C (-397°F).
We all know what the Moon looks like.
It's always looked the same during our lifetime.
In fact, the Moon has looked the same to every person who has looked up at it for all time.
Even the dinosaurs, trilobites, or cyanobacteria, should they have looked up at it, would have seen more-or-less the same thing.
This is not true of Earth.
Natural processes continually alter Earth’s surface.
Without these processes, would Earth's surface resemble the Moon's?
The Moon does have more craters than it did in the long distant past, of course.
Even though we can't see it from Earth, the Moon has changed recently too.
