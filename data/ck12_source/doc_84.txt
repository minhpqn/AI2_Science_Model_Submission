The marbled salamander ( left ) shows the typical salamander body plan: slender body, short legs, long tail, and moist skin.
Caecilian ( right ) are a type of legless amphibian most closely related to salamanders.
How Do Salamanders Breathe?
Different salamanders breathe in different ways.
In those that have gills, breathing occurs through the gills as water passes over the gill slits.
Sirens keep their gills all their lives, which allows them to breathe underwater.
Species that live on land lose their gills as they grow older.
These salamanders develop lungs that are used in breathing, much like breathing in mammals.
Other land-living salamanders do not have lungs or gills.
These are called lungless salamanders.
Instead, they "breathe," or exchange gases, through their skin.
This requires blood vessels that exchange gases to be spread throughout the skin.
How Big Are Salamanders?
Salamanders are generally small.
However, some can reach a foot or more, as in the mudpuppy of North America.
In Japan and China, the giant salamander reaches 6 feet and weighs up to 66 pounds ( Figure below ).
