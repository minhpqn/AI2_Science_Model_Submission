The relative sizes of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
This image shows the four outer planets and the Sun, with sizes to scale.
From left to right, the outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium.
These are the same elements that make up most of the Sun.
Astronomers think that most of the nebula was hydrogen and helium.
The inner planets lost these very light gases.
Their gravity was too low to keep them, and they floated away into space.
The Sun and the outer planets had enough gravity to keep the hydrogen and helium.
All of the outer planets have numerous moons.
They also have planetary rings made of dust and other small particles.
Only the rings of Saturn can be easily seen from Earth.
The four inner planets have slower orbits, slower spin, no rings, and they are made of rock and metal.
The four outer planets have faster orbits and spins, a composition of gases and liquids, numerous moons, and rings.
The outer planets are made of hydrogen and helium, so they are called gas giants.
