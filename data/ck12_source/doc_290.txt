What formula is given for kinetic energy?
Practice problems involving kinetic energy:
A comet with a mass of 7.85 \times 10^{11} \ \text{kg}  is moving with a velocity of 25,000 m/s.
Calculate its kinetic energy.
A rifle can shoot a 4.00 g bullet at a speed of 998 m/s.
Find the kinetic energy of the bullet.
What work is done on the bullet if it starts from rest?
If the work is done over a distance of 0.75 m, what is the average force on the bullet?
If the bullet comes to rest after penetrating 1.50 cm into a piece of metal, what is the magnitude of the force bringing it to rest?
