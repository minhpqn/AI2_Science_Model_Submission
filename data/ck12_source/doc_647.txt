In a hydraulic lift whose IMA is 50, how far (ideally) will the output platform be lifted when the input platform is depressed cm?
A 20.0 N force is exerted on the small piston of a hydraulic system.  The cross-sectional area of the small piston is 0.0500 m 2 .  What is the magnitude of the weight than can be lifted by the large piston, which has a cross-sectional area of 0.100 m 2 ?
Pascal’s principle:
Pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every part of the fluid, as well as to the walls of the container.
hydraulic lift:
A type of machine that uses a hydraulic apparatus to lift or move objects using the force created when pressure is exerted on liquid in a piston.
Archimedes' Principle and Buoyancy
State Archimedes’ Principle.
Make calculations of buoyancy.
Make calculations of floating objects’ displacement.
Cargo ship displaces water equal to its mass
This cargo ship displaces an amount of water such that the weight of the displaced water is exactly equal to the weight of the ship and its cargo.
The displacement of water is what produces the buoyancy to float this ship.
When this photo was taken, the ship was empty so it did not sink very deep in the water to displace the necessary weight.
When this ship is fully loaded with cargo, the water line will be where the black paint meets the red paint.
Archimedes’ Principle and Buoyancy
If an object is submerged in a liquid, the object displaces a volume of the liquid equal to the volume of the submerged object.
Legend has it that this observation was made by Archimedes when he sat in a bath tub that was filled to the top of the tub.
The volume of water that overflowed was equal to his own volume.
The forces exerted by the fluid on the sides of the submerged object are balanced.
