The use of light in devices such as these is possible because of optics.
Optics and Optical Instruments
Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to extend human vision and do other tasks.
Knowledge of light was needed for the invention of optical instruments such as microscopes, telescopes, and cameras, in addition to optical fibers.
These instruments use mirrors and lenses to reflect and refract light and form images.
Q:
What is an image?
A:
An image is a copy of an object created by the reflection or refraction of visible light.
A light microscope is an instrument that uses lenses to make enlarged images of objects that are too small for the unaided eye to see.
A common type of light microscope is a compound microscope, like the one shown in the Figure below .
A compound microscope has at least two convex lenses: one or more objective lenses and one or more eyepiece lenses.
The objective lenses are close to the object being viewed.
They form an enlarged image of the object inside the microscope.
The eyepiece lenses are close to the viewerâ€™s eyes.
They form an enlarged image of the first image.
The magnifications of all the lenses are multiplied together to yield the overall magnification of the microscope.
Some light microscopes can magnify objects more than 1000 times!
