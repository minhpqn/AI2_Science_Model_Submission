These "X-shaped" structures ensure that each cell receives the proper amount of DNA during cell division.
The DNA coils into these structures that makes proper separation during mitosis and meiosis possible.
Chromosomes and Genes
The human genome consists of 24 distinct chromosomes: 22 autosomal chromosomes plus the sex-determining X and Y chromosomes.
A chromosome is a threadlike molecule of genes and other DNA located in the nucleus of a cell.
Different organisms have different numbers of chromosomes.
Human somatic cells have 23 chromosome pairs for a total of 46 chromosomes: two copies of the 22 autosomes (one from each parent), plus an X chromosome from the mother and either an X or Y chromosome from the father ( Figure below ).
The human genome has 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the nucleus of somatic cells.
Each chromosome is composed of genes and other DNA wound around histones (proteins) into a tightly coiled molecule.
Human Chromosomes.
Human chromosomes are shown here arranged by size.
Chromosome 1 is the largest, and chromosome 22 is the smallest.
All normal human cells (except gametes) have two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes per cell.
Only one of each pair is shown here.
Human Chromosomes.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Pairs 1-22 are autosomes.
Females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y chromosome.
There are an estimated 20,000-23,000 human protein-coding genes, but many more proteins.
Most human genes have multiple eons (coding sequences) separated by much larger introns (non-coding sequences).
