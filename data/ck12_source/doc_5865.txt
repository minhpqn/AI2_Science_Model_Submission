nitrite (NO 2 - )
nitrous acid (HNO 2 )
The three different suffixes that are possible for the anions lead to the three rules below.
When the anion ends in – ide, the acid name begins with the prefix hydro -.
The root of the anion name goes in the blank ( chlor for chloride), followed by the suffix –ic .
HCl is hydrochloric acid because Cl - is the chloride ion.
HCN is hydrocyanic acid because CN - is the cyanide ion.
When the anion ends in – ate, the name of the acid is the root of the anion followed by the suffix –ic .
There is no prefix.
H 2 SO 4 is sulfuric acid (not sulfic) because SO 4 2- is the sulfate ion.
When the anion ends in – ite, the name of the acid is the root of the anion followed by the suffix –ous .
Again, there is no prefix.
HNO 2 is nitrous acid because NO 2 - is the nitrite ion.
Note how the root for a sulfur-containing oxoacid is sulfur- instead of just sulf-.
The same is true for a phosphorus-containing oxoacid.
The root is phosphor- instead of simply phosph-.
Many foods and beverages contain citric acid.
Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid.
Car batteries contain sulfuric acid that helps in the release of electrons to create electricity.
