Some of the changes that occur in boys during puberty are shown in this figure.
Pubic hair grows, and the penis and testes both become larger.
Adolescent Growth Spurt
Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth.
This is called the adolescent growth spurt .
In boys, it is controlled by testosterone.
The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty.
At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male.
Growth generally remains rapid for several years.
Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height.
Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.
The male reproductive system forms before birth but does not become capable of reproduction until it matures during puberty.
Puberty lasts from about ages 12 to 18 years and is controlled by hormones.
