The process of maintaining a stable environment inside a cell or an entire organism.
natural selection :
Evolutionary process by which certain beneficial traits becomes more common within a population, changing the characteristics (traits) of a species over time.
Four unifying principles form the foundation of modern biology: cell theory, evolutionary theory, the gene theory and the principle of homeostasis.
