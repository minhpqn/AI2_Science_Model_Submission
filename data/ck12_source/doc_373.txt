How can you make the most healthy decisions?
Choosing Healthy Foods
Foods such as whole grain breads, fresh fruits, and fish provide nutrients you need for good health.
But different foods give you different types of nutrients.
You also need different amounts of each nutrient.
How can you choose the right mix of foods to get the proper balance of nutrients?
Three tools can help you choose foods wisely:
MyPyramid, MyPlate, and food labels.
MyPyramid ( Figure below ) is a diagram that shows how much you should eat each day of foods from six different food groups.
It recommends the amount of nutrients you need based on your age, your gender, and your level of activity.
The six food groups in MyPyramid are:
Grains, such as bread, rice, pasta, and cereal.
Vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes.
Fruits, such as oranges, apples, bananas, and strawberries.
Oils, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, and peanut oil.
Dairy, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other cheeses.
Meat and beans, such as chicken, fish, soybeans, and kidney beans.
