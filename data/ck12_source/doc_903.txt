Pollution adds chemicals, noise, heat, or even light to an environment.
This can have many different harmful effects on all kinds of organisms.
For example, the pesticide DDT nearly eliminated the peregrine falcon in some parts of the world.
This pesticide caused falcons to lay eggs with thinner shells.
As a result, fewer falcon eggs survived to hatching.
Populations of peregrine falcons declined rapidly.
DDT was then banned in the U.S. and peregrine falcon populations have recovered.
Water pollution threatens vital freshwater and marine resources throughout the world ( Figure below ).
Specifically, industrial and agricultural chemicals, waste, and acid rain threaten water.
As water is essential for all ecosystems, water pollution can result in the extinction of species.

A bird that was the victim of an oil spill.
About 58,000 gallons of oil spilled from a South Korea-bound container ship when it struck a tower supporting the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in dense fog in November, 2007.
Finally, soil contamination can also result in extinction.
Soil contamination can come from toxic industrial and municipal wastes ( Figure below ), salts from irrigation, and pesticides from agriculture.
These all degrade the soil as well.
As soil is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems, this can result in extinction.
