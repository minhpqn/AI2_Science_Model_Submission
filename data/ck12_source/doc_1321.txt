Explain how scientists attempt to predict earthquakes.
Are seismic waves like ocean waves?
Yes, in some ways.
Ocean waves travel at the interface between the sea surface and the atmosphere.
They have all the features that all waves have.
Some seismic waves also travel at an interface.
Which ones?
Seismic waves are the energy from earthquakes.
Seismic waves move outward in all directions away from their source.
Each type of seismic wave travels at different speeds in different materials.
All seismic waves travel through rock, but not all travel through liquid or gas.
Geologists study seismic waves to learn about earthquakes and the Earthâ€™s interior.
Seismic waves are just one type of wave.
Sound and light also travel in waves.
Every wave has a high point called a crest and a low point called a trough .
The height of a wave from the center line to its crest is its amplitude .
The horizontal distance between waves from crest to crest (or trough to trough) is its wavelength ( Figure below

The energy from earthquakes travels in waves, such as the one shown in this diagram.
