In pure water, the hydronium ion concentration is very low.
Only about one in ten million water molecules naturally dissociates to form a hydronium ion in pure water.
This gives water a pH of 7.
The hydronium ions in pure water are also balanced by hydroxide ions, so pure water is neutral (neither an acid nor a base).
Because pure water is neutral, any other solution with the same hydronium ion concentration and pH is also considered to be neutral.
If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions and lower pH than pure water, it is called an acid .
If a solution has a lower concentration of hydronium ions and higher pH than pure water, it is called a base .
Several acids and bases and their pH values are identified on the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14, in Figure below
Acidity and the pH Scale.
Water has a pH of 7, so this is the point of neutrality on the pH scale.
Acids have a pH less than 7, and bases have a pH greater than 7.
Approximate pHs of examples are depicted.
The pH scale is a negative logarithmic scale.
Because the scale is negative, as the ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases.
In other words, the more acidic the solution, the lower the pH value.
Because the scale is logarithmic, each one-point change in pH reflects a ten-fold change in the hydronium ion concentration and acidity.
For example, a solution with a pH of 6 is ten times as acidic as pure water with a pH of 7.
An acid can be defined as a hydrogen ion donor.
The hydrogen ions bond with water molecules, leading to a higher concentration of hydronium ions than in pure water.
For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissolves in pure water, it donates hydrogen ions (H + ) to water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H 3 O + ) and chloride ions (Cl - ).
