scientific law :
A principle which can be used to predict the behavior of the natural world.
scientific theory :
A hypothesis which has stood up to repeated attempts at falsification; supported by a great deal of data and evidence.
superseded theory :
A theory that was once commonly accepted, but is no longer considered the most complete description of reality by mainstream science.
Scientific theories are hypotheses which have stood up to repeated attempts at falsification and are thus supported by much data and evidence.
Scientific laws are similar to scientific theories in that they are principles which can be used to predict the behavior of the natural world.
A scientific theory must be supported by many strands of evidence rather than a single foundation, ensuring that it is probably a good approximation, if not totally correct.
A superseded scientific theory is a theory that was once commonly accepted, but is no longer considered the most complete description of reality by mainstream science.
