These changes influence how the nucleus attracts electrons.
In general, the ionization energy of an atom will increase as we move from left to right across the periodic table.
There are several exceptions to the general increase in ionization energy across a period.
The elements of Group 13 (B, Al, etc.) have lower ionization energies than the elements of Group 2 (Be, Mg, etc.).
This is an illustration of a concept called “ electron shielding .” Outer electrons are partially shielded from the attractive force of the protons in the nucleus by inner electrons.
Diagram of the shielding effect
The shielding effect is shown by the interior electron cloud (light blue) shielding the outer electron of interest from the full attractive force of the nucleus.
A larger shielding effect results in a decrease in ionization energy.
To explain how shielding works, consider a lithium atom.
It has three protons and three electrons – two in the first principal energy level and its valence electron in the second.
The valence electron is partially shielded from the attractive force of the nucleus by the two inner electrons.
Removing that valence electron becomes easier because of the shielding effect.
There is also a shielding effect that occurs between sublevels within the same principal energy level.
Specifically, an electron in the “ s ” sublevel is capable of shielding electrons in the “ p ” sublevel of the same principal energy level.
This is because of the spherical shape of the “ s ” orbital.
The reverse is not true – electrons in “ p ” orbitals do not shield electrons in “ s ” orbitals.
3s orbital shielding the 3p orbital
The spherical 3 s orbital exhibits a shielding effect on the dumbbell shaped 3 p orbital that is of slightly higher energy.
This reduces the ionization energy of a 3 p electron compared to a 3 s electron.
The electron being removed from an Al atom is a 3 p electron, which is shielded by the two 3 s electrons as well as all the inner core electrons .
