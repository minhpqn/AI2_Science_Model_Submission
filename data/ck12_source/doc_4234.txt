How did the behavior evolve?
How does it compare with similar behaviors in related species?
In what ancestor did the behavior first appear?
Evolution of Animal Behavior
To the extent that behaviors are controlled by genes, they may evolve through natural selection.
If behaviors increase fitness , they are likely to become more common over time.
If they decrease fitness, they are likely to become less common.
Nature vs.
Nurture
Some behaviors seem to be controlled solely by genes.
Others appear to be due to experiences in a given environment.
Whether behaviors are controlled mainly by genes or by the environment is often a matter of debate.
This is called the nature-nurture debate .
Nature refers to the genes an animal inherits.
Nurture refers to the environment that the animal experiences.
In reality, most animal behaviors are not controlled by nature or nurture alone.
Instead, they are influenced by both nature and nurture.
In dogs, for example, the tendency to behave toward other dogs in a certain way is probably controlled by genes.
However, the normal behaviors canâ€™t develop in an environment that lacks other dogs.
A puppy raised in isolation from other dogs may never develop the normal behaviors.
