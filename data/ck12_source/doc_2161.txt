It does, however, have a definite internal structure with identifiable layers ( Figure below ).
Since the layers are not solid, the boundaries are fuzzy and indistinct.
From inward to outward, the layers are: the core, the radiative zone, and the convection zone.
The layers of the Sun
The layers of the Sun.
The core is the Sun's innermost layer.
The core is plasma.
It has a temperature of around 15 million degrees Celsius (°C).
Nuclear fusion reactions create the immense temperature.
In these reactions, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium.
This releases vast amounts of energy.
The energy moves toward the outer layers of the Sun.
Energy from the Sun's core powers most of the solar system.
The radiative zone is the next layer out.
It has a temperature of about 4 million °C.
Energy from the core travels through the radiative zone.
The energy travels at an extremely slow rate.
Light particles are called photons .
In the radiative zone, photons can only travel a few millimeters before they hit another particle.
The particles are absorbed and then released again.
