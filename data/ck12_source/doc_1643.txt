Yeast (single-celled eukaryotic organisms) perform alcoholic fermentation in the absence of oxygen.
The products of alcoholic fermentation are ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) and carbon dioxide gas.
This process is used to make common food and drinks.
For example, alcoholic fermentation is used to bake bread.
The carbon dioxide bubbles allow the bread to rise and become fluffy.
Meanwhile, the alcohol evaporates.
In wine making, the sugars of grapes are fermented to produce wine.
The sugars are the starting materials for glycolysis.
Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation.
Lactic acid is a waste product of this process.
Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough.
The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise.
Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt.
The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken.
Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.
Pictured below are some products of fermentation ( Figure below ).
Cheese and wine are both made from fermentation
Products of fermentation include cheese (lactic acid fermentation) and wine (alcoholic fermentation).
Behind every fart is an army of gut bacteria undergoing some crazy biochemistry.
These bacteria break down the remains of digested food through fermentation, creating gas in the process.
