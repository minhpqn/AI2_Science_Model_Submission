Interpret a pedigree to determine the mode of inheritance.
What's a pedigree?
When you are talking about a pedigree dog, it means the dog is purebred.
Through selective breeding, the dog has all the traits of that particular breed.
When talking about genetics, however, a pedigree is a chart that helps show family relationships.
A pedigree is a chart that shows the inheritance of a trait over several generations.
A pedigree is commonly created for families, and it outlines the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders and traits.
A pedigree can help predict the probability that offspring will inherit a genetic disorder.
Pictured below is a pedigree displaying recessive inheritance of a disorder through three generations ( Figure below ).
From studying a pedigree, scientists can determine the following:
If the trait is sex-linked (on the X or Y chromosome) or autosomal (on a chromosome that does not determine sex).
If the trait is inherited in a dominant or recessive fashion.
