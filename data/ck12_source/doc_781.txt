In the same way, we can imagine a magnetic field surrounding a magnetic pole.
The force that one magnet exerts on another can be described as the interaction between one magnet and the magnetic field of the other magnet.
Magnetic field lines go from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole.
We define the magnetic field at any point as a vector (represented by the letter B ) whose direction is from north to south magnetic poles.
Any magnet has two ends called poles where the magnetic effect is strongest.
The magnetic pole found at the north geographical pole of the earth is a south magnetic pole.
The force that one magnet exerts on another can be described as the interaction between one magnet and the magnetic field of the other magnet.
Magnetic field lines go from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole.

In the video, one object rests on top of the magnetic field of another.
Compare the friction between these two objects to the friction between a saucer and a table the saucer rests on.
The earthâ€™s magnetic field
has a north magnetic pole at exactly the same spot as the geographical north pole.

all of these are true.
none of these are true.
