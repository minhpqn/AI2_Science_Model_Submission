This is because the space between the bones is filled with a thick fluid, called synovial fluid , that cushions the joint (see Figure below ).
A movable, or synovial, joint is protected and cushioned by cartilage and synovial fluid.
There are a variety of types of movable joints, which are illustrated in Figure below .
The joints are classified by how they move.
For example, a ball-and-socket joint , such as the shoulder, has the greatest range of motion, allowing movement in several directions.
Other movable joints, including hinge joints such as the knee, allow less movement.

Types of Movable Joints in the Human Skeleton.
Movable joints can move in a variety of ways.
Try moving each of the joints indicated in the diagram.
Can you tell how their movements differ?
Other joints in the human skeleton that are not depicted here include saddle, ellipsoid, and plane joints.
Joints are places where two or more bones of the skeleton meet.
With the help of muscles, joints allow the body to move with relatively little force.
Some joints can move more than others.
