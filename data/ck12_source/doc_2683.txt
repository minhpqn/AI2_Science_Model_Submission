You know because the bubbles are evidence that a gas has been produced and production of a gas is a sign of a chemical reaction.
Potential signs that chemical reactions have occurred include a change in color, change in temperature, production of a gas, and production of a solid precipitate.

How can you tell whether a change in matter is caused by a chemical reaction?
When water freezes, it changes to ice.
Is this a chemical reaction?
Why or why not?
Describe the general form of a chemical equation.
Show how to write a simple chemical equation.
Explain what it means for a chemical equation to be balanced.
Look at this rusty bike.
It has been left outside in damp weather too many times, so the iron in the metal parts has rusted.
Iron rusts when it combines with oxygen in the air.
Iron rusting is an example of a chemical reaction.
In a chemical reaction, substances change into entirely different substances.
For example, the iron in the bike and the oxygen in the air have changed into rust.
Q:
How could you represent this reaction, besides just describing it in words?
