The small intestine is much longer than the large intestine.
So why is it called “small”?
If you compare small and large intestines ( Figure above ), you will see the small intestine is smaller in width than the large intestine.
The large intestine is a wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus.
In adults, it is about five feet long.
Waste enters the large intestine from the small intestine in a liquid state.
As the waste moves through the large intestine, excess water is absorbed from it.
After the excess water is absorbed, the remaining solid waste is called feces.
Circular muscles control the anus.
They relax to let the feces pass out of the body through the anus.
After feces pass out of the body, they are called stool.
Releasing the stool from the body is referred to as a bowel movement.
The main organs of the digestive system are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.
