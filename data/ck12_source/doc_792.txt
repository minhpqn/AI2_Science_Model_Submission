Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field.
Two major advantages of electromagnets are that they are extremely strong magnetic fields, and that the magnetic field can be turned on and off.
When the current flows through the coil, it is a powerful magnet, but when the current is turned off, the magnetic field essentially disappears.
Electromagnets find use in many practical applications.
Electromagnets are used to lift large masses of magnetic materials such as scrap iron, rolls of steel, and auto parts.

The overhead portion of this machine (painted yellow) is a lifting electromagnet.
It is lowered to the deck where steel pipe is stored and it picks up a length of pipe and moves it to another machine where it is set upright and lowered into an oil well drill hole.
Electromagnets are essential to the design of the electric generator and electric motor and are also employed in doorbells, circuit breakers, television receivers, loudspeakers, electric dead bolts, car starters, clothes washers, atomic particle accelerators, and electromagnetic brakes and clutches.
Electromagnets are commonly used as switches in electrical machines.
A recent use for industrial electromagnets is to create magnetic levitation systems for bullet trains.
A solenoid is a long coil of wire consisting of many loops of wire that makes a complete circuit.
An electormagnet is a piece of iron inside a solenoid.
While the magnetic field of a solenoid may be quite large, an electromagnet has a significantly larger magnetic field.
Electromagnets' magnetic fields can be easily turned off by just halting the current.
