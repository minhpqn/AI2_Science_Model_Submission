How does oxygen move across the membrane?
Define active transport.
Describe the process of active transport.
Summarize the role of the sodium-potassium pump.
What does it take to roll a stone uphill?
This round stone tends to roll downhill due to the force of gravity.
It takes an input of energy to push it uphill.
Due to diffusion, molecules tend to move from an area of a large amount to an area of a small amount.
So guess what it takes to move molecules the opposite way, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration?
Energy, of course!
During active transport, molecules move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration.
This is the opposite of diffusion , and these molecules are said to flow against their concentration gradient.
Active transport is called "active" because this type of transport requires energy to move molecules.
ATP is the most common source of energy for active transport.
As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance.
A carrier protein is always required in this process.
Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration.
These proteins are often called "pumps" because they use energy to pump the molecules across the membrane.
There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules.
For example, your nerve cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active transport.
