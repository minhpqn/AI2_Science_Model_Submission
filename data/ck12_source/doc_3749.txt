The operator is located between the promoter and the three lac operon genes.
The protein blocks the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter.
As a result, the lac genes are not expressed.
When lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator.
This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and begin transcription.
As a result, the lac genes are expressed, and lactose is digested.
Why might it be beneficial to express genes only when they are needed? (Hint: synthesizing proteins requires energy and materials.)
The parts of the lac operon: promoter, operator, lacZ, lacY, lacA, terminator
The three genes of the lac operon are lacZ, lacY, and lacA.
They encode proteins needed to digest lactose.
The genes are expressed only in the presence of lactose.
Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves an operon, such as the lac operon in E. coli .
The lac operon is regulated by proteins that behave differently depending on whether lactose is present or absent.
