Process of vesicle transport for exocytosis and endocytosis
Illustration of the two types of vesicle transport, exocytosis and endocytosis.
Endocytosis and Exocytosis
Endocytosis is the process of capturing a substance or particle from outside the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane.
The membrane folds over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the membrane.
At this point a membrane-bound sac, or vesicle, pinches off and moves the substance into the cytosol.
There are two main kinds of endocytosis:
Phagocytosis , or cellular eating, occurs when the dissolved materials enter the cell.
The plasma membrane engulfs the solid material, forming a phagocytic vesicle.
Pinocytosis , or cellular drinking, occurs when the plasma membrane folds inward to form a channel allowing dissolved substances to enter the cell, as shown in Figure below .
When the channel is closed, the liquid is encircled within a pinocytic vesicle.

Pinocytosis is a type of endocytosis.
Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as shown in Figure below .
Exocytosis occurs when a cell produces substances for export, such as a protein, or when the cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin.
Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved on top the plasma membrane by exocytosis.
