Elements in the same class share certain basic similarities.
In addition to conducting electricity, many metals have several other shared properties, including those listed below.
You can dig deeper into the properties of metals at this URL:
Metals have relatively high melting points.
This explains why all metals except for mercury are solids at room temperature.
Most metals are good conductors of heat.
Thatâ€™s why metals such as iron, copper, and aluminum are used for pots and pans.
Metals are generally shiny.
This is because they reflect much of the light that strikes them.
The mercury pictured above is very shiny.
The majority of metals are ductile.
This means that they can be pulled into long, thin shapes, like the aluminum electric wires pictured in the Figure below .
Metals tend to be malleable.
This means that they can be formed into thin sheets without breaking.
An example is aluminum foil, also pictured in the Figure below .
Both of these are aluminum metals and exhibit ductile and shiny properties
