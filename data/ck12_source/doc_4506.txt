Nerve impulses are electrical in nature.
They result from a difference in electrical charge across the plasma membrane of a neuron.
How does this difference in electrical charge come about?
The answer involves ions , which are electrically charged atoms or molecules.
When a neuron is not actively transmitting a nerve impulse, it is in a resting state, ready to transmit a nerve impulse.
During the resting state, the sodium-potassium pump maintains a difference in charge across the cell membrane (see Figure below ).
It uses energy in ATP to pump positive sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell.
As a result, the inside of the neuron is negatively charged compared to the extracellular fluid surrounding the neuron.
This is due to many more positively charged ions outside the cell compared to inside the cell.
This difference in electrical charge is called the resting potential.
Sodium Potassium pump
The sodium-potassium pump maintains the resting potential of a neuron.
A nerve impulse is a sudden reversal of the electrical charge across the membrane of a resting neuron.
The reversal of charge is called an action potential.
It begins when the neuron receives a chemical signal from another cell.
The signal causes gates in sodium ion channels to open, allowing positive sodium ions to flow back into the cell.
As a result, the inside of the cell becomes positively charged compared to the outside of the cell.
This reversal of charge ripples down the axon very rapidly as an electric current (see Figure below ).
