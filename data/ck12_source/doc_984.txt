Astronomer Johannes Kepler
suggested elliptical orbits for planets.
invented the first radio telescope.
retrograde motion:  The temporary apparent motion of a body in a direction opposite to that of the motion of most members of the solar system.
epicycles:
A construct of the geocentric model of the solar system which was necessary to explain observed retrograde motion.
Each planet rides on a small epicycle whose center in turn rides on a larger circle.
heliocentric:
The heliocentric model of astronomy is the theory that places the sun at the center of the solar system, with all the planets orbiting around it.
Big Bang theory:
A theory that deduces a cataclysmic birth of the universe from the observed expansion of the universe, cosmic background radiation, abundance of the elements, and the laws of physics.

The Life Cycle of Stars
Space may seem empty, but actually it contains thinly spread gas and dust, called  interstellar medium,  that gradually collapses over immense stretches of time and collects into denser clouds of gas and dust.
The atoms of gas are mostly hydrogen and are typically about a centimeter apart.
The dust is mostly carbon and silicon.
In some places, this interstellar medium is collected into particularly dense clouds of gas and dust known as a nebula .
