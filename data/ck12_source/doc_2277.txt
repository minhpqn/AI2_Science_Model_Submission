All the matter and energy, even space itself, came out of this explosion ( Figure above ).
What came before the Big Bang?
There is no way for scientists to know, since there is no remaining evidence.
After the Big Bang
In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the Universe was unimaginably hot and dense.
As the Universe expanded, it became less dense.
It began to cool.
After only a few seconds, protons, neutrons, and electrons could form.
After a few minutes, hydrogen came together.
There was so much energy that nuclear fusion began.
This created helium.
Clumps of matter were held together by gravity.
Eventually, these clumps formed stars.
There are now countless trillions of stars, billions of galaxies, and other structures that form the visible Universe.
The galaxies at the edge of the Universe are a great distance away.
But they are something else that is distant.
Because it takes so long for light from so far away to reach us, they are also very far back in time ( Figure below ).
Far away objects show us what the Universe was like not long after the Big Bang
Images from very far away show what the Universe was like not too long after the Big Bang.
The Big Bang hypothesis was not immediately accepted.
