Transmembrane proteins are found in all types of biological membranes.
Integral monotopic proteins are permanently attached to the membrane from only one side.
Some integral membrane proteins are responsible for cell adhesion (sticking of a cell to another cell or surface).
On the outside of cell membranes and attached to some of the proteins are carbohydrate chains that act as labels that identify the cell type.
Shown in Figure below are two different types of membrane proteins and associated molecules.
Peripheral membrane proteins are proteins that are only temporarily associated with the membrane.
They can be easily removed, which allows them to be involved in cell signaling.
Peripheral proteins can also be attached to integral membrane proteins, or they can stick into a small portion of the lipid bilayer by themselves.
Peripheral membrane proteins are often associated with ion channels and transmembrane receptors.
Most peripheral membrane proteins are hydrophilic.
Types of proteins contained in the plasma membrane
Some of the membrane proteins make up a major transport system that moves molecules and ions through the polar phospholipid bilayer.
The Fluid Mosaic Model
In 1972 S.J.
Singer and G.L.
Nicolson proposed the now widely accepted Fluid Mosaic Model of the structure of cell membranes.
The model proposes that integral membrane proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer, as seen in Figure above .
Some of these proteins extend all the way through the bilayer, and some only partially across it.
These membrane proteins act as transport proteins and receptors proteins.
Their model also proposed that the membrane behaves like a fluid, rather than a solid.
