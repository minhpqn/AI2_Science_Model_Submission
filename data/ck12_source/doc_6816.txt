Other animals, including humans, have tissue-level organization because they have tissues with specific functions.
Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more independent of each other than are the cells of other animals.
For example, some cells control the flow of water, in and out of the sponge, by increasing or decreasing the size of the pores.
Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals.
As sponges don't have mouths, they must feed by some other method.
Sponges have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn.
Cells in the sponge walls filter food from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings.
The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella, which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals.
Sponges reproduce by both asexual and sexual means.
Sponges that reproduce asexually produce buds or, more often, structures called gemmules , which are packets of several cells of various types inside a protective covering.
Freshwater sponges often produce gemmules prior to winter, which then develop into adult sponges beginning the following spring.
Most sponges that reproduce sexually are hermaphroditic and produce eggs and sperm at different times.
Sperm are frequently released into the water, where they are captured by sponges of the same species.
The sperm are then transported to eggs, fertilization occurs and the zygotes develop into larvae.
Some sponges release their larvae, where others retain them for some time.
Once the larvae are in the water, they settle and develop into juvenile sponges.
Sponges are sessile filter feeders.
Sponges lack true tissues.
