In 1964, it was first suggested that protons and neutrons do have smaller component parts, namely quarks .
The quark model was accepted very slowly because quarks had not been observed and werenâ€™t all observed until 1995.
The known quarks are divided into three families, low energy, medium energy, and high energy.
Low energy family
Low energy family
Medium energy family
Medium energy family
High energy family
High energy family
Particles that are composed of three quarks are called baryons .
The two best known baryons are protons and neutrons.
A proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark (uud).
The charge on the proton is the result of adding the charges on these quarks \left(+ \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = +1 \right) .
Neutrons are composed of one up quark and two down quarks (udd).
The charge on the neutron is the result of adding the charges on these quarks \left(+ \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 0\right) .
Everyday objects are made up of quarks from the lowest energy family, namely up and down quarks.
Quarks in the middle energy family are found in cosmic rays and are produced in particle accelerators.
Particles in the high energy family are believed to have existed briefly during the earliest moments of the Big Bang and are created only in high energy collisions.
