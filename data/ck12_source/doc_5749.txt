They also fall between metals and nonmetals in terms of their properties.
Q:
How does the position of an element in the periodic table influence its properties?
A:
Elements are arranged in the periodic table by their atomic number, which is the number of protons in their atoms.
Atoms are neutral in electric charge, so they always have the same number of electrons as protons.
It is the number of electrons in the outer energy level of atoms that determines most of the properties of elements.
Chemical Properties of Metalloids
How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in the outer energy level of their atoms.
Metalloids have from three to six electrons in their outer energy level.
Boron, pictured in the Figure below , is the only metalloid with just three electrons in its outer energy level.
It tends to act like metals by giving up its electrons in chemical reactions.
Metalloids with more than four electrons in their outer energy level (arsenic, antimony, and tellurium) tend to act like nonmetals by gaining electrons in chemical reactions.
Those with exactly four electrons in their outer energy level (silicon and germanium) may act like either metals or nonmetals, depending on the other elements in the reaction.

Physical Properties of Metalloids
Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals.
For example, metals are good conductors of both heat and electricity, whereas nonmetals generally cannot conduct heat or electricity.
And metalloids?
They fall between metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat, and if they can conduct electricity, they usually can do so only at higher temperatures.
