Each chromosome contains many genes.
Humans have about 20,000 to 22,000 genes scattered among 23 chromosomes.
Essentially, the nucleus is the control center of the cell.
The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of the genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression.
Gene expression is the process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" by various cell molecules to produce a functional gene product, such as a protein molecule or an RNA molecule.
Gene expression is a highly regulated process, ensuring RNA and proteins are only produced when necessary.
The degree of DNA coiling determines whether the chromosome strands are short and thick or long and thin.
Between cell divisions, the DNA in chromosomes is more loosely coiled and forms long thin strands called chromatin .
DNA is in this uncoiled form during the majority of the cell cycle, making the DNA available to the proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription.
Before the cell divides, the chromatin coils up more tightly and form chromosomes.
Only chromosomes stain clearly enough to be seen under a microscope.
The word chromosome comes from the Greek word chroma (color), and soma (body) due to its ability to be stained strongly by dyes.
The nuclear envelope is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material.
It separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm.
The nuclear envelope is made of two phospholipid bilayers, an inner membrane and an outer membrane.
The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope.
These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
The nucleus of many cells also contains an organelle called a nucleolus , shown in Figure below .
The nucleolus is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes.
