The Flow of Energy
Most ecosystems get their energy from the Sun.
Only producers can use sunlight to make usable energy.
Producers convert the sunlight into chemical energy or food.
Consumers get some of that energy when they eat producers.
They also pass some of the energy on to other consumers when they are eaten.
In this way, energy flows from one living thing to another.
A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem.
Pictured below is an example of a food chain ( Figure below ).
Producers form the base of all food chains.
The consumers that eat producers are called primary consumers.
The consumers that eat primary consumers are secondary consumers.
This chain can continue to multiple levels.
Example of a food chain
What do the arrows stand for in a food chain?
At each level of a food chain, a lot of energy is lost.
Only about ten percent of the energy passes to the next level.
Where does that energy go?
Some energy is given off as heat.
Some energy goes into animal wastes.
