Why do scientists say the planetary model canâ€™t be correct because the electrons would collapse into the nucleus?
If you were trying to explain the idea of quantization to younger students, do you think you should use water or money as an example?
Why?
scintillation counter:
A scintillation counter measures ionizing radiation.
The sensor, called a scintillator, consists of a transparent crystal or liquid that fluoresces (emits a flash of light) when struck by ionizing radiation.
A sensitive photomultiplier tube measures the light from the crystal and is attached to an electronic amplifier or other electronic equipment to count the signals.
alpha particles:
A positively charged particle, indistinguishable from a helium atom nucleus and consisting of two protons and two neutrons
nucleus:
The nucleus is the very dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom.
nuclear model:
The nuclear model of the atom states that the atom consists of a dense positive center called the nucleus and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons in an electron cloud.
quantization:
Quantization is the concept that a physical quantity can have only certain discrete values and intermediate values are prohibited.
The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom
Describe the quantum mechanical model of the atom.
Indicate the possible values for the  n quantum number and indicate what information the  n quantum number gives about the electron.
Indicate the possible values for the  l quantum number and indicate what information the  l quantum number gives about the electron.
Indicate the possible values for the  m quantum number and indicate what information the  m quantum number gives about the electron.
