Ocean water is slightly basic.
What might its pH value be?
Considering the properties of bases, which of the following do you think is a base?
Explain why some acids and bases are stronger than others.
Show how to use the pH scale.
Explain why pH is important to living things.
This scientist is collecting and testing samples of water from the river.
One of the properties of the water she is testing is acidity.
She wants to know how acidic the water is because water that is too acidic can harm the health of water organisms.
Strength of Acids and Bases
Acids are ionic compounds that produce positively charged hydrogen ions (H + ) when dissolved in water.
Acids taste sour and react with metals.
Bases are ionic compounds that produce negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH - ) when dissolved in water.
Bases taste bitter and do not react with metals.
Examples of acids are vinegar and battery acid.
The acid in vinegar is weak enough to safely eat on a salad.
The acid in a car battery is strong enough to eat through skin.
Examples of bases include those in antacid tablets and drain cleaner.
Bases in antacid tablets are weak enough to take for an upset stomach.
Bases in drain cleaner are strong enough to cause serious burns.
