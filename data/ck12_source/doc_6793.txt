Calculate the moment of inertia for rotation around the pivot point, which is supported by the rope with the least tension. (This will be a compound moment of inertia made of three components.)
Calculate the instantaneous angular acceleration assuming the rope of greatest tension breaks.
A horizontal beam of weight 60 \;\mathrm{N} and 1.4 \;\mathrm{m} in length has a 100 \;\mathrm{N} weight on the end.
It is supported by a cable, which is connected to the horizontal beam at an angle of 37 degrees at 1.0 \;\mathrm{m} from the wall.
Further support is provided by the wall hinge, which exerts a force of unknown direction, but which has a vertical (friction) component and a horizontal (normal) component.
Find the tension in the cable.
Find the two components of the force on the hinge (magnitude and direction).
Find the coefficient of friction of wall and hinge.
On a busy intersection a 3.00 \;\mathrm{m} beam of 150 \;\mathrm{N} is connected to a post at an angle upwards of 20.0 degrees to the horizontal.
From the beam straight down hang a 200 N sign 1.00 \;\mathrm{m} from the post and a 500\;\mathrm{N} signal light at the end of the beam.
The beam is supported by a cable, which connects to the beam 2.00 \;\mathrm{m} from the post at an angle of 45.0 degrees measured from the beam; also by the hinge to the post, which has horizontal and vertical components of unknown direction.
Find the tension in the cable.
Find the magnitude and direction of the horizontal and vertical forces on the hinge.
Find the total moment of inertia around the hinge as the axis.
Find the instantaneous angular acceleration of the beam if the cable were to break.
The medieval catapult consists of a 200 \;\mathrm{kg} beam with a heavy ballast at one end and a projectile of 75.0 \;\mathrm{kg} at the other end.
The pivot is located 0.5 \;\mathrm{m} from the ballast and a force with a downward component of 550 \;\mathrm{N} is applied by prisoners to keep it steady until the commander gives the word to release it.
The beam is 4.00 \;\mathrm{m} long and the force is applied 0.900 \;\mathrm{m} from the projectile end.
Consider the situation when the beam is perfectly horizontal.
Draw a free-body diagram labeling all torques.
