Mt.
Adams is in the background on the right. (B) The eruption of Mt.
St.
Helens blew down acres of trees like they were toothpicks.
Much of the damage in the eruption was due to pyroclastic flows.
Pyroclastic flows of pyroclasts and ash knock down everything in their path.
The temperature inside a pyroclastic flow may be as high as 1,000°C (1,800°F).
A pyroclastic flow at Montserrat volcano is seen in this video:
Lahars are mixtures of ash and water that travel down river valleys.
On Mount St.

The water mixed with ash from the eruption and created tremendous lahars.
The lahars raced down valleys and knocked out many bridges.
Mt St.
Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades.
