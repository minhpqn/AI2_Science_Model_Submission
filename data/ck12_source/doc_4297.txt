The Fierce Humboldt Squid
The Humboldt squid is a large, predatory invertebrate found in the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
A mysterious sea creature up to 7 feet long, with 10 arms, a sharp beak and a ravenous appetite, packs of fierce Humboldt Squid attack nearly everything they see, from fish to scuba divers.
Traveling in groups of 1,000 or more and swimming at speeds of more than 15 miles an hour, these animals hunt and feed together, and use jet propulsion to shoot out of the water to escape predators.
Humboldt squid live at depths of between 600 and about 2,000 feet, coming to the surface at night to feed.
They live for approximately two years and spend much of their short life in the ocean's oxygen-minimum zone, where very little other life exists.
Because they live at such depths, little is known about these mysterious sea creatures.
The Humboldt squid usually lives in the waters of the Humboldt Current, ranging from the southern tip of South America north to California, but in recent years, this squid has been found as far north as Alaska.
Marine biologists are working to discover why they have headed north from their traditional homes off South America.

Where's the Octopus?
When marine biologist Roger Hanlon captured the first scene in this video, he started screaming.
Hanlon, senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, studies camouflage in cephalopods: squid, cuttlefish and octopuses.
They are masters of optical illusion.
The video at shows some of Hanlon's top video picks of sea creatures going in and out of hiding.
