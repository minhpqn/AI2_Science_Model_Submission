Some prokaryotes form spores for survival.
Called endospores , they form inside prokaryotic cells when they are under stress.
The stress could be UV radiation, high temperatures, or harsh chemicals.
Endospores enclose the DNA and help it survive under conditions that may kill the cell.
Endospores are commonly found in soil and water.
They may survive for long periods of time.
Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells.
Prokaryotic cells have a cell wall outside their plasma membrane.
Prokaryotic DNA consists of a single loop.
Some prokaryotes also have small, circular pieces of DNA called plasmids.
