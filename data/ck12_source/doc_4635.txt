Sexual Development in Females
Female reproductive organs form before birth.
However, as in males, the organs do not mature until puberty.
Development Before Birth
Unlike males, females are not influenced by the male sex hormone testosterone during embryonic development.
This is because they lack a Y chromosome.
As a result, females do not develop male reproductive organs.
By the third month of fetal development, most of the internal female organs have formed.
Immature eggs also form in the ovary before birth.
Whereas a mature male produces sperm throughout his life, a female produces all the eggs she will ever make before birth.
