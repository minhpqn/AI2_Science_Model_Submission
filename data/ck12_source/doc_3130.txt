Q:
Where does the energy of the wind come from?
Why does air move in the atmosphere?
A:
Wind is caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere by the sun.
In other words, differences in thermal energy cause air to move in the atmosphere.
The sunlight that reaches Earth is the planet’s most important source of energy.
The energy in sunlight, called solar energy, is electromagnetic energy.
This is a form of energy that travels through space in electric and magnetic waves.
Solar energy can be used to heat homes and produce electricity in solar cells like those on the roof seen in the Figure below .
Sunny areas receive plenty of sunlight to generate electricity, but solar energy may not be practical in areas that are often cloudy.
Solar panels can generate enough electricity to power homes
Solar panels on the roof of this family home generate enough electricity to supply the family’s needs.
Q:
In addition to the roofs of homes and other buildings, where else can you find solar cells?
A:
Calculators often have solar cells.
Solar-powered outdoor lights are very common as well.
The mechanical energy of rapidly flowing water can turn a turbine and generate electricity.
Electricity produced in this way is called hydroelectric power.
