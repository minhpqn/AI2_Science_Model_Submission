This view of the Hawaiian islands shows the youngest islands in the southeast and the oldest in the northwest.
Kilauea volcano, which makes up the southeastern side of the Big Island of Hawaii, is located above the Hawaiian hotspot.
The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot.
The Hawaiian Islands formed most recently.
Kilauea volcano is currently erupting.
It is over the hotspot.
The Emperor Seamounts are so old they no longer reach above sea level.
The oldest existing of the Emperor Seamounts is about to subduct into the Aleutian trench off of Alaska.
Older ones may already be in the trench.
Geologists can get age dates from the volcanic rocks that erupt at these hotspots.
So they use hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving.
Hotspots Beneath Continents
Yellowstone Lake lies at the center of a giant caldera
Yellowstone Lake lies at the center of a giant caldera.
This hole in the ground was created by enormous eruptions at the Yellowstone hotspot.
The hotspot lies beneath Yellowstone National Park.
Hotspots are also found under the continental crust.
Since it is more difficult for magma to make it through the thick crust, they are much less common.
One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot ( Figure above ).
This hotspot is very active.
