Clastic sedimentary rocks are made of sediments.
The sediments differ in size.
Chemical sedimentary rocks are made of minerals that precipitate from saline water.
Organic sedimentary rocks are made from the bodies of organisms.
Clastic Sedimentary Rocks
Clastic sedimentary rocks are grouped by the size of the sediment they contain.
Conglomerate and breccia are made of individual stones that have been cemented together.
In conglomerate, the stones are rounded.
In breccia, the stones are angular.
Sandstone is made of sand-sized particles.
Siltstone is made of smaller particles.
Silt is smaller than sand but larger than clay.
Shale has the smallest grain size.
Shale is made mostly of clay-sized particles and hardened mud.
Silt-sized, smaller than sand
When sediments settle out of calmer water, they form horizontal layers.
One layer is deposited first, and another layer is deposited on top of it.
So each layer is younger than the layer beneath it.
When the sediments harden, the layers are preserved.
