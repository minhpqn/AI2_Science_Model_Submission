Nodes are the places where the rope doesnâ€™t move at all; antinodes occur where the motion is greatest.
For this wave, the wavelength is .
Since , the frequency of oscillation is .
Higher harmonics can also form.
Note that each end, where the rope is attached, must always be a node.
Below is an example of a rope in a 5 th harmonic standing wave.
In general, the frequency of oscillation is , where n is the number of antinodes.
The thick, dotted lines represent the wave envelope : these are the upper and lower limits to the motion of the string.
Importantly, each of the above standing wave examples can also apply to sound waves in a closed tube, electromagnetic waves in a wire or fiber optic cable, and so on.
In other words, the standing wave examples can apply to any kind of wave, as long as nodes are forced at both ends by whatever is containing/reflecting the wave back on itself.
Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when something that has a natural frequency of vibration (pendulum, guitar, glass, etc.) is shaken or pushed at a frequency that is equal to its natural frequency of vibration.
The most dramatic example is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge due to wind causing vibrations at the bridge's natural frequency.
The result is the dramatic collapse of a very large suspension bridge.
You want to create a 4th harmonic standing wave standing wave of frequency 10 Hz on a rope.
Prior to conducting your experiment, you are able to create a 1st harmonic standing wave with the exact same kind of rope at the same tension and you measure the frequency to be 3 Hz.
What length of rope will you need to use in order to create your 4th harmonic standing wave at 10 Hz?
This is a two step problem.
We'll start by finding how fast waves travel along the rope using the information from the prior test.
f_1&=\frac{nv}{2L}\\v&=\frac{f_12L}{n}\\v&=\frac{3\:\text{Hz} * 2 * 1\:\text{m}}{1}\\v&=6\text{m/s}\\
Now that we have the speed of waves on the rope, we can use that to find the length we need.
