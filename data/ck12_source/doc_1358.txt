The size of the eruptions is different at different plumes.
Hotspots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate.
They create intraplate volcanoes.
Hotspots in the Oceans
Hotspots are much more common beneath ocean crust.
This is because ocean crust is thinner.
The plume can more easily penetrate this crust.
As the tectonic plates move above a hotspot, they form a chain of volcanoes.
The islands of Hawaii formed over a hotspot in the middle of the Pacific plate.
The volcanoes are massive shield volcanoes that together create the islands.
The lavas are mafic and have low viscosity.
These lavas produce beautiful ropy flows of pƒÅhoehoe and clinkery flows of a'a.
These lava types will be described in more detail in the concept "Effusive Eruptions."
The Hawaii hotspot has been active for tens of millions of years.
The volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands formed at this hotspot.
Older volcanoes that formed at the hotspot have eroded below sea level.
These are called the Emperor Seamounts.
Loihi seamount is currently active beneath the water southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii.
One day, the volcano will rise above sea level.
Loihi will join the volcanoes of the island or create a new island ( Figure below ).
