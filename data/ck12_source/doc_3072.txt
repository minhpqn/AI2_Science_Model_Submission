Force is applied to the thick end of the wedge, and the sloping sides of the wedge apply force to the object, cutting it or splitting it apart.
A wedge makes work easier by increasing the force applied to the object, although it applies the force over a shorter distance.
This gives the wedge a mechanical advantage greater than 1.
