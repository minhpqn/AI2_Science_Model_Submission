A head and pectoral girdles (arches supporting the forelimbs) that are covered with bones derived from the skin.
A lung or swim bladder , which helps the body create a balance between sinking and floating by either filling up with or emitting gases such as oxygen.
Controlling the volume of this organ helps fish control their depth.
Jointed, segmented rods supporting the fins.
A cover over the gill called the operculum , which helps them breathe without having to swim.
The ability to see in color, unlike most other fish.
Most vertebrates are ray-finned fish, with close to 27,000 known species.
By comparison, there are "only" about 10,000 species of birds.
The ray-finned fish have fin rays, with fins supported by bony spines known as rays.
The ray-finned fish are the dominant class of vertebrates, with nearly 99% of fish falling into this category.
They live in all aquatic environments, from freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams.
The lobe-finned fish are characterized by fleshy lobed fins, as opposed to the bony fins of the ray-finned fish.
There are two types of living lobe-finned fish: the coelacanths and the lungfish.
The pectoral and pelvic fins have joints resembling those of tetrapod (four-limbed land vertebrates) limbs.
These fins evolved into legs of amphibians, the first tetrapod land vertebrates.
They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of ray-finned fish.
All lobe-finned fishes possess teeth covered with true enamel.
The lungfish also possess both gills and lungs, solidifying this class as the ancestors of amphibians.
How Big Are Bony Fish?
The ocean sunfish is the most massive bony fish in the world, up to 11 feet long and weighing up to 5,070 pounds ( Figure below ).
