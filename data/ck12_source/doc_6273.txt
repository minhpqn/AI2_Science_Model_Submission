Calculate problems 6-7 at the link below:
What is common to all the substance in the table except oxygen?
How much heat is needed to convert 2.7 moles of ethanol at its boiling point from liquid to vapor?
How many moles of water will condense from vapor to liquid if 45 Kj are removed?
molar heat of condensation (\Delta H_{\text{cond}}) :
The heat released by one mole of a substance as it is converted from a gas to a liquid.
molar heat of vaporization (\Delta H_{\text{vap}}) :
The heat absorbed by one mole of a substance as it is converted from a liquid to a gas.
Multi-Step Problems with Changes of State
Perform energy calculations involving multiple changes of state.
A large amount of heat is needed to make a substance undergo a change of state
Which takes more heat – melting or boiling?
You have a cube of ice.
Which process will take more energy – the melting of that ice cube or the conversion of the water to steam?
The short answer is that more energy is needed to convert the water to steam.
The long answer is really a question: how do you get from one point to the other?
What is the temperature of the ice?
What is the mass of that ice cube?
A lot goes into taking the material from the starting point to the end-point.
