Oxidation of 2-propanol yields acetone (propanone)
Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized in this way because the carbon to which the hydroxyl group is attached does not have another hydrogen atom attached to it.
When a primary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde, the reaction is difficult to stop because the aldehyde is easily oxidized further to the corresponding carboxylic acid.
The oxidation of ethanal produces ethanoic (acetic) acid.

Ethanol-containing beverages such as wine are susceptible to such oxidation if kept for long periods of time after having been opened and exposed to the air.
Wine that has become oxidized will have an unpleasant vinegary taste due to the production of acetic acid.
Unlike aldehydes, ketones are resistant to further oxidation because the carbonyl group is in the middle of the carbon chain and so the ketone cannot be converted to a carboxylic acid.
Oxidation reactions are described.
Examples of oxidation reactions are given.
