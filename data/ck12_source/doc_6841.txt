Therefore, they can function without gill slits.
Echinoderms also have a very simple digestive system, circulatory system, and nervous system.
The digestive system often leads directly from the mouth to the anus.
The echinoderms have an open circulatory system, meaning that fluid moves freely in the body cavity.
But echinoderms have no heart.
This may be due to their simple radial symmetry - a heart is not needed to pump the freely moving fluid.
The echinoderm nervous system is a nerve net , or interconnected neurons with no central brain.
Many echinoderms have amazing powers of regeneration.
For example, some sea stars (starfish) are capable of regenerating lost arms.
In some cases, lost arms have been observed to regenerate a second complete sea star!
Sea cucumbers often release parts of their internal organs if they perceive danger.
The released organs and tissues are then quickly regenerated.
How do Echinoderms Eat?
Feeding strategies vary greatly among the different groups of echinoderms.
There's no one food or technique that's shared by all echinoderms.
Different eating-methods include:
Passive filter-feeders, which are organisms that absorb suspended nutrients from passing water.
Some echinoderms use their long arms to capture food particles floating past in the currents.
Grazers, such as sea urchins, are organisms that feed on available plants.
Sea urchins are omnivorous, eating both plant and animals.
