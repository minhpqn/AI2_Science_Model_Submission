The tremendous energy released when the bomb explodes is incredibly destructive.
Where does all the energy come from?
The answer is the nucleus of the atom.
At the Heart of It All
The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom.
It consists of two types of subatomic particles packed tightly together.
The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge.
Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting negative particles called electrons whizzing through it.
The Figure below shows these parts of the atom.

Size and Mass of the Nucleus
The nucleus of the atom is extremely small.
Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom.
If an atom were the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a pea!

Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size.
As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom.
Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense.
If an object the size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons!
