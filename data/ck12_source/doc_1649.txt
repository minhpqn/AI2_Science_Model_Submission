This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the parental cell.
This process is called DNA replication .
The second growth phase (G2):
Proteins are synthesized that will help the cell divide.
At the end of interphase, the cell is ready to enter mitosis.
Diagram of the cell cycle
Shown is the cell cycle.
Notice that most of the cell cycle is spent in Interphase (G1, S, and G2).
Mitosis and cytokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase.
Some cells may enter a resting phase during which progression through the cycle stops.
During mitosis , the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated.
One nucleus becomes two nuclei, each with an identical set of chromosomes .
Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis , when the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two cells.
After cytokinesis, cell division is complete.
The one parent cell (the dividing cell) forms two genetically identical daughter cells (the cells that divide from the parent cell).
The term "genetically identical" means that each cell has an identical set of DNA, and this DNA is also identical to that of the parent cell.
If the cell cycle is not carefully controlled, it can cause a disease called cancer in which the cells divide out of control.
A tumor can result from this kind of growth.
The cell cycle describes the "life" of a cell.
Interphase, the stage of the cell cycle when the cell, preparing to divide, is divided into the G1, S, and G2 stages.
