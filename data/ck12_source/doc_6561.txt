Organic acids such as acetic acid all contain a functional group called a carboxyl group .
Structure of a carboxylic acid
The carboxyl group contains the C=O of the carbonyl group, with the carbon atom also being bonded to a hydroxyl (−OH) group.
A carboxylic acid is an organic compound that contains the carboxyl functional group.
The general formula for a carboxylic acid can be abbreviated as –COOH.
The carbon atom of the carboxyl group may be attached to a hydrogen atom or to a carbon chain.
The naming of a carboxylic acid is as follows:
