Because males have just one X chromosome, they have only one allele for any X-linked trait.
Therefore, a recessive X-linked allele is always expressed in males.
Because females have two X chromosomes, they have two alleles for any X-linked trait.
Therefore, they must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to express the recessive trait.
This explains why X-linked recessive traits are less common in females than males.
An example of a recessive X-linked trait is red-green color blindness .
People with this trait cannot distinguish between the colors red and green.
More than one recessive gene on the X chromosome codes for this trait, which is fairly common in males but relatively rare in females ( Figure below ).
At the following link, you can watch an animation about another X-linked recessive trait called hemophilia A:
Pedigree for color blindness
Pedigree for Color Blindness.
Color blindness is an X-linked recessive trait.
Mothers pass the recessive allele for the trait to their sons, who pass it to their daughters.
A minority of human traits are controlled by single genes with two alleles.
They have different inheritance patterns depending on whether they are controlled by autosomal or X-linked genes.
