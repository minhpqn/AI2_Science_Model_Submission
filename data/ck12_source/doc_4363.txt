Most fish are predators , but the nature of their prey and how they consume it differs from one class to another and even within classes.
Hagfish are deep-ocean bottom dwellers.
They feed on other fish, either living or dead.
They enter the body of their prey through the mouth or anus.
Then they literally eat their prey from the inside out.
Lampreys generally live in shallow ocean water or freshwater.
They either consume small invertebrates or suck blood from larger fish with their sucker mouth.
Cartilaginous fish such as sharks may live on the bottom of the ocean.
However, most live in the water column.
They prey on other fish and aquatic mammals or else consume plankton.
Bony fish may live in salt water or freshwater.
They consume a wide range of foods.
For example, they may eat algae, smaller fish, detritus, or dead organisms, depending on the species of fish.
