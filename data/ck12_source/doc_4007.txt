This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by both the viral genome and the host genome.
However, the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present come entirely from the host cell.
The influenza virus, HIV, and the varicella zoster virus ( Figure below ) are enveloped viruses.
Varicella zoster is an enveloped virus
An enveloped virus.
Varicella zoster virus causes chicken pox and shingles.
The viral envelope can give a virus some advantages over other capsid-only viruses.
For example, they have better protection from the host's immune system, enzymes and certain chemicals.
The proteins in the envelope can include glycoproteins, which act as receptor molecules.
These receptor molecules allow host cells to recognize and bind the virions, which may result in easier uptake of the virion into the cell.
Most enveloped viruses depend on their envelopes to infect cells.
However, because the envelope contains lipids, it makes the virus more susceptible to inactivation by environmental agents, such as detergents that disrupt lipids.
Viruses have different shapes.
They can be cylindrical, icosahedral, complex, or enveloped.
