A:
Photons carry electromagnetic force.
They are responsible for the force of attraction or repulsion between all electrically charged matter, including the force of attraction between negative electrons and positive protons in an atom.
Q:
Gravitons have not yet been discovered so they have only been hypothesized to exist.
What evidence do you think leads scientists to think that these hypothetical particles affect both leptons and quarks and that they carry force over all distances?
A:
Gravity is known to affect all matter that has mass, and both quarks and leptons have mass.
Gravity is also known to work over long as well as short distances.
For example, Earth’s gravity keeps you firmly planted on the ground and also keeps the moon orbiting around the planet.
The Standard Model
Based on their knowledge of subatomic particles, scientists have developed a theory called the standard model to explain all the matter in the universe and how it is held together.
The model includes only the fundamental particles in the Table above .
No other particles are needed to explain all kinds of matter.
According to the model, all known matter consists of quarks and leptons that interact by exchanging bosons, which transmit fundamental forces.
The standard model is a good theory because all of its predictions have been verified by experimental data.
However, the model doesn’t explain everything, including the force of gravity and why matter has mass.
Scientists continue to search for evidence that will allow them to explain these aspects of force and matter as well.
