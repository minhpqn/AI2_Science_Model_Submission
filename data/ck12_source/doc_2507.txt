Compare and contrast electrons and protons.
Sketch a model of a beryllium atom, which has four protons, five neutrons, and four electrons.
Your model should include the placement of electrons at the appropriate energy levels.
What are valence electrons?
Why are they so important?
How many valence electrons does a beryllium atom have (see question 3)?
Outline the search for fundamental particles.
Compare and contrast quarks, leptons, and bosons.
Relate bosons to the four fundamental forces.
Describe the standard model.
Who says scientists don’t have a sense of humor?
Look at the odd names and images in this chart.
Do you have any idea what they represent?
Would it surprise you to learn that they represent the most fundamental particles of matter?
In fact, particles with funny names like charm quarks and strange quarks make up all the matter in the universe.

The Search for Fundamental Particles
Scientists have long wanted to find the most basic building blocks of the universe.
They asked, “what are the fundamental particles of matter that cannot be subdivided into smaller, simpler particles,” and “what holds these particles together?” The quest for fundamental particles began thousands of years ago.
