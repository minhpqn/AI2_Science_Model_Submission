mass of O in 1 mol Cl 2 O 7 = 112.00 g
molar mass of Cl 2 O 7 = 182.90 g/mol
percent Cl = ? %
percent O = ? %
Calculate the percent by mass of each element by dividing the mass of that element in 1 mole of the compound by the molar mass of the compound and multiplying by 100%.
Step 2:
Calculate.
\% \ \text{Cl}&=\frac{70.90 \ \text{g Cl}}{182.90 \ \text{g}} \times 100 \%=38.76 \% \ \text{Cl} \\\% \ \text{O}&=\frac{112.00 \ \text{g O}}{182.90 \ \text{g}} \times 100 \%=61.24 \% \ \text{O} \\
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The percentages add up to 100%.
Percent composition can also be used to determine the mass of a certain element that is contained in any mass of a compound.  In the previous sample problem, it was found that the percent composition of dichlorineheptoxide is 38.76% Cl and 61.24% O.  Suppose that you needed to know the masses of chlorine and oxygen present in a 12.50 g sample of dichlorineheptoxide.  You can set up a conversion factor based on the percent by mass of each element.
12.50 \ \text{g Cl}_2 \text{O}_7 \times \frac{38.76 \ \text{g Cl}}{100 \ \text{g Cl}_2\text{O}_7}&=4.845 \ \text{g Cl} \\12.50 \ \text{g Cl}_2 \text{O}_7 \times \frac{61.24 \ \text{g O}}{100 \ \text{g Cl}_2\text{O}_7}&=7.655 \ \text{g O} \\
The sum of the two masses is 12.50 g, the mass of the sample size.
