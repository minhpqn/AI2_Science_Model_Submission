But whatever form energy takes, every single biochemical reaction in your body - and there are trillions of these reactions (or more) every split second, needs energy to start or activate.
And that is known as activation energy.
Regardless of whether reactions are exothermic reactions or endothermic reactions , they all need energy to get started.
This energy is called activation energy .
Activation energy is like the push you need to start moving down a slide.
The push gives you enough energy to start moving.
Once you start, you keep moving without being pushed again.
Activation energy is defined as the energy that must be overcome in order for a chemical reaction to occur, or the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction.
The concept of activation energy is illustrated in Figure below .

To start this reaction, a certain amount of energy is required, called the activation energy.
How much activation energy is required depends on the nature of the reaction and the conditions under which the reaction takes place.
Activation energy can be thought of as the height of the energy barrier between the reactants and the products .
Why do reactions need energy to get started?
In order for reactions to occur, three things must happen, and they all require energy:
Reactant molecules must collide.
To collide, they must move, so they need kinetic energy.
Unless reactant molecules are positioned correctly, intermolecular forces may push them apart.
To overcome these forces and move together requires more energy.
