Why is England relatively mild and rainy in winter for its latitude?
Why is central Canada, at the same latitude and during the same season, relatively dry and frigid?
Where else do you think ocean currents might moderate global climate?
What would Earth be like if ocean water did not move?
Deep Ocean Currents
Describe the processes that drive deep ocean currents.
Why do small fish live in upwelling zones?
Seawater is always on the move.
Water that comes up to the surface from deep is rich with nutrients.
Plankton gather where nutrients are plentiful.
Small fish come to eat the plankton.
Of course, larger fish and birds come to eat the smaller fish.
So upwelling is responsible for an abundance of life.
Currents also flow deep below the surface of the ocean.
Deep currents are caused by differences in density at the top and bottom.
More dense water takes up less space than less dense water.
It has the same mass but less volume.
Water that is more dense sinks.
Less dense water rises.
What can make water more dense?
