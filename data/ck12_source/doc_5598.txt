Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.
The Celsius scale of the metric system is named after Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744).
The Celsius scale sets the freezing point and boiling point of water at 0°C and 100°C respectively.
The distance between those two points is divided into 100 equal intervals, each of which is one degree.
Another term sometimes used for the Celsius scale is “centigrade” because there are 100 degrees between the freezing and boiling points of water on this scale.
However, the preferred term is “Celsius.”

The Kelvin temperature scale is named after Scottish physicist and mathematician Lord Kelvin (1824-1907).
It is based on molecular motion, with the temperature of 0 K, also known as absolute zero, being the point where all molecular motion ceases.
The freezing point of water on the Kelvin scale is 273.15 K, while the boiling point is 373.15 K.
Notice that here is no “degree” used in the temperature designation.
Unlike the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales where temperatures are referred to as “degrees F” or “degrees C,” we simply designated temperatures in the Kelvin scale as kelvins.

As can be seen by the 100 kelvin difference between the two, a change of one degree on the Celsius scale is equivalent to the change of one kelvin on the Kelvin scale.
Converting from one scale to another is easy, as you simply add or subtract 273.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter.
The Fahrenheit scale defines the freezing point of water as 32°F and the boiling point as 212°F.
