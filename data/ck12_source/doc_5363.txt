Structure of intron RNA during splicing process.
polyadenylation :
The addition of a string of adenines to the mRNAs 3â€™-end; signals the termination of translation in eukaryotes.
pre-mRNA :
Newly transcribed eukaryotic mRNA; not yet ready for translation.
spliceosome :
RNA-protein complex that usually performs splicing of the pre-mRNA.
splicing :
The process by which introns are removed from pre-mRNA.
Newly transcribed eukaryotic mRNA is not ready for translation; this mRNA requires extensive processing, including splicing and polyadenylation.
