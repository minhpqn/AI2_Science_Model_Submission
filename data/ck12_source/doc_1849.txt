To keep this from happening, people may build a series of groins.
A groin ( Figure below ) is wall of rocks or concrete.
The structure juts out into the ocean perpendicular to the shore.
A groin stops the longshore movement of sand.
Sand collects on the up-current side of the groin.
Sand on opposite of side of the groin erodes.
This reduces beach erosion.
A groin slows sand on the up-current side
This groin slows sand on the up-current side.
Can you determine which way the water is moving based on where the sand is collecting?
A seawall is also parallel to the shore.
However, a seawall is built onshore.
Seawalls ( Figure below ) protect the shore from incoming waves.

This seawall protects a shore in Vancouver.
Does Protection Work?
People do not always want to choose safe building practices, and instead choose to build a beach house right on the beach.
Protecting development from wave erosion is difficult and expensive.
Protection does not always work.
The northeastern coast of Japan was protected by anti-tsunami seawalls.
