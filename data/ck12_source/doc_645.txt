What is the pressure on the side wall of the pool at the junction with the bottom of the pool in the previous problem?
If you push the head of a nail against your skin and then push the point of the same nail against your skin with the same force, the point of the nail may pierce your skin while the head of the nail will not.
Considering that the forces are the same, what causes the difference?
A brick of gold is 10.0 cm wide, 10.0 cm high, and 20.0 cm long.
The density of gold is 19.3 g/cm 3 .
What pressure does the brick exert on the table if the brick is resting on its side?
What pressure does the brick exert on the table if it is resting on its end?
What is the total force and the pressure on the bottom of a swimming pool 8.0 m by 15.0 m whose uniform depth is 2.0 m?
fluid:
A continuous, amorphous substance whose molecules move freely past one another and that has the tendency to assume the shape of its container; a liquid or gas.
pressure:
Pressure is force per unit area.
pascal:
The pascal (symbol:
Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure,  named after the French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer, and philosopher Blaise Pascal.
It is a measure of force per unit area, defined as one newton per square meter.
State Pascal’s Principle.
Use Pascal’s Principle to make calculations on hydraulic systems.
Hydraulic car jack
A person is able to lift the entire rear end of the automobile using only one hand with the hydraulic jack shown in the image.  Hydraulic systems are similar to simple machines in that they can produce very large mechanical advantages.
