Stars that are the size of our sun fuse hydrogen much more slowly and therefore live much longer.
Medium sized stars live billions of years.
As a star begins to run low on hydrogen, since the initial quantity has been fused into the denser helium gas, the core will contract due to gravity.
The collapsing core increases temperature to the point that the star can begin to fuse helium into carbon.
When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature.
The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun.
At this point, the star is called a red giant .
If our sun became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars.
Red giants are red because the surface of the star is cooler than white or blue stars, but remain highly visible because of their gigantic size.
Relative size of a red giant
After a star becomes a red giant, it will take one of several different paths to end its life.
Which path is followed by a star after the red giant phase depends on its mass.
During the fusion life of a star, its size is the result of a competition between fusion heat pushing the material out and gravity pulling the material in.
At the end, gravity always wins.
After the star has lived through its red giant stage, the fusion essentially ends (the star runs out of fuel) allowing gravity to collapse the star.
Some of the outer layers of material will be blown away and the core becomes smaller and denser.
The core will become either a neutron star, a white dwarf, a black dwarf, or a black hole.
Low-mass stars (less than 0.5 times the mass of our sun) become a red giant and then blow off some outer material which dissipates in the interstellar medium after a few hundred thousand years.
The remainder of the star shrinks to a white dwarf.
After a few billion years, white dwarfs cool to become black dwarfs .
