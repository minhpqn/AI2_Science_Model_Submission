Satellites, Shuttles, and Space Stations

Why are satellites important?
In 1900, a category 4 hurricane devastated Galveston, Texas.
It claimed the lives of between 6,000 and 12,000 people.
By contrast, the death toll from Hurricane Katrina was about 1,800 people.
Why the difference?
Although Hurricane Katrina was a modern tragedy, it would have been much worse without the advance warning of many weather satellites.
Humans did not reach space until the second half of the 20th century.
They needed somehow to break past Earth's gravity.
A rocket moves rapidly in one direction.
