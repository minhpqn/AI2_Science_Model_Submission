A salamander!
You might have mistaken it for a lizard, but lizards are very different from salamanders.
Salamanders have moist skin, while lizards have dry scales on their skin.
Furthermore, lizards live their entire lives on land.
Salamanders must reproduce in water.
Salamanders are characterized by slender bodies, short legs, and long tails.
They are most closely related to the caecilians, little-known legless amphibians ( Figure below ).
Most of the animals in the salamander order look like a cross between a lizard and a frog.
They have moist, smooth skin like frogs and long tails like lizards.
