Acid rain is rain that has a pH less than 5 ( Figure below ).
Acidity is measured on the pH scale .
Lower numbers are more acidic, and higher numbers are less acidic (also called more alkaline ).
An acid has a pH of less than 7.
The pH of normal rain is 5.6.
It’s slightly acidic because carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in rain.
This forms carbonic acid, a weak acid.
The pH scale
This pH scale includes both normal and acid rain.

How Acid Rain Forms
Acid rain forms when nitrogen and sulfur oxides in air dissolve in rain ( Figure below ).
This forms nitric and sulfuric acids.
Both are strong acids.
Acid rain with a pH as low as 4.0 is now common in many areas.
Acid fog may be even more acidic than acid rain.
Fog with a pH as low as 1.7 has been recorded.
That’s the same pH as toilet bowl cleaner!
Nitrogen and sulfur oxides combine with rain to form acid rain
Nitrogen and sulfur oxides combine with rain to form acid rain.
