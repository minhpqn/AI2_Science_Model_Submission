You must translate.
To go from one language to another.
Spanish to English, French to German, or nucleotides to amino acids.
Which type is the translation of molecular biology?
Obviously, the type of translating discussed here translates from the language of nucleotides to the language of amino acids.
Translation is the second part of the central dogma of molecular biology:
RNA â†’ Protein .
It is the process in which the genetic code in mRNA is read, one codon at a time, to make a protein.
Figure below shows how this happens.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it moves to a ribosome , which consists of rRNA and proteins.
The ribosome reads the sequence of codons in mRNA.
Molecules of tRNA bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence.
DNA transcription to mRNA, which translates to a chain of amino acids at a ribosome
Translation of the codons in mRNA to a chain of amino acids occurs at a ribosome.
Notice the growing amino acid chain attached to the tRNAs and ribosome.
Find the different types of RNA in the diagram.
What are their roles in translation?
To understand the role of tRNA, you need to know more about its structure.
Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon for the amino acid it carries.
An anticodon is a sequence of 3 bases, and is complementary to the codon for an amino acid.
