Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity.

Q :
Newton’s law of universal gravitation had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe.
Why do you think it was so important?
A :
Newton’s law was the first scientific law that applied to the entire universe.
It explains the motion of objects not only on Earth but in outer space as well.
Factors That Influence the Strength of Gravity
Newton’s law also states that the strength of gravity between any two objects depends on two factors: the masses of the objects and the distance between them.
Objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them.
For example, because Earth is so massive, it attracts you and your desk more strongly that you and your desk attract each other.
That’s why you and the desk remain in place on the floor rather than moving toward one another.
Objects that are closer together have a stronger force of gravity between them.
For example, the moon is closer to Earth than it is to the more massive sun, so the force of gravity is greater between the moon and Earth than between the moon and the sun.
That’s why the moon circles around Earth rather than the sun.
You can see this in the Figure below .
The moon is much closer to the Earth than the sun
Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the force of gravity affects everything with mass in the universe.
