If the potential stays the same and the resistance decreases, what happens to the current?
stay the same
If the resistance stays the same and the potential increases, what happens to the current?
stay the same
How much current can be pushed through a 30.0 Ω resistor by a 12.0 V battery?
What voltage is required to push 4.00 A of current through a 32.0 Ω resistor?
If a 6.00 volt battery will produce 0.300 A of current in a circuit, what is the resistance in the circuit?
resistance:
Opposition of a circuit to the flow of electric current.
Ohm’s Law:
V = IR .
Ohms:
A resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1 volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere.
Energy Transfer in Electric Circuits
Explain how devices convert electrical energy to other forms.
Use  P = I^2R and  E = I^2Rt for calculations involves energy transfer in electrical circuits.
Describe the reason for the use of high voltage lines for transmitting electrical energy.
Define the kilowatt-hour.
Electrical transmission substation
Part of the electrical grid, an electrical transmission sub-station receives extremely high current levels, then passes the electrical energy on to as many as 200,000 homes.
