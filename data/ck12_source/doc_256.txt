What is gravity?
What caused the sun to form?
What is the relationship between the strength of a gravitational force and distance?
What is the relationship between the strength of a gravitational force and mass?
The earth is attracted to the sun by the force of gravity.
Why doesn’t the earth fall into the sun?
If the mass of the earth remained the same but the radius of the earth shrank to one-half its present distance, what would happen to the force of gravity on an object that was resting on the surface of the earth?
Lifting an object on the moon requires one-sixth the force that would be required to lift the same object on the earth because gravity on the moon is one-sixth that on earth.
What about horizontal acceleration?
If you threw a rock with enough force to accelerate it at 1.0 m/s 2 horizontally on the moon, how would the required force compare to the force necessary to accelerate the rock in the same way on the earth?
The mass of the earth is 5.98 × 10 24  kg and the mass of the moon is 7.35 × 10 22  kg.
If the distance between the earth and the moon is 384,000 km, what is the gravitational force on the moon?
gravity:
A natural phenomenon by which physical bodies appear to attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance separating them.
Learn to calculate how objects are put into orbit.
Understand why objects in orbit are weightless.
Using Newton’s Law of Gravity and the equations of uniform circular motion, solve problems involving orbital velocity and period.
The International Space Station is a man made satellite orbiting the earth
We commonly talk about satellites orbiting Earth.
But what does that really mean?
