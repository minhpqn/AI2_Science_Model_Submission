For example, the honey pictured in the Figure below is more viscous than the vinegar.

Honey and chocolate syrup
Q:
Which liquid do you think is more viscous: honey or chocolate syrup?
A:
The viscosity of honey and chocolate syrup vary by brand and other factors, but chocolate syrup generally is more viscous than honey.
A liquid is a state of matter in which particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container.
However, the particles cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container.
Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles.
Viscosity is a liquidâ€™s resistance to flowing.
Table below shows the viscosity of water at different temperatures.
Use the data in the table to answer the questions below.
The meaning of the units of viscosity is not necessary to appreciate the relationship between temperature and viscosity.
Describe in words what the data in the table show.
If you were to draw a line graph of temperature and viscosity, what would it look like?
Make a rough sketch to show how it would look. (Assume that the x-axis represents temperature and the y-axis represents viscosity.)
Write a hypothesis to explain the relationship between temperature and viscosity of water.
State the properties of matter in the liquid state.
What property of liquids explains why water beads up on the car surface pictured in the Figure below ?
