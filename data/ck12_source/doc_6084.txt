The Behavior of Gases
Give examples of the uses of compressed gases.
Compressing objects can help to squeeze them into small spaces
Will it all fit?
When we pack to go on vacation, there is always “one more” thing that we need to get in the suitcase.
Maybe it’s another bathing suit, pair of shoes, book – whatever the item, we need to get it in.
Fortunately, we can squeeze things together somewhat.
There is a little space between the folds of clothing, we can rearrange the shoes, and somehow we get that last thing in and close the suitcase.
Scuba diving is a form of underwater diving in which a diver carries his own breathing gas, usually in the form of a tank of compressed air.
The pressure in most commonly used scuba tanks ranges from 200 to 300 atmospheres.
Gases are unlike other states of matter in that a gas expands to fill the shape and volume of its container.
For this reason, gases can also be compressed so that a relatively large amount of gas can be forced into a small container.
If the air in a typical scuba tank were transferred to a container at the standard pressure of 1 atm, the volume of that container would need to be about 2500 liters.
The pressure in a scuba tank is typically 200-300 atmospheres
Compressibility is the measure of how much a given volume of matter decreases when placed under pressure.
If we put pressure on a solid or a liquid, there is essentially no change in volume.
The atoms, ions, or molecules that make up the solid or liquid are very close together.
There is no space between the individual particles, so they cannot pack together.
The kinetic-molecular theory explains why gases are more compressible than either liquids or solids.
Gases are compressible because most of the volume of a gas is composed of the large amounts of empty space between the gas particles.
