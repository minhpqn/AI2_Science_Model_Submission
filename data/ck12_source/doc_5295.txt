Of course not.
Human height exhibits a large range of phenotypes.
Normal phenotypes range from under 5 feet tall to over 7 feet tall.
How does such a wide range occur?
Well, not just from one gene.
Polygenic traits are due to the actions of more than one gene and often, their interaction with the environment.
These usually result in a measurable range in phenotype, such as height, eye color or skin color.
These are known as multifactoral or quantitative characteristics.
Polygenic inheritance results in an additive effect of the genes on a single phenotype.
Human skin color is primarily due to the presence of the pigment melanin in the skin.
Melanin is not a protein, but it is the product of a biosynthetic pathway.
Skin color is a polygenic trait and obviously demonstrates quantitative characteristics.
A number of genes factor into determining a person's natural skin color, so modifying only one of those genes changes the color only slightly.
It is currently thought that at least three separately inherited genes contribute to skin pigmentation.
Let’s call these three genes A, B, and C.
A, B, and C are incompletely dominant to a, b, and c, with A, B, and C each contributing a “unit of darkness” to the phenotype.
Therefore an AABBCC individual is very dark, darker than an AaBbCc individual, and much darker than a aabbcc individual.
A person may have as many as 6 “dark units” to as few as no “dark units,” and any combination in between.
This will result in a phenotypic spectrum of color gradation.
When graphed, a phenotypic spectrum usually results in a bell-shaped curve, with extreme phenotypes on both ends and more common phenotypes in the center of the curve.
