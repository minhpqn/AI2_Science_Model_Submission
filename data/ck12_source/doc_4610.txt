Describe the role of helper T cells.
Describe one way that cytotoxic T cells destroy cells infected with viruses.
What are regulatory T cells?
Distinguish between active and passive immunity.
Is giving shots to young children a good thing?
Many, if not most, children hated going to the doctor, as it often meant getting a shot.
Why?
The shot actually contained a weakened or dead pathogen.
And putting some of that dead pathogen into you was a good thing.
Memory B and T cells help protect the body from re-infection by pathogens that infected the body in the past.
Being able to resist a pathogen in this way is called immunity.
Immunity can be active or passive.
Active immunity results when an immune response to a pathogen produces memory cells.
As long as the memory cells survive, the pathogen will be unable to cause a serious infection in the body.
Some memory cells last for a lifetime and confer permanent immunity.
Active immunity can also result from immunization.
Immunization is the deliberate exposure of a person to a pathogen in order to provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to that pathogen.
The pathogen is often injected.
However, only part of a pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is typically used.
This causes an immune response without making the immunized person sick.
