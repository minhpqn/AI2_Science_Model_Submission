Deinonychus shared many traits with birds.
What similarities with birds to you see?
What was Deinonychus ?
Deinonychus is the genus name of an extinct dinosaur that is considered to be one of the closest non-bird relatives of modern birds.
It lived about 110 million years ago in what is now North America.
Deinonychus was a predatory carnivore with many bird-like features.
For example, it had feathers and wings.
It also had strong legs with clawed feet, similar to modern raptors.
Its respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems were similar to those of birds as well.
The location of fossilized eggs near Deinonychus fossils suggests that it may have brooded its eggs.
This would mean that it was endothermic . (Can you explain why?) On the other hand, Deinonychus retained a number of reptile-like traits, such as jaws with teeth, and hands with claws at the tips of its wings.
Evolution of Flight
Scientists have long speculated about the evolution of flight in birds.
They wonder how and why birds evolved wings from a pair of front limbs.
Several hypotheses have been suggested.
Here are just two:
Wings evolved in a bird ancestor that leapt into the air to avoid predators or to capture prey.
Therefore, wings are modified arms that helped the animal leap higher.
Wings evolved in a bird ancestor that lived in trees.
Thus, wings are modified arms that helped the animal glide from branch to branch.
