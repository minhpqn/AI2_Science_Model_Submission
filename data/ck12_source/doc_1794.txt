You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer.
The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the water.
You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly.
If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual.
Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.)
Ice wedging happens because water expands as it goes from liquid to solid.
When the temperature is warm, water works its way into cracks in rock.
When the temperature cools below freezing, the water turns to ice and expands.
The ice takes up more space.
Over time, this wedges the rock apart.
Ice wedging is very effective at weathering.
You can find large piles of broken rock at the base of a slope.
These rocks were broken up by ice wedging.
Once loose, they tumbled down the slope.
Abrasion is another type of mechanical weathering.
With abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock.
Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a slope.
Moving water causes abrasion; it moves rocks so that they bump against one another ( Figure below ).
Strong winds cause abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces.
Finally, the ice in glaciers cause abrasion.
