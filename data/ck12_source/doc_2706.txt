This performer isn’t really eating fire, but he still puts on an impressive show.
You know that fire is dangerous.
It’s hot, it can burn you, and it can easily get out of control.
But do you know what fire is?
Fire is the result of a chemical reaction.
Whenever something burns, a type of reaction called a combustion reaction occurs.
What Is a Combustion Reaction?
A combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen (O 2 ).
For example, in the Figure below , charcoal is combining with oxygen.
Combustion is commonly called burning, and the substance that burns is usually referred to as fuel.
The products of a complete combustion reaction include carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water vapor (H 2 O).
The reaction typically gives off heat and light as well.
The general equation for a complete combustion reaction is:
Fuel + O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 O
The burning of charcoal is a combustion reaction
The burning of charcoal is a combustion reaction.
Combustion of Hydrocarbons
The fuel that burns in a combustion reaction contains compounds called hydrocarbons.
Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).
The charcoal pictured in the Figure above consists of hydrocarbons.
