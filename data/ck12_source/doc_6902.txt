Sound waves are longitudinal waves.
Thus, the molecules of the medium vibrate back and forth in the same direction as the wave is traveling through.
The medium for sound is normally air for humans, but sound waves can travel in water, metal, etc. as well.
An object oscillating with frequency f will create waves which oscillate with the same frequency f .
The speed of a sound wave in air depends subtly on pressure, density, and temperature, but is about 343 m/s at room temperature.
Describe the pressure changes in the air as a sound wave passes a given point, then explain why a very loud sound can damage your tympanic membrane (ear drum).
As a sound wave passes a certain point, the air pressure at that point alternates between high and low pressure.
When sound waves pass into the ear, the alternating pressures cause a pressure difference on either side of the tympanic membrane.
The pressure differences between the inside and outside of the membrane cause the membrane to move back and forth with the same frequency as the changes in pressure.
What we perceive as very loud sounds are sound waves with very large amplitudes, meaning that the differences in pressure are very large.
The larger changes in pressure could cause damage to the membrane by causing it to vibrate too violently.

Sound (PhET Simulation)
Describe how sound is produce in a speaker, travels to your ear and how your ear converts these sound waves into sound in your brain.
The Indian instrument called a “sitar” uses two sets of strings, one above the other.
Only one set of strings is played but both make sound.
Research the sitar and explain briefly how this works.
