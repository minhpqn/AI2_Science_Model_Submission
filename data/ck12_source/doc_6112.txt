V=\frac{nRT}{P}=\frac{1.094 \text{ mol} \times 62.36 \text{ L} \cdot \text{mmHg/K} \cdot \text{mol} \times 327 \text{ K}}{728 \text{ mmHg}}=30.6 \text{ L}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The mass of ethanol is slightly more than one half mole, meaning that the mole ratio results in slightly more than one mole of carbon dioxide being produced.
Because of the elevated temperature and reduced pressure compared to STP, the resulting volume is larger than 22.4 L.
The ideal gas law is used to calculate stoichiometry problems for gases.
Solve the problems on the worksheet at this site:
Do we need gas conditions to be at STP to calculate stoichiometry problems?
Why do we want to determine the stoichiometry of these reactions?
What assumption are we making about the gases involved?
Real and Ideal Gases
Define a real gas.
Describe differences between real gases and ideal gases.
Intermolecular forces can cause deviations from ideality in gases

The behavior of a molecule depends a lot on its structure.
We can have two compounds with the same number of atoms and yet they act very differently.
Ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) is a clear liquid that has a boiling point of about 79°C.
Dimethylether (CH 3 OCH 3 ) has the same number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens, but boils at a much lower temperature (-25°C).
The difference lies in the amount of intermolecular interaction (strong H-bonds for ethanol, weak van der Waals force for the ether).
