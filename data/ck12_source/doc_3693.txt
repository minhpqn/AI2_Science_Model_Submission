Diagnosing Genetic Disorders
A genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation can be inherited.
Therefore, people with a genetic disorder in their family may be concerned about having children with the disorder.
Professionals known as genetic counselors can help them understand the risks of their children being affected.
If they decide to have children, they may be advised to have prenatal (“before birth”) testing to see if the fetus has any genetic abnormalities.
One method of prenatal testing is amniocentesis .
In this procedure, a few fetal cells are extracted from the fluid surrounding the fetus, and the fetal chromosomes are examined.
Treating Genetic Disorders
The symptoms of genetic disorders can sometimes be treated, but cures for genetic disorders are still in the early stages of development.
One potential cure that has already been used with some success is gene therapy .
This involves inserting normal genes into cells with mutant genes.
At the following link, you can watch the video ‘‘Sickle Cell Anemia:
Hope from Gene Therapy’’, to learn how scientists are trying to cure sickle-cell anemia with gene therapy.
If you could learn your risk of getting cancer or another genetic disease, would you?
Though this is a personal decision, it is a possibility.
A number of companies now makes it easy to order medical genetic tests through the Web.

Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in one or a few genes.
Other genetic disorders are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes.
