Breathing is often referred to as respiration.
When you breathe, you take oxygen into your lungs as you inhale, and you release carbon dioxide and water vapor as you exhale.
Inside all the cells of your body, a different kind of respiration takes place.
This kind of respiration is called cellular respiration.
What is Cellular Respiration?
Cellular Respiration is the process in which the cells of living things break down the organic compound glucose with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water.
The overall chemical equation for cellular respiration is:
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 â†’ 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O
As the Figure below shows, cellular respiration occurs in the cells of all kinds of organisms, including those that make their own food (autotrophs) as well as those that get their food by consuming other organisms (heterotrophs).
Cellular respiration occurs in all organisms
Q:
How is cellular respiration related to breathing?
A:
Breathing consists of inhaling and exhaling, and its purpose is to move gases into and out of the body.
Oxygen needed for cellular respiration is brought into the body with each inhalation.
Carbon dioxide and water vapor produced by cellular respiration are released from the body with each exhalation.
Energy Changes in Cellular Respiration
The reactions of cellular respiration are catabolic reactions.
In catabolic reactions, bonds are broken in larger molecules and energy is released.
In cellular respiration, bonds are broken in glucose, and this releases the chemical energy that was stored in the glucose bonds.
