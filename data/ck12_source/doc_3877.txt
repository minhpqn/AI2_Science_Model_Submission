The Water Cycle at
Give four examples of precipitation.
How does this resource define the water cycle?
What does evaporation do?
What is transpiration?
What is condensation?
What is a biogeochemical cycle?
Name an example.
Identify and define two processes by which water naturally changes from a solid or liquid to a gas.
Define exchange pool and reservoir, and identify an example of each in the water cycle.
Assume you are a molecule of water.
Describe one way you could go through the water cycle, starting as water vapor in the atmosphere.
Give an overview of the carbon cycle.
Discuss the roles of photosynthesis and cellular respiration in the carbon cycle.
Describe processes that have led to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
How could releasing this much pollution into the atmosphere not be a poor idea?
Burning of fossil fuels, such as oil, releases carbon into the atmosphere.
This carbon must be cycled - removed from the atmosphere - back into living organisms, or it stays in the atmosphere.
Increased carbon in the atmosphere contributes to the greenhouse effect on Earth.
