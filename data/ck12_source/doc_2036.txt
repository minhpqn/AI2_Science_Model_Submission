Moving onto Land
An organism that lives in water is supported by the water.
It does not need strong support structures.
It also does not need to be protected against drying out.
This is not true of land.
Moving from the seas to land required many adaptations.
Algae had covered moist land areas for millions of years.
By about 450 million years ago, plants began to appear on land.
Once there were land plants, animals had a source of food and shelter.
To move to land, animals needed strong skeletons.
They needed protection from drying out.
They needed to be able to breathe air.
Eventually they had skeletons, lungs, and the other the adaptations they needed moved onto the land.
Scale worms are an example of a fossil life from the Cambrian
Halkieria, or scale worms, are an example of a fossil life from the Cambrian.
One group of fish evolved into amphibians.
Insects and spiders were already land dwellers by the time amphibians appeared.
