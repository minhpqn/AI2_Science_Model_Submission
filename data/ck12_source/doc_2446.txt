Q:
Why does most water on Earth’s surface exist in a liquid state?
In what other states does water exist on Earth?
A:
Almost 97 percent of water on Earth’s surface is found as liquid salt water in the oceans.
The temperature over most of Earth’s surface is above the freezing point (0°C) of water, so relatively little water exists as ice.
Even near the poles, most of the water in the oceans is above the freezing point.
And in very few places on Earth’s surface do temperatures reach the boiling point (100°C) of water.
Although water exists in the atmosphere in a gaseous state, water vapor makes up less than 1 percent of Earth’s total water.
Surface Tension and Viscosity
Two unique properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity.
Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles.
Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like the water droplet that has formed on the leaky faucet pictured in the Figure below .

Viscosity is a liquid’s resistance to flowing.
You can think of it as friction between particles of liquid.
Thicker liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids.
