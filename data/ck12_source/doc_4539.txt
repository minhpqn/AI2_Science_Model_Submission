Blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart.
The right atrium pumps the blood to the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs.
Blood from the lungs enters the left atrium of the heart.
The left atrium pumps the blood to the left ventricle, which pumps it to the body.
Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle contracts without stimulation by the nervous system.
Instead, specialized cardiac muscle cells send out electrical impulses that stimulate the contractions.
As a result, the atria and ventricles normally contract with just the right timing to keep blood pumping efficiently through the heart.
You can watch an animation to see how this happens at this link:
The heart contracts rhythmically to pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.
Specialized cardiac muscle cells trigger the contractions.
