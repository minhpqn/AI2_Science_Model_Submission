Bacteria and Disease
You have ten times as many bacteria as human cells in your body.
Most of these bacteria are harmless.
However, bacteria can also cause disease.
Examples of bacterial diseases include tetanus, syphilis, and food poisoning.
Bacteria may spread directly from one person to another.
For example, they can spread through touching, coughing, or sneezing.
They may also spread via food, water, or objects.
Another way bacteria and other pathogens can spread is by vectors.
A vector is an organism that spreads pathogens from host to host.
Insects are the most common vectors of human diseases.
Figure below shows two examples.
Bacterial disease vectors include ticks and deerflies
Bacterial Disease Vectors.
Ticks spread bacteria that cause Lyme disease.
Deerflies spread bacteria that cause tularemia.
Humans have literally walked into some new bacterial diseases.
When people come into contact with wild populations, they may become part of natural cycles of disease transmission.
Consider Lyme disease.
Itâ€™s caused by bacteria that normally infect small, wild mammals, such as mice.
