Did the white-flower factor just disappear in the F1 generation?
If so, then the offspring of the F1 generation—called the F2 generation —should all have purple flowers like their parents.
To test this prediction, Mendel allowed the F1 generation plants to self-pollinate.
He was surprised by the results.
Some of the F2 generation plants had white flowers.
He studied hundreds of F2 generation plants, and for every three purple-flowered plants, there was an average of one white-flowered plant.
Law of Segregation
Mendel did the same experiment for all seven characteristics.
In each case, one value of the characteristic disappeared in the F1 plants and then showed up again in the F2 plants.
And in each case, 75 percent of F2 plants had one value of the characteristic and 25 percent had the other value.
Based on these observations, Mendel formulated his first law of inheritance.
This law is called the law of segregation .
It states that there are two factors controlling a given characteristic, one of which dominates the other, and these factors separate and go to different gametes when a parent reproduces.
Mendel first researched one characteristic at a time.
This led to his law of segregation.
This law states that each characteristic is controlled by two factors, which separate and go to different gametes when an organism reproduces.
