List three components of the dermis.
Nails and Hair
Describe the structure of hair and nails.
Explain the role of keratin.
Why do you have arm hair?
Hair covers much of our bodies.
But why?
Think of the way that you can sense something brush against your arm.
Your arm hair is important in providing this type of sensation and making you aware of your environment.
Also, hair can trap heat and keep your body warm.
Hair and Nails
Along with the skin, the integumentary system includes the nails and hair.
Both the nails and hair contain the tough protein, keratin.
The keratin forms fibers, which makes your nails and hair tough and strong.
Keratin is similar in toughness to chitin, the carbohydrate found in the exoskeleton of arthropods.
Nails are similar to claws in other animals.
They cover the tips of fingers and toes.
Fingernails and toenails both grow from nail beds.
As the nail grows, more cells are added at the nail bed.
Older cells get pushed away from the nail bed and the nail grows longer.
