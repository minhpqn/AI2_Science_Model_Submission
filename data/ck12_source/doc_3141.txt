Temperature is read off the scale at the height of the liquid in the tube.

Q:
Why does the liquid in the thermometer expand and contract when temperature changes?
A:
When the temperature is higher, particles of the liquid have greater kinetic energy, so they move about more and spread apart.
This causes the liquid to expand.
The opposite happens when the temperature is lower and particles of liquid have less kinetic energy.
The particles move less and crowd closer together, causing the liquid to contract.
The thermometer pictured in the Figure above measures temperature on two different scales:
Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F).
Although some scientists use the Celsius scale, the SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale .
If you live in the U.S., you are probably most familiar with the Fahrenheit scale.
The Table below compares all three temperature scales.
Each scale uses as reference points the freezing and boiling points of water.
Notice that temperatures on the Kelvin scale are not given in degrees (°).
Freezing Point of Water
Boiling Point of Water
Because all three temperature scales are frequently used, it’s useful to know how to convert temperatures from one scale to another.
