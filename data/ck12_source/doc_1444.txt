Is Gem really a glacier?
Glaciers as a Resource
Melting glaciers in mountain regions provide an important source of water in the summer.
Organisms and nearby human populations may depend on glacial melt water during long dry summers.
People near the Andes in South America are just some of the groups that rely on glacial meltwater in the summer.
Glaciers are ice that moves.
Continental glaciers form in a central location with ice moving outward in all directions.
Alpine glaciers form in high mountains and travel through valleys.
Ice caps cover large areas.
Because glaciers move, they have characteristic features like crevasses and bergshrunds.
