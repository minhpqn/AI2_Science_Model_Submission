Cellular Respiration at
What source of energy do cells use to build ATP by cellular respiration?
Compare the purpose and energy content of glucose to the function and energy content of ATP; in other words, why do organisms need both kinds of energy-rich molecules?
Compare the process of burning gasoline in your automobileâ€™s engine to the process of cellular respiration in terms of reactants, products, and necessary conditions.
Write out the chemical reaction which summarizes the overall process of cellular respiration, first in symbols as a chemical equation, and then in words in a complete sentence.
In what eukaryote organelle does cellular respiration take place?
Does this mean that prokaryotes cannot carry out the entire process of cellular respiration?
Explain.
Compare and contrast cellular respiration and photosynthesis.
Glycolysis - Advanced
Recognize that glycolysis is the first and most universal of three stages in cellular respiration.
Explain why biologists consider glycolysis to be one of the oldest energy production pathways.
Describe how some of the energy in glucose is transferred to ATP in the cytoplasm, without oxygen.
How do you slice a molecule of glucose in half?
With sharp knives?
Not really.
But you lyse it with enzymes during a process named glycolysis.
Glucose is sliced right in half from a 6-carbon molecule to two 3-carbon molecules.
This is the first step and an extremely important part of cellular respiration.
It happens all the time, both with and without oxygen.
