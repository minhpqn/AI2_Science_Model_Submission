This process called somatic cell nuclear transfer results in essentially a fertilized egg, a zygote produced in an artificial manner.
The resulting cell is cultivated and after a few divisions, the developing ball of cells is placed into a surrogate mother's uterus where it is allowed to develop into a fetus.
The developing fetus will be genetically identical to the donor of the original nucleus ( Figure below ).

Reproductive cloning:
The nucleus is removed from a somatic cell and fused with a denucleated egg cell.
The resulting cell may develop into a colony of cloned cells, which is placed into a surrogate mother.
In therapeutic cloning, the resulting cells are grown in tissue culture; an animal is not produced, but genetically identical cells are produced.
Risks of Cloning
Producing a cloned animal is not an insignificant achievement.
Most likely it has taken a significant effort by the group of scientists attempting to make the clone.
Rarely do scientists publish or discuss the many cloning experiments that failed, or even in the successful clones, the issues that tend to arise later, during the animal's development to adulthood.
Cloning animals shows us what might happen if we try to clone humans.
High Failure Rate
Producing a cone through somatic cell nuclear transfer is not every efficient.
The success rate ranges from 0.1 percent to 3 percent, which means that for every 1000 tries, only one to 30 clones are made.
In other words, there are 970 to 999 failures in every 1000 attempts.
That's a tremendous failure rate.
