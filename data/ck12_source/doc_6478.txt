electrode:
A conductor in a circuit that is used to carry electrons to a nonmetallic part of the circuit.
half-cell:
One part of a voltaic cell in which either the oxidation or reduction half-reaction takes place.
voltaic cell:
An electrochemical cell that uses a spontaneous redox reaction to produce electrical energy.
Define electrical potential.
Define reduction potential.
Define cell potential.
Multimeters can be used to measure voltage
How many volts is that?
The voltmeter doesn’t measure volts directly; it measures electric current flow.
But don’t worry – current flow and voltage can be directly related to one another.
The first meters were called galvanometers and they used basic laws of electricity to determine voltage.
They were heavy and hard to work with, but got the job done.
The first multimeters were developed in the 1920s, but true portability had to wait until printed circuits and transistors replaced the cumbersome wires and vacuum tubes.
Electrical potential is a measurement of the ability of a voltaic cell to produce an electric current.
Electrical potential is typically measured in volts (V).
The voltage that is produced by a given voltaic cell is the electrical potential difference between the two half-cells.
It is not possible to measure the electrical potential of an isolated half-cell.
