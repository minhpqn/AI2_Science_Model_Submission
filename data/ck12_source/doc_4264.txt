How many different types of beetles are there?
There are about 350,000 species of beetles spread all over the world.
But let's focus on this one.
Look at the detail on this Rhinoceros beetle.
The horns are used in fighting other males during mating season, and for digging.
The body of an adult rhino beetle is covered by a thick exoskeleton.
A pair of thick wings lay atop another set of wings underneath, allowing the rhinoceros beetle to fly.
Compare those evolutionary adaptations to a simple sponge, and the evolutionary significance of invertebrates becomes obvious.
Invertebrates evolved several important traits before vertebrates even appeared.
These traits are now found in just about all animals.
The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity .
