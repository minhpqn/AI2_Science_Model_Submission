The Big Idea
In the absence of a net force, objects move in a straight line.
If they turn — that is, if their velocity changes, even only in direction — there must be an applied force.
Forces which cause objects to turn around continuously in a circle are known as centripetal forces.
When an object moves in a circle its velocity at any particular instant points in a direction tangent to the circle.
The acceleration points towards the center of the circle, and so does the force acting on it.
This is only natural, when you think about it — if you feel a force pushing you towards your left as you walk forward, you will walk in a circle, always turning left.
Describe the velocity, speed and acceleration in circular motion.
Students will learn that in circular motion there is always an acceleration (and hence a force) that points to the center of the circle defined by the objects motion.
This force changes the direction of the velocity vector of the object but not the speed.
Students will also learn how to calculate that speed using the period of motion and the length of its path (circumference of the circle it traces out).
v = \frac{2 \pi r} {T}
If a particle travels a distance 2 \pi r in an amount of time T , then its speed is distance over time or \frac{2 \pi r}{T}
The Earth-Sun distance is about 1.5 \times 10^{11} \ m The Earth-Moon distance is about 3.84 \times 10^8 \ m
An orbital period, T , is the time it takes to make one complete rotation.
If a particle travels a distance 2\pi r in an amount of time T , then its speed is distance over time or 2 \pi r /T .
An object moving in a circle has an instantaneous velocity vector tangential to the circle of its path.
The force and acceleration vectors point to the center of the circle.
Net force and acceleration always have the same direction.
Centripetal acceleration is just the acceleration provided by centripetal forces.
