Venus fly trap plants use their flowers to trap insects.
The flowers secrete enzymes that digest the insects, and then they absorb the resulting nutrient molecules.
What Do Plants Need?
Plants need temperatures above freezing while they are actively growing and photosynthesizing.
They also need sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water for photosynthesis.
Like most other organisms, plants need oxygen for cellular respiration and minerals to build proteins and other organic molecules.
Most plants support themselves above the ground with stiff stems in order to get light, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.
Most plants also grow roots down into the soil to absorb water and minerals.
And, of course, we need the energy stored in plants through photosynthesis to survive.
Life as we know it would not be possible without plants.
Plants are multicellular eukaryotes.
They have organelles called chloroplasts and cell walls made of cellulose.
Plants also have specialized reproductive organs.
Almost all plants make food by photosynthesis.
