A:
This is a trick question!
The air inside each box expands to fill the available space, which is identical for both boxes.
There are more air particles in box B, but the volume of air is exactly the same in both boxes.
Pressure of Gases
Particles of gas are constantly moving in all directions at random.
As a result, they are always bumping into each other and other things.
This is modeled in the Figure below .
The force of the particles against things they bump into creates pressure.
Pressure is defined in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given area.
How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the number of gas particles in a given space and how fast they are moving.
The more gas particles there are and the faster they are moving, the greater the pressure they create.

Gas particles move randomly in all directions
The arrows show that particles of a gas move randomly in all directions.
Q:
Look at box A and box B in the previous question.
Is air pressure the same in both boxes?
Why or why not?
