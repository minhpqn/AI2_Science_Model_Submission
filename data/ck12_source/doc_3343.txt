Tiny bits of iron, called iron filings, were placed under a sheet of glass.
When the magnet was placed on the glass, it attracted the iron filings.
The pattern of the iron filings shows the lines of force that make up the magnetic field of the magnet.
The concentration of iron filings near the poles indicates that these areas exert the strongest force.
You can also see how the magnetic field affects the compasses placed above the magnet.

When two magnets are brought close together, their magnetic fields interact.
You can see how they interact in the Figure below .
The lines of force of north and south poles attract each other whereas those of two north poles repel each other.
The animations at the following URL show how magnetic field lines change as two or more magnets move in relation to each other.

A magnet is an object that attracts certain materials such as iron.
All magnets have north and south magnetic poles.
The poles are regions where the magnet is strongest.
The force that a magnet exerts is called magnetic force.
The force is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion.
A magnet can exert force over a distance because the magnet is surrounded by a magnetic field.
