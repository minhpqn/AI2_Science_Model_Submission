The transition metals also include the only elements that produce a magnetic field.
Three of them have this property: iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni).
Q:
How is the number of valence electrons typically related to the properties of elements?
A:
The number of valence electrons usually determines how reactive elements are as well as the ways in which they react with other elements.
Those Elements Down Under
Transition metals include the elements that are most often placed below the periodic table (the pink- and purple-shaded elements in the Figure above ).
Those that follow lanthanum (La) are called lanthanides.
They are all relatively reactive for transition metals.
Those that follow actinium (Ac) are called actinides.
They are all radioactive.
This means that they are unstable, so they decay into different, more stable elements.
Many of the actinides do not occur in nature but are made in laboratories.
Transition metals are all the elements in groups 3â€“12 of the periodic table.
More than half of all elements are transition metals.
Transition metals are typical metals, with properties such as a superior ability to conduct electricity and heat.
They also have the metallic properties of luster, malleability, and ductility.
In addition, transition metals have high melting and boiling points and high density.
The lanthanides and actinides are the transition metals that are usually placed below the main part of the periodic table.
