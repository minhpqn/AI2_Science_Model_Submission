No wonder it’s hard for climbers to breathe when they get close to Mount Everest’s summit!
Gas is a state of matter in which particles of matter can pull apart from each other and spread out.
As a result, a gas does not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume.
Gas particles are constantly moving and bumping into things, and this creates force.
The amount of force pushing against a given area is called pressure.
The pressure of gases in the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases rapidly as altitude increases.
Examine this sequence of photos in the Figure below , and then answer the questions below.

How does air cause this change in the balloon?
What is a gas?
Why does a gas not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume?
Explain why a gas exerts force
What does pressure measure?
Air pressure affects how high a cake rises when it bakes.
Directions for cake mixes often have special high altitude instructions, like those on the label below.
Explain why.
State properties of matter in the plasma state.
Identify where plasma is found.
