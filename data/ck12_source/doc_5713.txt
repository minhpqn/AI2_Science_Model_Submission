How is it that so many planes are able to fly without running into each other?
The flight path of a commercial airliner is carefully regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Each airplane must maintain a distance of five miles from another plane flying at the same altitude and 2,000 feet above and below another aircraft (1,000 feet if the altitude is less than 29,000 feet).
So, each aircraft only has certain positions it is allowed to maintain while it flies.
As we explore quantum mechanics, we see that electrons have similar restrictions on their locations.
We can apply our knowledge of quantum numbers to describe the arrangement of electrons for a given atom.
We do this with something called electron configurations .
They are effectively a map of the electrons for a given atom.
We look at the four quantum numbers for a given electron and then assign that electron to a specific orbital.
For any value of n , a value of  l=0 places that electron in an s orbital .
This orbital is spherical in shape:
Picture of s orbitals
From Table below we see that we can have three possible orbitals when l=1 .
These are designated as p orbitals and have dumbbell shapes.
Each of the p orbitals has a different orientation in three-dimensional space.

When l=2 ,  m_l values can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 for a total of five d orbitals .
Note that all five of the orbitals have specific three-dimensional orientations.

The most complex set of orbitals are the f orbitals .
