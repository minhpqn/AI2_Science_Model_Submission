A blocked blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart attack.
Blockage of the circulation in the brain can cause a stroke.
Ways to prevent atherosclerosis include eating healthy foods, getting plenty of exercise and not smoking.
A diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol can raise your body's cholesterol levels, which can lead to increased plaque in your arteries.
Cholesterol and saturated fat are found mostly in animal products, such as meat, eggs, milk and other dairy products.
Coronary Heart Disease
Atherosclerosis of arteries that supply the heart muscle is called coronary heart disease .
This disease may or may not have symptoms, such as chest pain.
As the disease progresses, there is an increased risk of heart attack.
A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart muscle is blocked and cardiac muscle fibers die.
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States.
The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can cause a heart attack.
The loss of oxygen to the heart muscle cause that part of the tissue to die.
Maybe one day, stem cell therapy will allow for the replacement of the dead cells with new cardiac muscle cells.
A blockage in a coronary artery stops oxygen from getting to part of the heart muscle, so areas of the heart that depend on the blood flow from the blocked artery are starved of oxygen.
Atherosclerosis in the arteries of the brain can also lead to a stroke.
A  stroke  is a loss of brain function due to a blockage of the blood supply to the brain.
Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, having a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking.
The best way to reduce the risk of stroke is to have low blood pressure.
