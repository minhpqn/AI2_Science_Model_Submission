A and B refer to two carbohydrates found on the surface of red blood cells.
There is not an O carbohydrate.
Type O red blood cells do not have either type A or B carbohydrates on their surface.
As the alleles I A and I B are dominant over i , a person who is homozygous recessive ( ii ) will not have type A or type B blood, but will have type O blood.
Homozygous dominant I A I A or heterozygous I A i have type A blood, and homozygous dominant I B I B or heterozygous I B i have type B blood.
I A I B individuals have type AB blood, because the A and B alleles are codominant.
Type A and type B parents can have a type AB child.
Type A and a type B parent can also have a child with Type O blood, if they are both heterozygous ( I B i , I A i ).
The Table below shows how the different combinations of the blood group alleles can produce the four blood groups, A, AB, B, and O.
