c = f \lambda &&  ;
Wave equation for light
c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}
When charged particles accelerate , changing electric and magnetic fields radiate outward.
The traveling electric and magnetic fields of an accelerating (often oscillating) charged particle are known as electromagnetic radiation or light.
When using the wave equation for light keep in mind that light always travels at the speed of light.
So plug in c for v in the wave equation.
The color of light that we observe is a measure of the wavelength of the light: the longer the wavelength, the redder the light.
The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation can be roughly broken into the following ranges:
10^{-11} \;\mathrm{m} and shorter
10^{-11} \;\mathrm{m} - 10^{-8} \;\mathrm{m}
10^{-8} \;\mathrm{m} - 10^{-7} \;\mathrm{m}
\sim 4\times10^{-7} \;\mathrm{m} (400 \;\mathrm{nm})^*
\sim 450 \;\mathrm{nm}
\sim 500 \;\mathrm{nm}
\sim 650 \;\mathrm{nm}
10^{-6} \;\mathrm{m} - 1 \;\mathrm{mm}
1 \;\mathrm{mm} - 10 \;\mathrm{cm}
Larger than 10 \;\mathrm{cm}
Which has a higher frequency, green light or microwaves?
