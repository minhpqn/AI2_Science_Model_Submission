Good soil is not so easy to come by.
Soil should be considered another resource that we, as a population, must strive to protect.
Soil and Water Resources
Theoretically, soil and water are renewable resources.
However, they may be ruined by careless human actions.
Soil is a mixture of eroded rock, minerals, partly decomposed organic matter, and other materials.
It is essential for plant growth, so it is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems.
Soil is important for other reasons as well.
For example, it removes toxins from water and breaks down wastes.
Although renewable, soil takes a very long time to formâ€”up to hundreds of millions of years.
So, for human purposes, soil is a nonrenewable resource.
It is also constantly depleted of nutrients through careless use, and eroded by wind and water.
For example, misuse of soil caused a huge amount of it to simply blow away in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl (see Figure below ).
Soil must be used wisely to preserve it for the future.
Conservation practices include contour plowing and terracing.
Both reduce soil erosion.
Soil also must be protected from toxic wastes.
Images of the Dust Bowl
The Dust Bowl occurred between 1933 and 1939 in Oklahoma and other southwestern U.S. states.
Plowing had exposed prairie soil.
