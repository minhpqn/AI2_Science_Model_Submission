Wave-cut cliffs form when waves erode a rocky shoreline.
They create a vertical wall of exposed rock layers.
Wave-cut platforms are level areas formed by wave erosion.
Since these platforms are above sea level, it means that either sea level was higher relative or the rock was lower.

Sea arches form when waves erode both sides of a cliff.
They create a hole in the cliff, like the one pictured below ( Figure below ).

Sea stacks form when waves erode the top of a sea arch.
This leaves behind pillars of rock.
Rivers carry sediments from the land to the sea.
Sometimes the sediments are deposited in a delta.
But if the waves are powerful, the water will transport the sediments along the coastline.
Sediments eroded from cliffs near the shoreline may also be transported.
Most waves approach the shore at an angle.
The part of the wave that is nearer the shore reaches shallow water sooner than the part that is farther out.
The shallow part of the wave "feels" the bottom first.
This slows down the inshore part of the wave and makes the wave "bend." This bending is called refraction .
