Consider the hydrogen atom.
Does the electron orbit the proton due to the force of gravity or the electric force?
Calculate both forces and compare them. (You may need to look up the properties of the hydrogen atom to complete this problem.)
Find the direction and magnitude of the force on the charge at the origin (see picture).
The object at the origin has a charge of 8 \ \mu \mathrm{C} , the object at coordinates (-2 \;\mathrm{m}, \ 0) has a charge of 12 \ \mu \mathrm{C} , and the object at coordinates (0, -4 \;\mathrm{m}) has a charge of 44 \ \mu \mathrm{C} .
All distance units are in meters.
Two pith balls of equal and like charges are repulsed from each other as shown in the figure below.
They both have a mass of 2 \;\mathrm{g} and are separated by 30^\circ .
One is hanging freely from a 0.5 \;\mathrm{m} string, while the other, also hanging from a 0.5\;\mathrm{m} string, is stuck like putty to the wall.
Draw the free body diagram for the hanging pith ball
Find the distance between the leftmost pith ball and the wall (this will involve working a geometry problem)
Find the tension in the string (Hint: use y- direction force balance)
Find the amount of charge on the pith balls (Hint: use x- direction force balance)
