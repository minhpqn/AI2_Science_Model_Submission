The most well known and medically important blood types; characteristic of all humans and many other primates; consists of four principal types:
A, B, AB, and O.
codominance :
Occurs when both traits appear in a heterozygous individual.
incomplete dominance :
Occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele is not present.
multiple alleles :
When three or more alleles determine a trait, such as with the human ABO blood group.
polygenic trait :
Traits that are due to the actions of more than one gene; often also involves interactions with the environment.
The Mendelian pattern of inheritance and expression does not apply to all traits.
Codominant traits, incompletely dominant traits, and polygenic traits do not follow simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance.
Their inheritance patterns are more complex.
