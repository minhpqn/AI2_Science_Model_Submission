Is there a carrying capacity for the human population?
How quickly is the human population growing?
If we look at worldwide human population growth from 10,000 BCE through today, our growth looks like exponential growth .
It increased very slowly at first, but later grew faster and faster as the population increased in size ( Figure below ).
And recently, the human population has increased at a faster pace than ever before.
It has taken only 12 years for the world's population to increase from six billion to seven billion.
Considering that in the year 1804, there were just one billion people, and in 1927, there were just two billion people (that's 123 years to increase from 1 to 2 billion), the recent increase in the human population growth rate is characteristic of exponential growth.
Does this mean there are unlimited resources?
The human population has grown exponentially over the centuries
Worldwide human population growth from 10,000 BCE through today.
On the other hand, if you look at human population growth in specific countries, you may see a different pattern.
On the level of a country, the history of human population growth can be divided into five stages, as described in Table below .
Some countries have very high birth rates, in some countries the growth rate has stabilized, and in some countries the growth rate is in decline.
Birth and death rates are high and population growth is stable.
This occurred in early human history.
Significant drop in death rate, resulting in exponential growth.
This occurred in 18th- and 19th-century Europe.
Population size continues to grow.
Birth rates equal death rates and populations become stable.
Total population size may level off.
