Collision Lab (PhET Simulation)
You are playing pool and you hit the cue ball with a speed of 2\;\mathrm{m/s} at the 8 -ball (which is stationary).
Assume an elastic collision and that both balls are the same mass.
Find the speed and direction of both balls after the collision, assuming neither flies off at any angle.
A 0.045\;\mathrm{kg} golf ball with a speed of 42.0\;\mathrm{m/s} collides elastically head-on with a 0.17\;\mathrm{kg} pool ball at rest.
Find the speed and direction of both balls after the collision.
Ball A is traveling along a flat table with a speed of 5.0\;\mathrm{m/s} , as shown below.
Ball B , which has the same mass, is initially at rest, but is knocked off the table in an elastic collision with Ball A .
Find the horizontal distance that Ball B travels before hitting the floor.
Students are doing an experiment on the lab table.
A steel ball is rolled down a small ramp and allowed to hit the floor.
Its impact point is carefully marked.
Next a second ball of the same mass is put upon a set screw and a collision takes place such that both balls go off at an angle and hit the floor.
All measurements are taken with a meter stick on the floor with a co-ordinate system such that just below the impact point is the origin.
The following data is collected:
no collision: 41.2 \;\mathrm{cm}
target ball: 37.3 \;\mathrm{cm} in the direction of motion and 14.1 \;\mathrm{cm} perpendicular to the direction of motion
From this data predict the impact position of the other ball.
One of the lab groups declares that the data on the floor alone demonstrate to a 2 % accuracy that the collision was elastic.
Show their reasoning.
