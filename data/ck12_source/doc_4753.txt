What is a cell?
Unifying Principles of Biology - Advanced
Identify and explain the four unifying principles of modern biology.
Briefly explain the cell theory and the gene theory.
Define evolution and natural selection.
What is a biological principle?
The word principle can be defined as "a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning." A principle of biology is a fundamental concept that is just as true for a bee or a sunflower as it is for us.
All life, including that sunflower and bee, is made of at least one cell.
The traits of a particular organism are embedded within its genes, that organism must maintain homeostasis to survive, and that organism has evolved from previously existing species.
Unifying Principles of Biology
There are four unifying principles of biology that are important to all life and form the foundation of modern biology.
These are:
the cell theory,
the gene theory,
The Cell Theory
The cell is the basic unit of structure and function of all organisms.
The Cell Theory states that all living things are made of one or more cells, or the secretions of those cells, such as the organisms shown in Figure below .
For example, shell and bone are built by cells from substances that they secrete into their surroundings.
Cells come from cells that already exist, that is, they do not suddenly appear from nowhere.
In organisms that are made of many cells (called multicellular organisms), every cell in the organism's body derives from the single cell that results from a fertilized egg.
