Their niches were taken over by sauropsids .
These were the amniotes that evolved into dinosaurs, reptiles, and birds.
Not all therapsids went extinct, however.
The few that remained no longer had to compete with many other therapsids.
Some of them eventually evolved into mammals.
The surviving therapsids were small animals.
Some of the most successful were the cynodonts (see Figure below ).
They flourished worldwide during the first half of the Triassic Period.
Some of them ate insects and were nocturnal , or active at night.
Being nocturnal may have helped save them from extinction.
Why?
A nocturnal niche was one of the few niches that dinosaurs did not take over in the Triassic Period.
Cynodonts became more mammal-like as they continued to evolve.
Some of their mammalian traits may have been adaptations to their nocturnal niche.
For example:
The ability to regulate body temperature might have been selected for because it would allow nocturnal animals to remain active in the cool of the night.
A good sense of hearing might have been selected for because it would be more useful than good vision when hunting in the dark.
