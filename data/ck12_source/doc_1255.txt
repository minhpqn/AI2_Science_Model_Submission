World War II allowed scientists to make some puzzling observations.
The observations came from seafloor bathymetry and magnetism.
These observations are:
The seafloor has a large mountain range running through it.
Deep trenches are found far from the ridges.
Guyots have eroded tops that are deep below sea level.
The magnetic polarity of the seafloor changes.
The center of the ridge is of normal polarity.
Stripes of normal and reverse polarity are found symmetrical on both sides of the ridge.
The youngest seafloor is at the ridge.
The oldest is farthest from the ridge.
The oldest seafloor is much younger than the oldest continent.
Scientists needed to explain these observations.
Not long after Wegener's death, scientists recognized that there is convection in the mantle.
Deeper material is hotter and so it rises.
Near the surface, it becomes cooler and denser so it sinks.
This creates a convection cell in the mantle.
After the war, Harry Hess put together the ideas and evidence he needed.
Hess resurrected Wegener's continental drift hypothesis.
He reviewed the mantle convection idea.
