And any change to a stop codon will extend translation until the next in-frame stop codon.
Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence.
In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations.
Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious.
These mutations can be passed to the next generation.
If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation.
If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease.
Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring).
Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell.
If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect.
On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.
Mutations and Evolution
A gene pool is the complete set of unique alleles in a species or population.
Mutations create variation in the gene pool.
Populations with a large gene pool are said to be genetically diverse and very robust.
They are able to survive intense times of natural selection against certain phenotypes.
During these times of selection, individuals with less favorable phenotypes resulting from deleterious alleles (due to mutations) may be selected against and removed from the population.
Concurrently, the more favorable mutations that cause beneficial or advantageous phenotypes tend to accumulate in that population, resulting, over time, in evolution.
In fact, without any change in the gene pool, without any new alleles added due to new mutations, evolution could not occur.
Genetic change is the driving force of evolution.
