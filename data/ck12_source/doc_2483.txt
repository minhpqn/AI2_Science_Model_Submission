Explain why the pressure of a gas increases when its volume decreases.
Imagine blowing up a latex balloon.
Assume that you tie the balloon to prevent air from escaping and then squeeze the balloon with one hand, so there is less space inside it.
Then assume you use both hands (and maybe a friend’s hands) to squeeze the balloon so there is even less space inside.
What do you think will happen to the balloon if you keep squeezing it to a smaller and smaller volume?
Explain your prediction.
Describe how the volume of a gas is related to its temperature.
Explain what happens to gas particles when they are heated.
In the 1700s and 1800s, hot air balloons were very popular.
Why wouldn’t they be?
Riding in a hot air balloon allowed people to travel through the air and get a bird’s eye view of the landscape at a time when airplanes did not yet exist.
Do you know why hot air can inflate a balloon?

Up, Up, and Away
The popularity of hot air balloons got scientists thinking about gases and what happens to them when they heat up.
In the early 1800s, two French scientists—Jacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussac—decided to investigate how changes in the temperature of a gas affect the amount of space it takes up, or its volume.
They heated air and measured how its volume changed.
The two scientists already knew that the pressure of a gas affects it volume.
This had been demonstrated back in the 1660s by the English scientist Robert Boyle.
So Charles and Gay-Lussac controlled the effects of pressure by keeping it constant in their experiments.
