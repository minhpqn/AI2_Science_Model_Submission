Within the epidermis, thousands of pairs of bean-shaped schlerenchymal guard cells swell and shrink by osmosis to open and close stomata , tiny pores which control the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases and the release of water vapor.
The lower surfaces of some leaves contain as many as 100,000 stomata per square centimeter.

The epidermis of Arabidopsis shows both pavement cells (A) and stomata made of sclerenchymal guard cells (B), which control water loss and gas exchange.
Ground tissue makes up much of the interior of a plant and carries out basic metabolic functions.
Ground tissue in stems provides support and may store food or water.
Ground tissues in roots may also store food.
Vascular tissue runs through the ground tissue inside a plant.
Your body was able to grow from a single cell to perhaps 100 trillion cells because, 21 days after fertilization, a tiny heart began to pump blood throughout your tiny self – and it hasn’t stopped since.
The blood it pumps carries water, oxygen and nutrients to each one of your trillions of cells, and removes CO 2 and other wastes.
Of course plants don’t have hearts, but they do have vessels that transport water, minerals, and nutrients through the plant.
These vessels are the vascular tissue, and consist of xylem and phloem .
Xylem and phloem are packaged together in bundles, as shown in Figure below .

Bundles of xylem and phloem run through the ground tissue inside this stalk of celery.
What function do these tissues serve?
The three types of plant cells are found in each of the major types of plant tissues: dermal, ground, and vascular tissues.
Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis.
It mediates most of the interactions between a plant and its environment.
Ground tissue makes up most of the interior of a plant.
