Voyager 2 followed in These probes sent back detailed pictures of Saturn, its rings, and some of its moons ( Figure below ).
From the Voyager data, we learned what Saturn’s rings are made of.
They are particles of water and ice with a little bit of dust.
There are several gaps in the rings.
These gaps were cleared out by moons within the rings.
Gravity attracts dust and gas to the moon from the ring.
This leaves a gap in the rings.
Other gaps in the rings are caused by the competing forces of Saturn and its moons outside the rings.

The rings of Saturn.
Scientists think that there are two possibilities for how Saturn's rings formed.
One possibility is by the breakup of one of Saturn’s moons.
The other possibility is from material that never made it into the planet when Saturn originally formed.
An animation of dark spokes in Saturn’s rings is seen here:

The spokes appear seasonally and their origin is as yet unknown.
As of 2012, 62 natural moons have been identified around Saturn.
Only seven of Saturn’s moons are round.
All but one is smaller than Earth’s moon.
Some of the very small moons are found within the rings.
