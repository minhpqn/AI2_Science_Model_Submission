On the other hand, if the same results are obtained, scientists can place more confidence in them.
How Scientists Communicate
The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that scientists may communicate about their research.
Some of the most common ways scientists communicate are listed below.
Scientists may present papers about their research at scientific conferences.
This is a good way to quickly reach an audience of other scientists who are most interested in the research topic.
Scientists may publish articles about their research in peer-reviewed science journals.
Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers, in other words, by other scientists.
The articles are published only if the other scientists are convinced that the research is accurate and honest.
Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their findings relate to matters of public policy, such as environmental pollution.
Scientists may communicate about their research to the general public.
For example, they might create a Web site about their research, blog about it, or write articles for newspapers or magazines.
Q:
Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about their research to the general public?
Give an example.
A:
Communicating to the general public might be important if the research is directly related to peopleâ€™s lives.
For example, assume that a scientist has investigated how driving habits are related to car crashes.
She might write a newspaper article to share the research results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the risk of crashes.
The last step of most scientific investigations is communicating the results of the research.
