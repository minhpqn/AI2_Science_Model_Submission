For a given capacitor, the amount of charge, Q , acquired by each plate is proportional to the potential difference, V .
Q is the charge in coulombs, V is the voltage in volts, and C is the particular capacitor’s constant of proportionality.
C is also called the capacitance of the capacitor.
The capacitance is the voltage the capacitor can reach before it discharges, allowing the voltage across the capacitor to drop to zero and the current to cross the capacitor.
The SI unit for capacitance, according to the equation above, will be coulombs/volt, and this unit has been given the name farad (F).
Most capacitors have capacitances in the range of one picofarad (10 -12 F) to one microfarad (10 -6 F).
Example Problem:
A sphere has a potential difference between it and the earth of 60.0 V when charged with 3.0×10 -6 C.
What is the capacitance?
Solution:
C=\frac{Q}{V}=\frac{3.0 \times 10^{-6} \text{ coulombs}}{60.0 \text{ volts}}=5.0 \times 10^{-8} \text{ farads}
Since electrons repel each other, when excess electrons are placed on a conductor, they will move to positions as far away from each other as possible.
When a charged conductor is touched to an uncharged conductor, the electrons will migrate until the density of the charge becomes evenly distributed over the entire surface.
Touching a charged object to the earth is called grounding.
A charged conducting sphere will always have all the excess charge on its surface.
A typical capacitor consists of a pair of parallel plates, separated by a small distance.
Q = CV , where Q is the charge in coulombs,  V is the voltage in volts, and  C is the constant of proportionality, or capacitance.
