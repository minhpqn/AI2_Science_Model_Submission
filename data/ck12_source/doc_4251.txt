A female bowerbird inspects the nests of many males before choosing as a mate the male with the best nest.
In most species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles, parents provide no care to their offspring.
In birds and mammals, on the other hand, parental care is common.
Most often, the mother provides the care.
However, in some species, both parents or just the father may be involved.
Parental care is generally longest and most involved in mammals.
Besides feeding and protecting their offspring, parents may teach their offspring skills they will need to survive on their own.
For example, meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat scorpions.
They show the pups how to safely handle the poisonous insects and how to remove the stingers.

Some species of animals are territorial .
This means that they defend their area.
The area they defend usually contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring.
A species is more likely to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area.
Animals generally do not defend their territory by fighting.
Instead, they are more likely to use display behavior.
