Bending Light (PhET Simulation)
Using the Table ( below ), which states the indices of refraction for a number of materials, answer the following questions:
For which of these materials is the speed of light slowest ?
Which two materials have the most similar indices of refraction?
What is the speed of light in cooking oil?
heavy flint glass
A certain light wave has a frequency of 4.29 \times 10^{14} \;\mathrm{Hz} .
What is the wavelength of this wave in empty space?
In water?
A light ray bounces off a fish in your aquarium.
It travels through the water, into the glass side of the aquarium, and then into air.
Draw a sketch of the situation, being careful to indicate how the light will change directions when it refracts at each interface.
Include a brief discussion of why this occurs.
A light ray goes from the air into the water.
If the angle of incidence is 34^\circ , what is the angle of refraction?
Nisha stands at the edge of an aquarium 3.0 \;\mathrm{m} deep.
She shines a laser at a height of 1.7 \;\mathrm{m} that hits the water of the pool 8.1 \;\mathrm{m} from the edge.
Draw a diagram of this situation.
Label all known lengths.
How far from the edge of the pool will the light hit bottom?
