The other light bulbs produce light by some type of luminescence, in which light is produced without heat.
These light bulbs use energy more efficiently.
Which types of light bulbs do you use?
Most artificial lights use electricity for energy and have a light bulb that changes the electrical energy to visible light.
The production of visible light can happen in various ways, depending on the type of bulb.
Types of light bulbs include incandescent, fluorescent, neon, vapor, and LED bulbs.
They produce light in different ways and have different uses.
Incandescent lights use heat to produce visible light, so they are not as energy efficient as the other types of lights.
