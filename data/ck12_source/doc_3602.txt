Cell Division in Eukaryotes
Cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes.
Prior to dividing, all the DNA in a eukaryotic cellâ€™s multiple chromosomes is replicated.
Its organelles are also duplicated.
Then, when the cell divides, it occurs in two major steps:
The first step is mitosis , a multi-phase process in which the nucleus of the cell divides.
During mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down and later reforms.
The chromosomes are also sorted and separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives a diploid number (2 sets) of chromosomes.
In humans, that number of chromosomes is 46 (23 pairs).
Mitosis is described in greater detail in a subsequent concept.
The second major step is cytokinesis.
As in prokaryotic cells, the cytoplasm must divide.
Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.
Cell division is part of the life cycle of virtually all cells.
Cell division is the process in which one cell divides to form two new cells.
Most prokaryotic cells divide by the process of binary fission.
In eukaryotes, cell division occurs in two major steps: mitosis and cytokinesis.
