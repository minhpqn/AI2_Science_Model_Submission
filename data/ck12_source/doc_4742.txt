Laminar Flow Cabinet :
A carefully enclosed bench designed to prevent contamination of biological samples.
Air is drawn through a fine filter and blown in a very smooth, laminar (streamlined) flow towards the user.
The cabinet is usually made of stainless steel with no gaps or joints where microorganisms might collect.
Gloves :
Due to possible allergic reactions to latex, latex gloves are not recommended for lab use.
Instead, vinyl or nitrile gloves, shown in Figure below , are often used.
Gloves protect the wearers hands and skin from getting contaminated by microorganisms or stained or irritated by chemicals.
A nitrile glove.
Latex gloves are no longer recommended so vinyl gloves or nitrile gloves, which are usually green or blue in color, are preferred.
Lab Coat :
A knee-length overcoat is usually worn while working in the lab.
The coat helps to protect the researcherâ€™s clothes from splashes or contamination.
The garment is made from white cotton or linen to allow it to be washed at high temperatures and to make it easy to see if it is clean.
Safe Laboratory Practice
Safety precautions are in place to help prevent accidents.
Always wear personal protective equipment such as goggles and gloves when recommended to do so by your teacher.
Tell your teacher immediately if an accident happens.
