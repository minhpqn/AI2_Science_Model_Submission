An example of positive feedback is milk production in nursing mothers.
As the baby drinks her mother's milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released.
The more the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk to be produced.
Other examples of positive feedback include contractions during childbirth.
When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the birth canal, additional contractions occur.
Homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing external environment.
Homeostasis is maintained primarily through negative feedback, when a response to a stimulus keeps a variable close to a set value.
