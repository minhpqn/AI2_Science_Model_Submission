This is a group of 16 small volcanic islands 966 kilometers (600 miles) off the west coast of Ecuador, South America.
Map of the Galapagos
Galápagos Islands.
This map shows the location of the Galápagos Islands that Darwin visited on his voyage.
Individual Galápagos islands differ from one another in important ways.
Some are rocky and dry.
Others have better soil and more rainfall.
Darwin noticed that the plants and animals on the different islands also differed.
For example, the giant tortoises on one island had saddle-shaped shells, while those on another island had dome-shaped shells (see Figure below ).
People who lived on the islands could even tell the island a turtle came from by its shell.
This started Darwin thinking about the origin of species.
He wondered how each island came to have its own type of tortoise.
Galápagos Tortoises.
Galápagos tortoises have differently shaped shells depending on which island they inhabit.
Tortoises with saddle-shaped shells can reach up to eat plant leaves above their head.
Tortoises with dome-shaped shells cannot reach up in this way.
These two types of tortoises live on islands with different environments and food sources.
How might this explain the differences in their shells?
The Farallon Islands – "California's Galapagos"
One of the most productive marine food webs on the planet is located on the Farallon Islands, just 28 miles off the San Francisco, California coast.
