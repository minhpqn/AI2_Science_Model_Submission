Use Hess’s law of heat summation to add chemical reactions together in such a way as to produce a desired final equation.
Calculate the enthalpy change for that final reaction.
The heat generated by an acetylene torch is best calculated using Hess's Law
How much energy is involved in the operation of an acetylene torch?
Since there is a complex series of reactions taking place, simple methods for determining the heat of reaction will not work.
We need to develop new approaches to these calculations.
Adding Heats of Reaction
It is sometimes very difficult or even impossible to measure the enthalpy change for a reaction directly in the laboratory.
Some reactions take place extremely slowly, making a direct measurement unfeasible.
In other cases, a given reaction may be an intermediate step in a series of reactions.
Some reactions may be difficult to isolate because multiple side reactions may occur at the same time.
Fortunately, it is possible to measure the enthalpy change for a reaction by an indirect method.
Hess’s law of heat summation states that if two or more thermochemical equations can be added together to give a final equation, then the heats of reaction can also be added to give a heat of reaction for the final equation.
An example will illustrate how Hess’s law can be used.
Acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) is a gas that burns at an extremely high temperature (3300°C) and is used in welding (pictured in the opening image).
On paper, acetylene gas can be produced by the reaction of solid carbon (graphite) with hydrogen gas.
2\text{C}(s, \ \text{graphite})+\text{H}_2(g)\rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2(g) \qquad \triangle \text{H}=?
Unfortunately, this reaction would be virtually impossible to perform in the laboratory because carbon would react with hydrogen to form many different hydrocarbon products simultaneously.
There is no way to create conditions under which only acetylene would be produced.
However, enthalpy changes for combustion reactions are relatively easy to measure.
