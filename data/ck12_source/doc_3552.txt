What happens after the pump is phosphorylated?
What happens after dephosphorylation?
What is active transport?
What type of protein is involved in active transport?
Describe how the sodium-potassium pump functions.
What is the electrochemical gradient?
Exocytosis and Endocytosis
Define vesicle transport.
Describe endocytosis and exocytosis.
Distinguish phagocytosis from pinocytosis.
What does a cell "eat"?
Is it possible for objects larger than a small molecule to be engulfed by a cell?
Of course it is.
This image depicts a cancer cell being attacked by a cell of the immune system.
Cells of the immune system consistently destroy pathogens by essentially "eating" them.
Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass through the plasma membrane or to move through a transport protein.
So cells use two other active transport processes to move these macromolecules (large molecules) into or out of the cell.
Vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm move macromolecules or large particles across the plasma membrane.
There are two types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and exocytosis (illustrated in Figure below ).
Both processes are active transport processes, requiring energy.
