Hawks eat snakes
Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level.
Humans, for example, are primary consumers when they eat plants such as vegetables.
They are secondary consumers when they eat cows.
They are tertiary consumers when they eat salmon.
Trophic Levels and Energy
Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels.
However, generally only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is available to the next level.
This is represented by the ecological pyramid in Figure below .
What happens to the other 90 percent of energy?
It is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat.
This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web.
Sometimes there may be a fifth trophic level, but usually thereâ€™s not enough energy left to support any additional levels.
An example of an ecological pyramid
Ecological Pyramid.
This pyramid shows how energy and biomass decrease from lower to higher trophic levels.
Assume that producers in this pyramid have 1,000,000 kilocalories of energy.
How much energy is available to primary consumers?
Ecological pyramids can demonstrate the decrease in energy, biomass or numbers within an ecosystem.
