Which part of a computer allows the CPU and RAM to communicate?
Define magnet and magnetic pole.
Describe magnetic force and relate it to magnetic field.
The train in this photo is called a maglev train.
The word maglev stands for “magnetic levitation.” Magnets push the train upward so it hovers, or levitates, above the track without actually touching it.
This eliminates most of the friction acting against the train when it moves.
Other magnets pull the train forward along the track.
Because of all the magnets, the train can go very fast.
It can fly over the tracks at speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour!
What are magnets and how do they exert such force?
