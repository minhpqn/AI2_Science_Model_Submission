The only exception is helium, which has just two electrons.
But helium also has a full outer energy level, because its only energy level (energy level 1) can hold a maximum of two electrons.
A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
As a result, noble gases cannot become more stable by reacting with other elements and gaining or losing valence electrons.
Therefore, noble gases are rarely involved in chemical reactions and almost never form compounds with other elements.
Noble Gases and the Octet Rule
Because the noble gases are the least reactive of all elements, their eight valence electrons are used as the standard for nonreactivity and to explain how other elements interact.
This is stated as the octet (“group of eight”) rule.
According to this rule, atoms react to form compounds that allow them to have a group of eight valence electrons like the noble gases.
For example, sodium (with one valence electron) reacts with chlorine (with seven valence electrons) to form the stable compound sodium chloride (table salt).
In this reaction, sodium donates an electron and chlorine accepts it, giving each element an octet of valence electrons.
Some Uses of Noble Gases
Did you ever get helium balloons like those in the opening picture?
Unlike a balloon filled with air, a balloon filled with helium needs to be weighted down so it won’t float away — although you don’t have to use an elephant!.
Q:
Why does a helium balloon float away if it’s not weighted down?
A:
Helium atoms have just two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, so they have less mass than any other atoms except hydrogen.
As a result, helium is lighter than air, explaining why a helium balloon floats up into the air unless weighted down.
Early incandescent light bulbs, like the one pictured in the Figure below , didn’t last very long.
