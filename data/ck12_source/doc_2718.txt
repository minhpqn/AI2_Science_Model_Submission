What is the exothermic reaction in the video?
What role does the flame play in this reaction?
The exothermic reaction releases energy.
What is this energy used for?
What is the endothermic reaction in the video?
What provides the activation energy for this reaction?
What product results from this reaction?
What is activation energy?
Why do reactants need energy in order for a chemical reaction to begin?
Make an original graph to represent the role of energy, including activation energy, in an endothermic reaction.
Chemical Reaction Rate
Define chemical reaction rate.
Identify factors that influence the rate of chemical reactions.
Sodium reacts violently with water.
That’s what is happening in the picture above.
Why does sodium have such explosive reactions?
It’s because the reactions occur so quickly.
