These animals don't fly or even move much at all.
They usually cling to rocks, using a root-like structure.
Types of Echinoderms
The echinoderms can be divided into two major groups:
Eleutherozoa are the echinoderms that can move.
This group includes the starfish and most other echinoderms.
Pelmatozoa are the immobile echinoderms.
This group includes crinoids , such as the feather stars .
Listed below are the four main classes of echinoderms present in the Eleutherozoa Group ( Table below ).
Starfish and asteroids
Capture prey for their own food.
Brittle stars ( Figure below )
Bottom feeders with long, narrow, flexible arms that allow relatively fast movement.
Sea urchins and sand dollars
Have movable spines which are used for movement, defense, and sensing the environment.
Armless, elongated, generally soft-bodied animals.

Echinoderms are spread all over the world at almost all depths, latitudes, and environments in the ocean.
Most feather stars (crinoids) live in shallow water.
