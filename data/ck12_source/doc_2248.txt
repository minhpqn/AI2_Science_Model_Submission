Our Sun is a fairly common type of star and has an average lifespan.
Red giants are what some main sequence stars (like our Sun) become near the end of their lives.
They are much larger than our Sun.
Supergiants are very massive stars and are larger than our Sun, but have a smaller radius than red giants.
Supergiants have very short lifetimes.
Stars are classified by color, which correlates with temperature.
Red stars are the coolest and blue are the hottest.
Stars are plotted on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
Star temperatures are found in a continuum ranging from 2000 K to more than 30,000 K.
Kelvin is a temperature measure in which the lowest temperature is absolute zero.
