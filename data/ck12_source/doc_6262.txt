The enthalpy change is negative because the reaction releases heat to the surroundings, resulting in an increase in temperature of the water.
The process of calorimetry is described.
Calculations involving enthalpy changes are illustrated.

What kinds of reactions are usually analyzed in a calorimeter?
What is a constant-pressure calorimeter?
Why are foam cups used in a calorimeter?
calorimeter:
An insulated container that is used to measure heat changes.
calorimetry:
The measurement of the transfer of heat into or out of a system during a chemical reaction or physical process.
Define thermochemical equation.
Define heat of reaction.
The energy released from burning a fuel needs to be considered when choosing between different fuels
What is the best way to heat a house?
Heating a home is becoming more and more expensive.
Do we use gas, oil, electricity, wood?
Part of the decision is based on which fuel will provide the highest amount of energy release when burned.
Studies of thermochemistry can be very useful in getting reliable information for making these important choices.
When methane gas is combusted, heat is released, making the reaction exothermic.
