Glaciers cause erosion in two main ways: plucking and abrasion.
Plucking is the process by which rocks and other sediments are picked up by a glacier.
They freeze to the bottom of the glacier and are carried away by the flowing ice.
Abrasion is the process in which a glacier scrapes underlying rock.
The sediments and rocks frozen in the ice at the bottom and sides of a glacier act like sandpaper.
They wear away rock.
They may also leave scratches and grooves that show the direction the glacier moved.
These grooves are called glacial striations .
Valley glaciers create several unique features through erosion.
As a valley glacier flows through a V-shaped river valley, it scrapes away the sides of the valley.
It carves a U-shaped valley with nearly vertical walls ( Figure below ).

The glacier on the left is carving out the sides of a valley.
The U-shaped valley on the right is what will be left when the glacier melts away.
A hanging valley was cut off from the main valley by a larger glacier ( Figure below ).
Yosemite is an example of a hanging valley
The waterfall on the right flows through a glacial valley.
A larger glacier carved the valley the water falls into.
There is a waterfall because this is a hanging valley.
A cirque is a rounded hollow carved near the top of a mountain by a glacier ( Figure below ).
