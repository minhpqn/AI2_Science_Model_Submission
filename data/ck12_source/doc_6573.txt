Oxidation can be defined as the addition of oxygen to a molecule or the removal of hydrogen from a molecule.
When an alkane is heated in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, it can be oxidized to the corresponding alkene in a reaction called a dehydrogenation reaction.
Two hydrogen atoms are removed in the process.
The alkene can be further oxidized to an alkyne by the removal of two more hydrogen atoms.
\text{oxidation} \qquad \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_3 \xrightarrow{-\text{H}_2} \text{CH}_2 \text{=CH}_2 \xrightarrow{-\text{H}_2} \text{CH}{\equiv}\text{CH}
The reactions are reversible, and so an alkyne can be reduced first to an alkene and then to an alkane.
\text{reduction} \qquad \text{CH}{\equiv}\text{CH}\xrightarrow{+\text{H}_2} \text{CH}_2\text{=CH}_2 \xrightarrow{+\text{H}_2} \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_3
The alkane is the most reduced form of a hydrocarbon, while the alkyne is the most oxidized form.
Oxidation reactions in organic chemistry often involve the addition of oxygen to a compound, which changes the particular functional group of that compound.
The following sequence shows how methane can be oxidized first to methanol, then to methanal, then to methanoic acid, and finally to carbon dioxide.
& \text{CH}_4 \xrightarrow{\text{gain of oxygen}} \text{CH}_3\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{loss of hydrogen}} \text{CH}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{gain of oxygen}} \text{HCOOH} \xrightarrow{\text{loss of hydrogen}} \text{CO}_2 \\& \text{methane} \qquad \qquad \text{methanol} \qquad \qquad\quad \ \ \text{methanal} \qquad \qquad \text{methanoic acid}
Each step in the process is either a gain of oxygen or a loss of hydrogen.
Each step also releases energy, which explains why the complete combustion of alkanes to carbon dioxide is an extremely exothermic reaction.
The oxidation of an alcohol can produce either an aldehyde or a ketone.
Ethanol can be oxidized in the laboratory through a heating process combined with the addition of an oxidizing agent such as the dichromate ion, which catalyzes the reaction in an acidic solution.
The reaction produces the aldehyde ethanal (acetaldehyde).
\text{CH}_3 \text{CH}_2 \text{OH} \xrightarrow[{\text{H}^+}]{\text{Cr}_2 \text{O}^{2-}_7} \text{CH}_3 \text{CHO}
Oxidation of ethanol can yield acetaldehyde
When the alcohol to be oxidized is a secondary alcohol, the oxidation product is a ketone rather than an aldehyde.
The oxidation of the simplest secondary alcohol, 2-propanol, yields propanone.
