Amniotic eggs were the first eggs that could be laid on land.
The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago.
They may have looked like the animal in Figure below .
Within a few million years, two important amniote groups evolved: synapsids and sauropsids.
Synapsids evolved into mammals.
The sauropsids gave rise to reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds.
An early, reptile-like amniote
Early Amniote.
The earliest amniotes probably looked something like this.
They were reptile-like, but not actually reptiles.
Reptiles evolved somewhat later.
The earliest animals evolved from colonial protists more than 600 million years ago.
Many important animal adaptations evolved in invertebrates, including tissues and a brain.
The first animals to live on land were invertebrates.
Amphibians were the first vertebrates to live on land.
Amniotes were the first animals that could reproduce on land.
