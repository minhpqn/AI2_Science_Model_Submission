Calculations with Equilibrium Constants
Perform equilibrium constant calculations.
Ferrozine is used to assess the amount of iron in human blood because it tightly binds iron
Iron is an important component of red cells.
Patients who have low iron will usually be anemic and have a lower than normal number of red blood cells.
One way to assess serum iron concentration is with the use of Ferrozine, a complex organic molecule.
Ferrozine forms a product with Fe 3+ , producing a pink color.
In order to determine factors affecting the reaction, we need to measure the equilibrium constant.
If the equilibrium does not lie far in the direction of products, precautions need to be taken when using this material to measure iron in serum.
Calculations with Equilibrium Constants
The general value of the equilibrium constant gives us information about whether the reactants or the products are favored at equilibrium.
Since the product concentrations are in the numerator of the equilibrium expression, a K_{eq} > 1 means that the products are favored over the reactants.
A  K_{eq}< 1 means that the reactants are favored over the products.
Though it would often seem that the  K_{eq} value would have various units depending on the values of the exponents in the expression, the general rule is that any units are dropped.
All  K_{eq} values will be reported as having no units.

Calculating an Equilibrium Constant
Equilibrium occurs when nitrogen monoxide gas reacts with oxygen gas to form nitrogen dioxide gas.
2\text{NO}(g)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightleftarrows 2\text{NO}_2(g)
At equilibrium at 230Â°C, the concentrations are measured to be [NO] = 0.0542 M, [O 2 ] = 0.127 M, and [NO 2 ] = 15.5 M.
