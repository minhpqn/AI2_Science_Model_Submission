Typical of multi-celled organisms; have membrane bound organelles; usually larger than prokaryotic cells.
flagella (singular, flagellum ):
A "tail-like" appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; used for locomotion.
microvilli :
Cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area of cells.
neuron :
An electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information by electrical and chemical signaling; a nerve cell.
prokaryotic cell :
Typical of simple, single-celled organisms, such as bacteria; lack a nucleus and other membrane bound organelles.
structure-function relationship :
Principle that states the function of a biological item (molecule, protein, cell) is determined by its structure.
Cell size is limited by a cell's surface area to volume ratio.
A smaller cell is more effective and transporting materials, including waste products, than a larger cell.
Cells come in many different shapes.
A cell's function is determined, in part, by its shape.
