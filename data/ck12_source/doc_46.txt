Fungi:
Fungi, such as mushrooms and molds, survive by "eating" other organisms or the remains of other organisms.
These organisms absorb their nutrients from other organisms.
Animalia:
Animals also survive by eating other organisms or the remains of other organisms.
Animals range from tiny ants to the largest whales, and include arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals ( Figure below ).
Protista:
Protists are not all descended from a single common ancestor in the way that plants, animals, and fungi are.
Protists are all the eukaryotic organisms that do not fit into one of the other three kingdoms.
They include many kinds of microscopic one-celled (unicellular) organisms, such as algae and plankton, but also giant seaweeds that can grow to be 200 feet long.

Diversity of Animals.
These photos give just an inkling of the diversity of organisms that belong to the animal kingdom. (A) Sponge, (B) Flatworm, (C) Flying Insect, (D) Frog, (E) Tiger, (F) Gorilla.
Plants, animals, fungi, and protists might seem very different, but remember that if you look through a microscope, you will find similar cells with a membrane-bound nucleus in all of them.
These are eukaryotic cells .
These cells also have membrane-bound organelles , which prokaryotic cells lack.
The main characteristics of the three domains of life are summarized in Table below .
