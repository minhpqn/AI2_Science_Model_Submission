This makes all machines less than 100 percent efficient.
Because compound machines have more moving parts than simple machines, they generally have more friction to overcome.
As a result, compound machines tend to have lower efficiency than simple machines.
When a compound machine consists of many simple machines, friction can become a serious problem, and it may produce a lot of heat.
Lubricants such as oil or grease may be used to coat the moving parts of a machine so they slide over each other more easily.
This is how friction is reduced in a car engine.
Mechanical Advantage of Compound Machines
The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which it changes the force applied to the machine.
Many machines increase the force applied to them, and this is how they make work easier.
Compound machines tend to have a greater mechanical advantage than simple machines.
Thatâ€™s because the mechanical advantage of a compound machine equals the product of the mechanical advantages of all its component simple machines.
The greater the number of simple machines it contains, the greater its mechanical advantage tends to be.
Q :
Assume that the lever and the wheel and axle of a wheelbarrow each have a mechanical advantage of 2.
What is the mechanical advantage of the wheelbarrow?
A :
The mechanical advantage of the wheelbarrow is the product of the mechanical advantage of the lever (2) and the mechanical advantage of the wheel and axle (2).
Therefore, the wheelbarrow has a mechanical advantage of 4.
A compound machine is a machine that consists of more than one simple machine.
Compound machines such as a wheelbarrow or corkscrew consist of just two simple machines.
