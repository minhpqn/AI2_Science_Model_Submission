Surface Ocean Currents
Define major and local surface currents.
Explain how major and local surface currents are created.
What can debris tell us about surface currents?
The surface of the ocean is on the move.
One way to see this is when something is dumped in the ocean.
Where will it end up?
The tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 pulled a lot of material into the ocean.
The image above is a model created in April 2012.
The orange and red are where floating debris might be.
Scientists are creating models of where the debris will go.
But no one knows for sure where it will go or when it will get there.
Like air in the atmosphere, ocean water moves in currents.
A current is a stream of moving water that flows through the ocean.
Surface currents are caused mainly by winds but not daily winds.
Surface currents are caused by the major wind belts.
