Some organisms can get the energy directly from the sun.
Other organisms get their energy from other organisms.
Through predator-prey relationships , the energy of one organism is passed on to another.
Energy is constantly flowing through a community.
With just a few exceptions, all life on Earth depends on the sunâ€™s energy for survival.
The energy of the sun is first captured by producers ( Figure below ), organisms that can make their own food.
Many producers make their own food through the process of photosynthesis .
The "food" the producers make is the sugar, glucose .
Producers make food for the rest of the ecosystem.
As energy is not recycled, energy must consistently be captured by producers.
This energy is then passed on to the organisms that eat the producers, and then to the organisms that eat those organisms, and so on.
Recall that the only required ingredients needed for photosynthesis are sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and water (H 2 O).
From these simple inorganic ingredients, photosynthetic organisms produce the carbohydrate glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), and other complex organic compounds.
Essentially, these producers are changing the energy from the sunlight into a usable form of energy.
They are also making the oxygen that we breathe.
Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis.
The survival of every ecosystem is dependent on the producers.
Without producers capturing the energy from the sun and turning it into glucose, an ecosystem could not exist.
On land, plants are the dominant producers.
Phytoplankton , tiny photosynthetic organisms, are the most common producers in the oceans and lakes.
