High biodiversity makes ecosystems more stable.
What can happen to an ecosystem if just one species goes extinct?
What if that one species was a producer or decomposer ?
Would the loss of a producer have an effect on all the organisms that relied on that producer?
If a decomposer vanishes, are there other decomposers to fill the void?
Maybe the resulting species will adapt.
Other species may fill in the niche left by the extinct species.
But the extinction of one species could have a "domino" effect, resulting in the extinction of other species.
This could greatly effect the stability of the whole ecosystem.
One important role of biodiversity is that it helps keep the nutrients, such as nitrogen, in the soil.
For example, a diversity of organisms in the soil allows nitrogen fixation and nutrient recycling to happen.
Biodiversity also allows plants to be pollinated by different types of insects.
And of course, different species of fungi are necessary to recycle wastes from dead plants and animals.
These are just a few of the many examples of how biodiversity is important for ecosystems.
Biodiversity is a measurement of the amount of variation of the species in a given area.
Biodiversity is important because it directly benefits humans and ecosystems.
