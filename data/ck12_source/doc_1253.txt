The crust gets older away from the ridge crest.
It has cooled and has more sediment.
Diagram of the age of the seafloor
Seafloor is youngest near the mid-ocean ridges and gets progressively older with distance from the ridge.
Orange areas show the youngest seafloor.
The oldest seafloor is near the edges of continents or deep sea trenches.
This leads to an important idea: some process is creating seafloor at the ridge crest.
Somehow the older seafloor is being destroyed.
Finally, we get to the mechanism for continental drift.
Data from magnetometers dragged behind ships looking for enemy submarines in WWII discovered amazing magnetic patterns on the seafloor.
The magnetic pole reverses from time to time.
The north pole becomes the south pole, and the south pole becomes the north pole.
Rocks of normal and reversed polarity are found in stripes symmetrically about the mid-ocean ridge axis.
The seafloor is youngest at the ridge crest and oldest far away from the ridge crest.
The oldest seafloor rocks are about 180 million years, much younger than the oldest continental rocks.
