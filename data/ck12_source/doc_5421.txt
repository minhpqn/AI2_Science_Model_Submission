The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, three adjacent structural genes which code for enzymes and a terminator.
The three genes are: lacZ, lacY, and lacA.
The Z gene encodes Î²-galactosidase, the Y gene encodes permease, and the A gene encodes transacetylase.
All three genes are controlled by the same regulatory elements.
See Genes can be turned on and off at for a detailed animation of the lac operon.
The lac operon.
The lac operon contains genes for three enzymes, lac, lacY, and lac A, as well as the promoter, operator, and terminatory regulatory regions.
In bacteria, the lac repressor protein blocks the synthesis of enzymes that digest lactose when there is no lactose present.
When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing it to detach from the DNA strand.
This mechanism is known as induction and is illustrated in ( Figure below ).
Specific control of the lac operon depends on the availability of lactose.
The enzymes needed to metabolize lactose are not produced when lactose is not present.
When lactose is available, and therefore needs to be metabolized, the operon is turned on, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, and the three genes are transcribed into a single mRNA molecule.
However, if lactose is not present (and therefore does not need to be metabolized), the operon is turned off by the lac repressor protein.
The lacI gene, which encodes the lac repressor, lies near the lac operon and is constitutively expressed.
Therefore, the lac repressor protein is always present in the bacteria.
In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor protein will bind to the operator, just past the promoter in the lac operon.
The repressor blocks the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, keeping the operon turned off.
Under this condition, no mRNA is produced from the operon.
When lactose is available, a lactose metabolite called allolactose binds to the allosteric site on the repressor..
