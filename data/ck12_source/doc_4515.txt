Identify the two major divisions of the peripheral nervous system.
What is the role of the sensory division?
Compare and contrast the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.
What are the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system?
What is the role of the sympathetic division?
Explain how sensory stimuli are perceived and interpreted.
Summarize the roles of the cornea, lens, pupil and retina.
Explain the role of the cochlea and semicircular canals.
Describe the roles of taste receptors, odor receptors, and pressure receptors.
Name the five senses.
Hearing, sight, taste, touch, and smell.
But how do we hear, see, taste, touch and smell?
It all has to do, obviously, with the nervous system.
The sensory division of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes several sense organsâ€”the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and skin.
Each sense organ has special cells, called sensory receptors , that respond to a particular type of stimulus.
For example, the nose has sensory receptors that respond to chemicals, which we perceive as odors.
Sensory receptors send nerve impulses to sensory nerves , which carry the nerve impulses to the central nervous system.
The brain then interprets the nerve impulses to form a response.
Sight is the ability to sense light, and the eye is the organ that senses light.
Light first passes through the cornea of the eye, which is a clear outer layer that protects the eye (see Figure below ).
