What is an allergen?
Give two examples.
Define anaphylaxis.
What causes the symptoms of anaphylaxis?
Sometimes people with an allergy get allergy shots.
They are injected with tiny amounts of the allergen that triggers the allergic reaction.
The shots are repeated at regular intervals, and the amount of allergen that is injected each time gradually increases.
How do you think this might help an allergy?
Do you think this approach just treats allergy symptoms or might it cure the allergy?
Describe how autoimmune diseases affect the body.
List and describe common autoimmune diseases.
Joint pain.
Not an uncommon problem as you grow older.
Is it due to normal wear and tear on the joints?
Possibly.
But rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system fails to recognize the body’s own molecules as “self,” or belonging to the person.
Instead, it attacks body cells as though they were dangerous pathogens.
There are more than 80 known autoimmune diseases.
Recall that regulatory T cells help regulate the immune system.
