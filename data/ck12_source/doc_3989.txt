This flowchart helps to determine if a species is an autotroph or a heterotroph, a phototroph or a chemotroph
This flowchart helps to determine if a species is an autotroph or a heterotroph, a phototroph or a chemotroph.
For example, “Obtain carbon elsewhere?” asks if the source of carbon is another organism.
If the answer is “yes”, the organism is heterotrophic.
If the answer is “no,” the organisms is autotrophic.
Prokaryotes fulfill their carbon and energy needs in various ways.
They may be photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs, photoheterotrophs, or chemoheterotrophs.
