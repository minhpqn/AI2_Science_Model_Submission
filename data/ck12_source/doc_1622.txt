Therefore these are still types of passive transport.
Drawing of facilitated diffusion
Protein channels and carrier proteins are involved in passive transport.
Passive transport does not require energy input.
An example of passive transport is diffusion, the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
Carrier proteins and channel proteins are involved in facilitated diffusion.
