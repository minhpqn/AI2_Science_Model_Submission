Do the animated experiment at the following URL.
First, select water as the solvent and sodium chloride as the solute.
Then, determine the boiling and freezing points of a solution containing different masses of the solute, while holding the mass of solvent constant at 200 grams.
Test at least five different masses of the solute, and record your results in a data table.
Finally, write a brief summary of what your data reveal about boiling point elevation and freezing point depression of saltwater solutions.
What is freezing point depression?
Give an example of boiling point elevation.
Assume you are going to boil water to cook spaghetti.
If you add salt to the water, how will this affect the temperature at which the water boils?
How might it affect the time it takes the spaghetti to cook?
Describe how temperature and pressure affect solubility.
Rhonda wanted to see if salt or sugar dissolves faster in water.
She added the same amount of salt and sugar to a half liter of room temperature (20 °C) water in separate glasses.
Then she stirred both mixtures.
All of the sugar dissolved in less than a minute, but after 5 minutes of stirring, some of the salt still hadn’t dissolved.
Even if she had kept stirring the saltwater mixture all day, the remaining salt would not dissolve.
Do you know why?
The answer is their solubility.
What Is Solubility?
Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature.
