The eggs are retained inside the mother’s body for at least a couple of weeks.
During that time, the mother provides the eggs with nutrients.
Platypus females lay their eggs in a burrow.
Echidna females have a pouch in which they store their eggs.
Female monotremes have mammary glands but lack nipples.
Instead, they “sweat” milk from a patch on their belly.
Pros and Cons of Monotreme Reproduction
The mother’s risks are less in monotremes than in therian mammals.
The mother doesn’t need to eat more or put herself at risk by carrying and delivering a fetus or an embryo.
On the other hand, externally laid eggs are more difficult to protect than an embryo in a pouch or a fetus in a uterus.
Therefore, monotreme offspring may be less likely to survive than the offspring of therian mammals.
Monotremes reproduce by laying eggs.
Monotremes have a cloaca instead of a uterus and vagina.
The eggs pass through the opening of the cloaca.
Monotreme reproduction is the least risky for the mother.
However, eggs are harder to protect than is an embryo or a fetus in a pouch or uterus.
Therefore, monotreme offspring may have a lower chance of surviving than the offspring of therian mammals.
