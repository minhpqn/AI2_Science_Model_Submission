Producers are living things that use energy to make food.
Producers make food for themselves and other living things.
There are two types of producers:
By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food.
This is called photosynthesis .
Producers that photosynthesize include plants and algae.
These organisms must live where there is plenty of sunlight.
Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food.
This is called chemosynthesis .
Only a very few producers are of this type, and all of them are microbes.
These producers live deep under the ocean where there is no sunlight.
An example is pictured below ( Figure below ).
A picture of an ecosystem on the ocean floor
Microbes use chemicals to make food.
The chemicals pour out of a crack on the ocean floor at a mid-ocean ridge.
What consumers live in this ecosystem?
Consumers canâ€™t make their own food.
Consumers must eat producers or other consumers.
Listed below are the three main types of consumers ( Figure below ): herbivores , carnivores , and omnivores .
Which type are you?
