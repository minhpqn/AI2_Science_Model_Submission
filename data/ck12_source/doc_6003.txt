The result is what you would expect.
In order to make five ham sandwiches, you would need 10 slices of ham and 5 slices of cheese.
This type of calculation demonstrates the use of stoichiometry.
Stoichiometry is the calculation of the amount of substances in a chemical reaction from the balanced equation.
The sample problem below is another stoichiometry problem involving ingredients of the ideal ham sandwich.
Sample Problem:
Ham Sandwich Stoichiometry
Kim looks in the refrigerator and finds that she has 8 slices of ham.
In order to make as many sandwiches as possible, how many pickles does she need?
Use the equation above.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
have 8 ham slices (H)
2 H = 5 P (conversion factor)
How many pickles (P) needed?
The coefficients for the two reactants (ingredients) are used to make a conversion factor between ham slices and pickles.
Step 2:
Solve.
8 \ \text{H} \times \frac{5 \ \text{P}}{2 \ \text{H}}=20 \ \text{P}
Since 5 pickles combine with 2 ham slices in each sandwich, 20 pickles are needed to fully combine with 8 ham slices.
