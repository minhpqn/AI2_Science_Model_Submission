Rather, at lower temperatures, the amount of products formed is simply not great enough to say that the products are favored.
When this reaction is performed, the amount of products can be detected by monitoring the pressure of the CO 2 gas that is produced.
Above about 700°C, measurable amounts of CO 2 are produced.
The pressure of CO 2 at equilibrium gradually increases with increasing temperature.
Above 835°C, the pressure of CO 2 at equilibrium begins to exceed 1 atm, the standard-state pressure.
This is an indication that the products of the reaction are now favored above that temperature.
When quicklime is manufactured, the CO 2 is constantly removed from the reaction mixture as it is produced.
This causes the reaction to be driven towards the products according to LeChâtelier’s principle.
The influence of temperature on free energy is described.
Read the material at the link below and answer the following questions:
Is an exothermic reaction where entropy increases spontaneous or nonspontaneous?
Give an example of a process where a process proceeds spontaneously only below a certain temperature.
If  \Delta H > 0 and \Delta S < 0 , can the reaction ever be spontaneous?
If you increased the pressure of CO 2 in the quicklime reaction, what would happen to the equilibrium?
Why do we calculate the situation where  \Delta G is zero?
At temperatures below 835°C, is any product formed?
Changes of State and Free Energy
Describe how a change of state influences free energy.
An increase in the level of energy can cause a change in state
How are energy and changes of state related?
