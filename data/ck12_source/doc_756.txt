Approximately 5000 megawatt-hours of energy passes through this particular substation each year.
Energy Transfer in Electric Circuits
Electric power is the energy per unit time converted by an electric circuit into another form of energy.
We already know that power through a circuit is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current in a circuit:  P = VI .
It is possible to determine the power dissipated in a single resistor if we combine this expression with Ohm’s Law, V = IR .
This becomes particularly useful in circuits with more than one resistor, to determine the power dissipated in each one.
Combining these two equations, we get an expression for electric power that involves only the current and resistance in a circuit.
P = I^2R
The power dissipated in a resistor is proportional to the square of the current that passes through it and to its resistance.
Electrical energy itself can be expressed as the electrical power multiplied by time:
E = Pt
We can incorporate this equation to obtain an equation for electrical energy based on current, resistance, and time.
The electrical energy across a resistor is determined to be the current squared multiplied by the resistance and the time.
E = I^2Rt
This equation holds true in ideal situations.
However, devices used to convert electrical energy into other forms of energy are never 100% efficient.
An electric motor is used to convert electrical energy into kinetic energy, but some of the electrical energy in this process is lost to thermal energy.
When a lamp converts electrical energy into light energy, some electrical energy is lost to thermal energy.
Example Problem:
A heater has a resistance of 25.0 Ω and operates on 120.0 V.
