F_s=\mu _sF_N=.6\times 25.5\mathrm{N}=15.3\mathrm{N}
The force of static friction is greater than the component of gravity that is forcing the block down the inclined plane.
Therefore the force of friction will match the force of the x-component of gravity.
So the net force on the block is \mathrm{net~force~in~the~x-direction:}~\overbrace{14.7\mathrm{N}}^{x-component~of~gravity}-\overbrace{14.7\mathrm{N}}^{force~of~friction}=0\mathrm{N}\\\\mathrm{net~force~in~the~y-direction:}~\underbrace{25.5\mathrm{N}}_{Normal~Force}-\underbrace{25.5\mathrm{N}}_{y-component~of~gravity}=0\mathrm{N} Therefore the net force on the block is 0\mathrm{N} .
