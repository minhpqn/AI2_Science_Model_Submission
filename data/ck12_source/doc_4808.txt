The alpha-helices and beta-sheets are folded into a compact globule structure.
Stability is maintained through hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and other interactions.
Quaternary structure is a larger assembly of several polypeptide chains, now referred to as subunits of the protein.
The quaternary structure is stabilized by the same interactions as the tertiary structure.
Complexes of two or more polypeptides are called multimers.
Specifically, a dimer contains two subunits, a trimer contains three subunits, and a tetramer contains four subunits.
Protein Structure.
Primary protein structure is the sequence of amino acids in a single polypeptide.
Secondary protein structure refers to internal shapes, such as alpha helices and beta pleated sheets, that a single polypeptide takes on due to bonds between atoms in different parts of the polypeptide.
Tertiary protein structure is the overall three-dimensional shape of a protein consisting of one polypeptide.
Quaternary protein structure is the shape of a protein consisting of two or more polypeptides.

The atomic mass of proteins is measured in kilodaltons (kDa).
One dalton (Da) is approximately equal to the mass of one proton or one neutron, so a carbon atom has a mass of approximately 12 Da.
The molecular weights of amino acids range from 75 Da for glycine to 204 for tryptophan.
Human proteins may have molecular weights ranging from a low of about 3.7 kDA to titian, the largest known human protein with 34,350 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 3,816.2 kDa.
Functions of Proteins
Proteins are an essential part of all organisms.
They play many roles in living things.
Certain proteins provide a scaffolding that maintains the shape of cells (structural proteins).
