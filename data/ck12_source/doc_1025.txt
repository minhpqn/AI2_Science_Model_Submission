The increase in atmospheric CO 2 is due to the increase in the amount of fossil fuels that are being burned.
To test hypothesis 2, we need to see if the amount of CO 2 gas released by fossil fuels over the past several decades has increased.
We look into the scientific literature and find the following graph ( Figure below ).
Graph representing sources of carbon dioxide emissions over time
Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel consumption and cement production.
The black line represents all emission types combined.
The colored lines show emissions from individual fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels have added an increasing amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid 19th century.
Hypothesis 2 appears to be at least partly true!
It is very important when testing hypotheses to eliminate any bias.
A biased researcher may miss important factors that do not match his bias.
It actually is good to try to disprove your own hypothesis!
Having other researchers involved will also help to eliminate bias.
Science is falsifiable.
An incorrect hypothesis is discarded.
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are increasing.
Fossil fuel burning is increasing.
The rise in fossil fuel burning is increasing the CO 2 in the atmosphere.
More than one hypothesis can be tested at a time.
This is called multiple working hypotheses.
