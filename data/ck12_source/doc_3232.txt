You can learn more about calculating the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic waves at these URLs: and
All electromagnetic waves travel across space at the speed of light, which is about 300 million meters per second (3.0 x 10 8 m/s).
Electromagnetic waves vary in wavelength and frequency.
Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies.
Higher frequency waves have more energy.
The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency.
Because the speed of electromagnetic waves through space is constant, the wavelength or frequency of an electromagnetic wave can be calculated if the other value is known.
Use the calculator at the following URL to find the frequency and energy of electromagnetic waves with different wavelengths.
Use at least eight values for wavelength.
Record and make a table of the results.
What is the speed of light across space?
Describe the range of wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic waves.
How is the energy of an electromagnetic wave related to its frequency?
If the frequency of an electromagnetic wave is 6.0 × 10 8 Hz, what is its wavelength?
Describe electromagnetic radiation and its properties.
Give an overview of the electromagnetic spectrum.
It’s a warm sunny Saturday, and Michael and Lavar have a big day planned.
They’re going to ride across town to meet their friends and then go to the zoo.
The boys may not realize it, but they will be bombarded by electromagnetic radiation as they ride their bikes and walk around the zoo grounds.
The only kinds of radiation they can detect are visible light, which allows them to see, and infrared light, which they feel as warmth on their skin.
