The smaller masses are m_A and m_B ; the angle of the incline is \theta , and the coefficient of kinetic friction between each of the masses and the incline has been measured and determined to be \mu_K .
Draw free body diagrams for each of the three masses.
Calculate the magnitude of the frictional force on each of the smaller masses in terms of the given quantities.
Calculate the net force on the hanging mass in terms of the given quantities.
Calculate the magnitudes of the two tension forces T_A and T_B in terms of the given quantities.
Design and state a strategy for solving for how long it will take the larger mass to hit the ground, assuming at this moment it is at a height h above the ground.
Do not attempt to solve this: simply state the strategy for solving it.
You build a device for lifting objects, as shown below.
A rope is attached to the ceiling and two masses are allowed to hang from it.
The end of the rope passes around a pulley (right) where you can pull it downward to lift the two objects upward.
The angles of the ropes, measured with respect to the vertical, are shown.
Assume the bodies are at rest initially.
Suppose you are able to measure the masses m_1 and m_2 of the two hanging objects as well as the tension T_C .
Do you then have enough information to determine the other two tensions, T_A and T_B ?
Explain your reasoning.
If you only knew the tensions T_A and T_C , would you have enough information to determine the masses m_1 and m_2 ?
If so, write m_1 and m_2 in terms of T_A and T_C .
If not, what further information would you require?
A stunt driver is approaching a cliff at very high speed.
Sensors in his car have measured the acceleration and velocity of the car, as well as all forces acting on it, for various times.
