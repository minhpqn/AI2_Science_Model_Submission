How do you explain the variation in temperature from Austin, Texas to Thompson, Manitoba, Canada?
What are two reasons that solar radiation is different at different latitudes?
Look at the map of temperature versus latitude around the globe.
Why are the bands not straight across?
Effect of Atmospheric Circulation on Climate
Explain how climate relates to the global winds.
Describe how atmospheric circulation influences precipitation.
Would you like to go to the horse latitudes?
Imagine you're on a sailing ship that's carrying horses among other cargo.
You want to go from Spain to northern South America.
For a smooth ride west, you need to get the ship into the trade winds.
But where the trade winds and the westerlies meet is a zone where air flows vertically downward.
It's hard to get through there in a sailing ship.
So your ship gets stuck.
For weeks.
There's no more water or food for the horses so you throw them overboard.
