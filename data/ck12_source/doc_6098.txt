P_2=\frac{3.00 \text{ atm} \times 1118 \text{ K}}{298 \text{ K}}=11.3 \text{ atm}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The pressure increases dramatically due to large increase in temperature.
Pressure and temperature at constant volume are directly proportional.
Work on the problems found at the web site below:
Explain Gay-Lussac’s Law in terms of the kinetic-molecular theory.
What would a graph of pressure vs. temperature show us?
What is the difference in containers in Charles’ Law and Gay-Lussac’s Law?
Gay-Lussac’s law:
The pressure of a given mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas, when the volume is kept constant.
Combined Gas Law
State the combined gas law.
Use the law to calculate parameters in general gas problems.
A refrigerator uses the combined gas law to dissipate heat
What keeps things cold?
The modern refrigerator takes advantage of the gas laws to remove heat from a system.
Compressed gas in the coils (see above) is allowed to expand.
This expansion lowers the temperature of the gas and transfers heat energy from the material in the refrigerator to the gas.
As the gas is pumped through the coils, the pressure on the gas compresses it and raises the gas temperature.
