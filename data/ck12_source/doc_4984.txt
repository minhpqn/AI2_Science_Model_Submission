Biochemistry - Advanced
What do you get when you cross biology and chemistry?
Hummingbirds, with their tiny bodies and high levels of activity, have the highest metabolic rates of any animals — roughly a dozen times that of a pigeon and a hundred times that of an elephant.
The metabolic rate, or rate of metabolism, has to do with the amount of energy the organism uses.
And that energy is used to drive the chemical reactions in cells — or the biochemical reactions.
And, of course, it is all the biochemical reactions that allow the cells function properly, and maintain life.
Biochemical Energy - Advanced
Define energy, and describe how energy can be changed from one form to another.
What is energy?
Where does your energy come from?
Can energy be recycled?
This team of ants is breaking down a dead tree.
A classic example of teamwork.
And all that work takes energy.
In fact, each chemical reaction - the chemical reactions that allow the cells in those ants to do the work - needs energy to get started.
And all that energy comes from the food the ants eat.
Whatever eats the ants gets their energy from the ants.
Energy passes through an ecosystem in one direction only.
Matter and Energy
All living things are made of matter .
