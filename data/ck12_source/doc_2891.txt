Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) carries the instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. mRNA is produced in the nucleus, as are all RNAs.
The other two forms of RNA, ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) and transfer RNA ( tRNA ), are involved in the process of ordering the amino acids to make the protein. rRNA becomes part of the ribosome, which is the site of protein synthesis, and tRNA brings an amino acid to the ribosome so it can be added to a growing chain during protein synthesis.
There are numerous tRNAs, as each tRNA is specific for an amino acid.
The amino acid actually attaches to the tRNA during this process.
More about RNAs will be discussed during the Transcription and Translation Concepts.
All three RNAs are nucleic acids, made of nucleotides, similar to DNA ( Figure below ).
The RNA nucleotide is different from the DNA nucleotide in the following ways:
RNA contains a different kind of sugar, called ribose.
In RNA, the base uracil (U) replaces the thymine (T) found in DNA.
RNA is a single strand molecule.

RNA is a nucleic acid, like DNA, but differs slightly in its structure.
