A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that spreads through sexual contact.
STIs are caused by pathogens , a living thing or virus that causes infection.
The pathogens enter the body through the reproductive organs.
Many STIs also spread through body fluids, such as blood.
For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way an STI could spread.
Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her baby during childbirth.
STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people.
One reason is that young people are more likely to take risks.
They also may not know how STIs spread.
They are likely to believe myths about STIs ( Table below ).
If you are sexually active with just one person, you can’t get STIs.
The only way to avoid the risk of STIs is to practice abstinence from sexual activity.
If you don’t have any symptoms, then you don’t have an STI.
Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in females.
Getting STIs is no big deal, because STIs can be cured with medicine.
Only some STIs can be cured with medicine; other STIs cannot be cured.
Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses.
STIs caused by bacteria usually can be cured with drugs called antibiotics.
But antibiotics are not effective against viruses.
Therefore, STIs caused by viruses are not treated with antibiotics.
