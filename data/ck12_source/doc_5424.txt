If tryptophan levels are high, the leader peptide is translated fully and the ribosome continues through to the stop codon.
The ribosome physically sits on segments 1 and 2 of the leader sequence, allowing the 3-4 hairpin structure to form, which terminates transcription as RNA polymerase falls off the DNA.
The operon is only transcribed when tryptophan is unavailable for the ribosome.
The transcriptional attenuation of the trp operon involves the formation of mRNA stem-loops from the trpL leader region.
In the presence of tryptophan the 3-4 hairpin structure acts as a termination structure, while with low levels of tryptophan the 2-3 hairpin structure allows transcription to continue.
A similar attenuation mechanism regulates the synthesis of histidine, phenylalanine, and threonine.
allolactose :
A disaccharide similar to lactose; it is an inducer of the lac operon in E. coli.
anti-termination hairpin :
RNA structure of an operon leader region that allows transcription to continue.
attenuation :
A regulatory mechanism in some bacterial operons which results in premature termination of transcription.
allosteric site :
The place on an enzyme where a molecule that is not a substrate may bind, thus changing the shape of the enzyme and influencing its ability to be active.
attenuator sequence :
A nucleotide sequence in DNA that can lead to premature termination of transcription.
inducer :
An agent capable of activating specific genes; a molecule that inhibits the action of the repressor of an operon, preventing it from freely binding with the operator gene and disabling its function.
induction :
Involves determining a general statement that is very likely to be true, from several facts; the relief of repression for a gene or set of genes under negative control.
