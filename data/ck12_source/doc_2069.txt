But there are many different kinds of fuel.
For fuel to be useful, its energy must be released in a way that can be controlled.
When fuel is burned, most of the energy is released as heat .
Some of this heat can be used to do work.
Heat cooks food or warms your house.
Sometimes the heat is just waste heat.
It still heats the environment, though.
Heat from a wood fire can boil a pot of water.
If you put an egg in the pot, you can eat a hard boiled egg in 15 minutes (cool it down first!).
The energy to cook the egg was stored in the wood.
The wood got that energy from the Sun when it was part of a tree.
The Sun generated the energy by nuclear fusion.
You started the fire with a match.
The head of the match stores energy as chemical energy.
That energy lights the wood on fire.
The fire burns as long as there is energy in the wood.
Once the wood has burned up, there is no energy left in it.
The fire goes out.
Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day.
Cooking your food takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer.
