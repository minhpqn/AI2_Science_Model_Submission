The oldest horse fossils show what the earliest horses were like.
They were about the size of a fox, and they had four long toes.
Other evidence shows they lived in wooded marshlands, where they probably ate soft leaves.
Through time, the climate became drier, and grasslands slowly replaced the marshes.
Later fossils show that horses changed as well.
They became taller, which would help them see predators while they fed in tall grasses.
They evolved a single large toe that eventually became a hoof.
This would help them run swiftly and escape predators.
Their molars (back teeth) became longer and covered with cement.
This would allow them to grind tough grasses and grass seeds without wearing out their teeth.
Similar fossil evidence demonstrates the evolution of the whale, moving from the land into the sea.
