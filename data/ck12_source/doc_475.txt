Outline the divisions of the peripheral nervous system.
Distinguish the sensory division from the motor division.
Summarize responsibilities of the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.
Explain the difference between the sympathetic division and the parasympathetic division.
How does your brain connect to the rest of your body?
You know you have nerves in your fingers and toes because you can feel them.
But how does your brain know what's going on in these nerves?
You have a network of nerves running from your brain and spinal cord to your fingers and toes and the rest of your body.
This network is known as the peripheral nervous system.
The Peripheral Nervous System
There are other nerves in your body that are not found in the brain or spinal cord.
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) ( Figure below ) contains all the nerves in the body that are found outside of the central nervous system.
They include nerves of the hands, arms, feet, legs, and trunk.
They also include nerves of the scalp, neck, and face.
Nerves that send and receive messages to the internal organs are also part of the peripheral nervous system.
The blue lines in this drawing illustrate the nerves of the peripheral nervous system
The blue lines in this drawing represent nerves of the peripheral nervous system.
Every peripheral nerve is connected directly or indirectly to the spinal cord.
Notice the thick sciatic nerve.
It is the longest (and thickest) nerve in the body, running from the lower region of the spinal cord to just above the knee.
