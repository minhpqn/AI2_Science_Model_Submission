When you flip the switch, the electricity flows to the light through wires inside the walls.
The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the light, but the light still comes on as soon as you flip the switch.
Nerve impulses travel just as fast through the network of nerves inside the body.
The axons of many neurons are covered in a myelin sheath to allow for faster signal transmission
The axons of many neurons, like the one shown here, are covered with a fatty layer called myelin sheath.
The sheath covers the axon, like the plastic covering on an electrical wire, and allows nerve impulses to travel faster along the axon.
The node of Ranvier, shown in this diagram, is any gap in the myelin sheath; it allows faster transmission of a signal.
What Does a Neuron Look Like?
A neuron has a special shape that lets it pass signals from one cell to another.
A neuron has three main parts ( Figure above ):
The cell body.
The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles.
Dendrites and axons connect to the cell body, similar to rays coming off of the sun.
Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other cells.
Axons pass the nerve impulses on to other cells.
A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, so it can communicate with thousands of other cells but only one axon.
The axon is covered with a myelin sheath , a fatty layer that insulates the axon and allows the electrical signal to travel much more quickly.
The node of Ranvier is any gap within the myelin sheath exposing the axon, and it allows even faster transmission of a signal.
Types of Neurons
Neurons are usually classified based on the role they play in the body.
