The water may flow over a waterfall or through a dam.
You can see a picture of a dam in the Figure below .
A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream from the dam and reduce water flow downstream from the dam, and this can destroy ecosystems.
At the following URL, you can learn more about hydroelectric power and see an animation of a hydroelectric power plant.
This is Hoover dam on the Colorado River between Arizona and Nevada.
Water flowing through the dam generates electricity for both of these states and southern California.
Q:
Does a hydroelectric power plant release air pollution or carbon dioxide?
Why or why not.
A:
No, it is doesn’t.
A hydroelectric plant doesn’t burn fuel, which is what produces air pollution in power plants that generate electricity from fossil fuels or biomass.
The stored chemical energy in organic matter or wastes is called biomass energy.
The organic matter may be trees or other plants, or it may be wastes from homes and industries.
When biomass is burned, it produces thermal energy that can be used for heating homes, cooking, or generating electricity.
Biomass—especially wood—is an important energy source in the poorer nations where most people can’t afford fossil fuels.
However, burning biomass releases air pollution and contributes to global climate change.
Biomass can be used to make ethanol, a fuel that is added to gasoline.
Although ethanol releases less pollution than gasoline, large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to make it (see Figure below ).
This reduces the amount of land available for food production.
