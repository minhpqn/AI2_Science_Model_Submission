ENCODE:
The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
In September 2012, ENCODE, The Enc yclopedia o f D NA E lements, was announced.
ENCODE was a colossal project, involving over 440 scientists in 32 labs the world-over, whose goal was to understand the human genome.
It had been thought that about 80% of the human genome was "junk" DNA.
ENCODE has established that this is not true.
Now it is thought that about 80% of the genome is active.
In fact, much of the human genome is regulatory sequences, on/off switches that tell our genes what to do and when to do it.
Dr.
Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health which organized this project, states, "It's this incredible choreography going on, of a modest number of genes and an immense number of ... switches that are choreographing how those genes are used."
It is now thought that at least three-quarters of the genome is involved in making RNA, and most of this RNA appears to help regulate gene activity.
Scientists have also identified about 4 million sites where proteins bind to DNA and act in a regulatory capacity.
These new findings demonstrate that the human genome has remarkable and precise, and complex, controls over the expression of genetic information within a cell.

The human genome consists of about 3 billion base pairs of DNA.
In 2003, the Human Genome Project finished sequencing all 3 billion base pairs.
