How many molecules are there?
How many carbon-containing molecules are there?
The current estimate is around 20 million different organic compounds that we know about.
Why the uncertainty?
Every day, scientists are coming up with new compounds.
Some of these materials are of interest for a research project, while others are destined to be developed for a commercial market.
As soon think we know how many organic compounds exist, more are discovered and our number quickly becomes out of date.
At one time in history, it was thought that only living things were capable of synthesizing the carbon-containing compounds present in cells.
For that reason, the term organic was applied to those compounds.
Eventually it was proved that carbon-containing compounds could be synthesized from inorganic substances, but the term organic has remained.
Currently, organic compounds are defined as covalently bonded compounds containing carbon, excluding carbonates and oxides.
By this definition, compounds such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) are considered to be inorganic.
Organic chemistry is the study of all organic compounds.
Organic chemistry is a very vast and complex subject.
There are millions of known organic compounds, which is far more than the number of inorganic compounds.
The reason lies within the uniqueness of carbonâ€™s structure and bonding capabilities.
Carbon has four valence electrons and therefore makes four separate covalent bonds in compounds.
