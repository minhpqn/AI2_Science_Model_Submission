The control rods play an important role in the modulation of the nuclear chain reaction (usually a collision of a neutron with uranium).
Each collision produces more neutrons than were present initially.
If left unsupervised, the reaction would soon get out of control.
Rods are commonly made of boron or a number of metals and metal alloys.
The purpose of the control rods is to absorb neutrons to regulate the rate of the chain reaction so that the water does not overheat and destroy the reactor.

Nuclear power is also used to propel ships.
The turbine can be connected to a propeller system.
The rotating turbine shaft will turn the propeller to move the ship.
