The Figure below shows the three main parts of the ear: the outer, middle, and inner ear.
It also shows the specific structures in each part of the ear.
The roles of these structures in hearing are described below and in this animation:
Diagram of the ear
The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum.
The pinna is the only part of the ear that extends outward from the head.
Its position and shape make it good at catching sound waves and funneling them into the ear canal.
The ear canal is a tube that carries sound waves into the ear.
The sound waves travel through the air inside the ear canal to the eardrum.
The eardrum is like the head of a drum.
It is a thin membrane stretched tight across the end of the ear canal.
The eardrum vibrates when sound waves strike it, and it sends the vibrations on to the middle ear.
Q:
How might cupping his hands behind his ears help the boy pictured in the opening image hear better?
A:
His hands might help the pinna of his ears catch sound waves and direct them into the ear canal.
The middle ear contains three tiny bones (ossicles) called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup.
If you look at these bones in the Figure above , you might notice that they resemble the objects for which they are named.
The three bones transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.
The arrangement of the three bones allows them to work together as a lever that increases the amplitude of the waves as they pass to the inner ear.
