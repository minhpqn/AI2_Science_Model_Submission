\text{Molality} \ (m)=\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}}=\frac{\text{mol}}{\text{kg}}
Molality differs from molarity only in the denominator.
While molarity is based on the liters of solution, molality is based on the kilograms of solvent.
Concentrations expressed in molality are used when studying properties of solutions related to vapor pressure and temperature changes.
Molality is used because its value does not change with changes in temperature.
The volume of a solution, on the other hand, is slightly dependent upon temperature.
Sample Problem:
Calculating Molality
Determine the molality of a solution prepared by dissolving 28.60 g of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) into 250. g of water.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
mass solute= 28.60 g C 6 H 12 O 6
mass solvent = 250. g = 0.250 kg
molar mass C 6 H 12 O 6 = 180.18 g/mol
molality = ? m
Convert grams of glucose to moles and divide by the mass of the water in kilograms.
Step 2:
Solve.
28.60 \text{ g C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 \times \frac{1 \text{ mol C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6}{180.18 \text{ g C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6} &= 0.1587 \text{ mol C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6\\\frac{0.1587 \text{ mol C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6}{0.250 \text{ kg H}_2\text{O}} &= 0.635 \ m \ \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6
