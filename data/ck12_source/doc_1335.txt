A seismometer is a digital seismic wave recorder.
S-waves do not travel through liquids.
So a seismogram with no S-waves is on the other side of the planet from the quake.
Seismographs yield a tremendous amount of information about an earthquake.
Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow.
A New Project to Measure Earthquakes at
What was the largest earthquake in history?
What is Earthscope doing?
How many instruments are being installed with this project?
In what region?
How far apart are the seismometers being distributed?
What do researchers hope to do with the data?
Define seismograph, seismogram, and seismometer.
What does a seismogram with P-waves but not S-waves mean and why?
How can you tell S-wave arrival from the end of the P-wave?
Locating Earthquake Epicenters
Explain how to find an earthquake epicenter.
Can you find an earthquake epicenter?
The epicenter of the 2011 Japan earthquake was just offshore of Sendai.
This is where the Pacific Plate plunges into a subduction zone.
