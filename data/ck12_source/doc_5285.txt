How are genetic diseases usually inherited?
Complex Traits - Advanced
Discuss complex inheritance patterns.
Define codominant alleles and give examples.
Define incomplete dominance.
What does it mean to be dominant?
Well, if you're in this gorilla's troop, it better be obvious.
Could there be more than one dominant gorilla in a troop?
No.
So what happens if there are two dominant alleles of the same gene.
Do they fight until one leaves?
Or do they figure out how to get along?
Traits inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern are either dominate or recessive.
The trait is produced by only one gene.
But this is not the case for many traits; rarely is inheritance as simple as one gene with two alleles, and either dominant or recessive inheritance.
More complex patterns of inheritance are common.
These were introduced in the Non-Mendelian Inheritance concept.
Mendel’s pea plants showed complete dominance of one allele over the other.
The offspring always completely looked like one of the parents – there was never any phenotype “in between” the two parents.
The heterozygous individuals were indistinguishable from the homozygous dominant individuals.
