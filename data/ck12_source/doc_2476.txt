Q:
Alyssaâ€™s mom put some mothballs in her closet in the spring to keep moths away from her wool clothes.
By autumn, the mothballs were much smaller.
What happened to them?
A:
Mothballs are made of naphthalene, a substance that undergoes sublimation at room temperature.
The solid mothballs slowly changed to a gas during the summer months, explaining why they were much smaller by autumn.
Sublimation of Snow and Ice
Snow and ice may also undergo sublimation under certain conditions.
This is most likely to happen where there is intense sunlight, very cold temperatures, and dry winds.
These conditions are often found on mountain peaks.
As snow sublimates, it gradually shrinks without any runoff of liquid water.

Sublimation is the process in which a solid changes directly to a gas without going through the liquid state.
Solid carbon dioxide is an example of a substance that undergoes sublimation.
Snow and ice undergo sublimation under certain conditions.
This is most likely to happen where there is intense sunlight, very cold temperatures, and dry winds.

Be sure to examine the two graphs comparing changes of state in water and carbon dioxide.
