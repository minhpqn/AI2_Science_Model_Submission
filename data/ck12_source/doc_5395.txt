Two forms of NER exist within the cell.
Global genomic NER (or global excision repair) repairs damage in both transcribed and untranscribed DNA strands in active and inactive genes throughout the genome.
This process utilizes damage sensing proteins that constantly scan the DNA for distortions in the helix.
Repair proteins then verify and repair the damage.
This process is ongoing as at any one time, most of the DNA is not undergoing transcription.
Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) is a faster process than global genomic NER.
In TC-NER, RNA polymerase serves as the damage recognition signal when it stalls at a change in the shape of the DNA double helix.
This allows repair to proceed much quicker then with global repair mechanisms.
Base Excision Repair
Base excision repair repairs small, non-helix distorting changes in the DNA, usually resulting from damage during the cell cycle.
The process begins with enzymes known as DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove specific damaged or inappropriate bases, forming AP sites.
AP sites are apurinic or apyrimidinic sites (or a basic sites), which are locations in DNA that have neither a purine nor a pyrimidine base.
The gap is then recognized by an AP endonuclease, which nicks the sugar-phosphate backbone.
DNA polymerase and DNA ligase then fill in and close the gap.
