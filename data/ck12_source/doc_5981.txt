This increases the reactant counts to 2 Na atoms and 2 Cl atoms.
Then place a 2 in front of the NaNO 3 .
The result is:
\text{Pb(NO}_3)_2 (aq)+2\text{NaCl}(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{NaNO}_3 (aq)+\text{PbCl}_2(s)
The new count for each atom and polyatomic ion becomes:
1 Pb atom
1 Pb atom
2 NO 3 - ions
2 NO 3 - ions
2 Na atom
2 Na atom
2 Cl atoms
2 Cl atoms
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The equation is now balanced since there are equal numbers of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
The process of balancing chemical equations is described.
