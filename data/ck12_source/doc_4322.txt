Like annelids, echinoderms have the ability to regenerate a missing body part.
Some echinoderms can reproduce asexually by fission, but most echinoderms reproduce sexually.
They generally have separate sexes and external fertilization.
Eggs hatch into free-swimming larvae.
The larvae undergo metamorphosis to change into the adult form.
During metamorphosis, their bilateral symmetry changes to radial symmetry.
Living echinoderms are placed in five classes.
These five classes show many similarities.
Organisms in each class are described in Table below .

Echinoderms are marine invertebrates.
They include sea stars, sand dollars, and feather stars.
Echinoderms have a spiny endoskeleton.
They have radial symmetry as adults but bilateral symmetry as larvae.
Echinoderms have a unique water vascular system with tube feet.
This allows slow but powerful movement.
