Wave Motion and Sound
The Big Idea
Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in harmonic motion.
Objects in harmonic motion have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances.
They do so by creating waves in a medium.
Imagine pushing up and down on the surface of a bathtub filled with water.
Water acts as the medium that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub.
Waves transfer energy over a distance without direct contact with the initial source.
Since waves are disturbances in an existing medium, they are considered phenomena and not actual objects.
Types of Waves
Compare and contrast a longitudinal wave and a transverse wave.
Describe general wave properties.
Students will learn the difference between a longitudinal wave a transverse wave.
Students will also learn some general wave properties.
The period , T , is the amount of time for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle.
In SHM, T is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction.
The period of a wave depends on the period of oscillation of the object creating the wave.
The frequency , f , is the number of cycles an object or wave goes through in 1 second.
Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per sec.
The amplitude , A , is the distance from the equilibrium (or center) point of motion to either its lowest or highest point ( end points ).
