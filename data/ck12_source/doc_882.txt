What will it do to the lake over time?
Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic.
Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water.
Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish.
It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain.
As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.
Aquatic debris is trash that gets into fresh- and saltwater waterways.
It comes from shipping accidents, landfill erosion, or the direct dumping of trash.
Debris can be very dangerous to aquatic wildlife.
Some animals may swallow plastic bags, mistaking them for food.
Other animals can be strangled by floating trash like plastic six-pack rings.
Wildlife can easily get tangled in nets ( Figure below ).
Marine trash such as nets and plastic packaging can entangle animals
Marine trash can harm different types of aquatic life.
Pictured here is a marine turtle entangled in a net.

Unsafe water supplies have drastic effects on human health.
Waterborne diseases are diseases due to microscopic pathogens in fresh water.
These diseases can be caused by protozoa, viruses, bacteria, and intestinal parasites.
