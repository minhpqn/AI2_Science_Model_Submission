The contribution that gas makes to the total pressure when the gas is part of a mixture.
Dalton’s law of partial pressures:
The total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of all of the partial pressures of the component gases.
Define mole fraction.
Perform calculations involving mole fractions.
The changing mole fraction of sulfur dioxide is a mixed blessing
The mixed blessing of sulfur dioxide
Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of many processes, both natural and human-made.
Massive amounts of this gas are released during volcanic eruptions such as the one seen above on the Big Island (Hawaii).
Humans produce sulfur dioxide by burning coal.
The gas has a cooling effect when in the atmosphere by reflecting sunlight back away from the earth.
However, sulfur dioxide is also a component of smog and acid rain, both of which are harmful to the environment.
Many efforts have been made to reduce SO 2 levels to lower acid rain production.
An unforeseen complication: as we lower the concentration of this gas in the atmosphere, we lower its ability to cool and then we have global warming concerns.
One way to express relative amounts of substances in a mixture is with the mole fraction.
Mole fraction (X) is the ratio of moles of one substance in a mixture to the total number of moles of all substances.
For a mixture of two substances,  A and B , the mole fractions of each would be written as follows:
X_A= \frac{\text{mol} \ A}{\text{mol} \ A+\text{mol} \ B} \quad \text{and} \quad X_B=\frac{\text{mol} \ B}{\text{mol} \ A+\text{mol} \ B}
If a mixture consists of 0.50 mol  A and 1.00 mol B , then the mole fraction of  A would be X_A=\frac{0.5}{1.5} = 0.33 .  Similarly, the mole fraction of  B would be X_B =\frac{1.0}{1.5} = 0.67 .
Mole fraction is a useful quantity for analyzing gas mixtures in conjunction with Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
