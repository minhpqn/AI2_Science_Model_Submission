This type of reaction can also be represented by a general chemical equation:
Reactants + Heat → Products
Did you ever use a chemical cold pack?
The pack cools down because of an endothermic reaction.
When a tube inside the pack is broken, it releases a chemical that reacts with water inside the pack.
This reaction absorbs heat energy and quickly cools down the pack.
All chemical reactions need energy to get started.
Even reactions that release energy need a boost of energy in order to begin.
The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy .
Activation energy is like the push a child needs to start going down a playground slide.
The push gives the child enough energy to start moving, but once she starts, she keeps moving without being pushed again.
Activation energy is illustrated in Figure below .

Activation Energy.
Activation energy provides the “push” needed to start a chemical reaction.
Is the chemical reaction in this figure an exothermic or endothermic reaction?
Why do all chemical reactions need energy to get started?
In order for reactions to begin, reactant molecules must bump into each other, so they must be moving, and movement requires energy.
When reactant molecules bump together, they may repel each other because of intermolecular forces pushing them apart.
Overcoming these forces so the molecules can come together and react also takes energy.
