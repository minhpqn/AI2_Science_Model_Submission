Since period and frequency are reciprocals, the speed of the wave could also be expressed as v=\lambda f .
Example Problem:
A sound wave has a frequency of 262 Hz.  What is the time lapse between successive wave crests?
Solution:
The time lapse between successive crests would be the period and the period is the reciprocal of the frequency.
T=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{262 \ \text{s}^{-1}}=0.00382 \ \text{s}
Example Problem:
A sound wave has a frequency of 262 Hz has a wavelength of 1.29 m.  What is the velocity of the wave?
Solution: v=\lambda f=(1.29 \ \text{m})(262 \ \text{s}^{-1})=338 \ \text{m/s}
Making Waves with Sound and Light
What are the differences between sound waves and light waves?
TechTV from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology explains in these two videos:
Mechanical waves require a material medium such as water, air, or rope.
In all types of mechanical waves, energy moves from one place to another while the media carrying the wave only vibrates back and forth in position.
One type of mechanical wave is the transverse wave, in which the movement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of the energy propagation.
The maximum displacement of the medium is the distance from the undisturbed position to the top of a crest, or the amplitude.
The distance along the line of motion of the wave from equivalent positions on succeeding waves is the wavelength.
The time interval required for one entire wave to pass a point is the period.
The number of periods per second is the wave's frequency.
The period of a wave and its frequency are reciprocals of each other.
