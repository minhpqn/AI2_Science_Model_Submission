Transport of small molecules or ions across the cell membrane without an input of energy by the cell.
transport protein :
A protein that completely spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane; channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.
uniporter :
An integral membrane protein that is involved in facilitated diffusion; can be either a channel or a carrier protein.
Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes through transport proteins in the plasma membrane.
Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.

Compare and contrast simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion.
For each type of diffusion, give an example of a molecule that is transported.
Explain the three types of transport proteins involved in facilitated diffusion.
Active Transport - Advanced
Compare passive and active transport.
Explain how different types of active transport occur.
Need to move something really heavy?
If you did, it would take a lot of energy.
Sometimes, moving things into or out of the cell also takes energy.
How would the cell move something against a concentration gradient?
It starts by using energy.
