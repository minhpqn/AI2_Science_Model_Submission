Thinking Like a Scientist
A scientist is always trying to find the truth and discover new truths.
How can you think like a scientist?
Thinking like a scientist is based on asking and answering questions.
Though you may not know it, you do this all day long.
Scientists ask questions, and then make detailed observations to try to ask more specific questions and develop a hypothesis .
They may design and perform an experiment to try to answer their question and test their hypothesis.
From the results of their experiment, scientists draw conclusions .
A conclusion describes what the evidence tells the scientist.
Scientists ask questions :
The key to being a great scientist is to ask questions.
Imagine you are a scientist in the African Congo.
While in the field, you observe one group of healthy chimpanzees on the north side of the jungle.
On the other side of the jungle, you find a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying.
What questions might you ask?
A good scientist might ask the following two questions:
"What differs between the two environments where the chimpanzees live?"
"Are there differences in behavior between the two groups of chimpanzees?"
Scientists make detailed observations :
To observe means to watch and study attentively.
