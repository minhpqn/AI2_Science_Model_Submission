The more rapid motion means that the solvent molecules collide with the solute with greater frequency and the collisions occur with more force.
Both factors increase the rate at which the solute dissolves.
As we will see in the next section, a temperature change not only affects the rate of dissolving, but also affects the amount of solute that dissolves.
The rate of dissolving is influenced by surface area, stirring, and temperature.
