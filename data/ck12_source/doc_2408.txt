For example, the volume of a rectangular room can be calculated with the formula:
Volume = length × width × height
If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the room is:
Volume = 5.0 m × 3.0 m × 2.5 m = 37.5 m 3
Q:
What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above?
A:
The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL.
The volume of the water and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL.
Therefore, the volume of the dinosaur alone is 5.6 mL – 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL.
Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe.

Mass measures the amount of matter in a substance or an object.
The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg).
Volume measures the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up.
The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m 3 ).
