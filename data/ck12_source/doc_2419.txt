Do you know properties of any other elements?
For example, what do you know about helium?
A:
Helium is a gas that has a lower density than air.
That’s why helium balloons have to be weighted down so they won’t float away.
Q:
Living things, like all matter, are made of elements.
Do you know which element is most common in living things?
A:
Carbon is the most common element in living things.
It has the unique property of being able to combine with many other elements as well as with itself.
This allows carbon to form a huge number of different substances.
History of Elements
For thousands of years, people have wondered about the substances that make up matter.
About 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that all matter is made up of just four elements, which he identified as earth, air, water, and fire.
He thought that different substances vary in their properties because they contain different proportions of these four elements.
Aristotle had the right idea, but he was wrong about which substances are elements.
Nonetheless, his four elements were accepted until just a few hundred years ago.
Then scientists started discovering many of the elements with which we are familiar today.
Eventually they discovered dozens of different elements.
