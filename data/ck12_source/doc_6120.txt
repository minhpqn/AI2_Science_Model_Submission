In a gas mixture containing equal numbers of moles of two gases, what can you say about the partial pressures of each gas?
Mole fraction (X) :
The ratio of moles of one substance in a mixture to the total number of moles of all substances.
Gas Collection by Water Displacement
Calculate volumes of dry gases obtained after collecting over water.
The pressure of gases collected over water can be determined by using the atmospheric pressure in the room
What is the pressure?
You need to do a lab experiment where hydrogen gas is generated.
In order to calculate the yield of gas, you have to know the pressure inside the tube where the gas is collected.
But how can you get a barometer in there?
Very simple: you donâ€™t.
All you need is the atmospheric pressure in the room.
As the gas pushed out the water, it is pushing against the atmosphere, so the pressure inside is equal to the pressure outside.
Gas Collection by Water Displacement
Gases that are produced in laboratory experiments are often collected by a technique called water displacement (see Figure below ).
A bottle is filled with water and placed upside-down in a pan of water.
The reaction flask is fitted with rubber tubing which is then fed under the bottle of water.
As the gas is produced in the reaction flask, it exits through the rubber tubing and displaces the water in the bottle.
When the bottle is full of the gas, it can be sealed with a lid.
A gas produced in a chemical reaction can be collected by water displacement.
