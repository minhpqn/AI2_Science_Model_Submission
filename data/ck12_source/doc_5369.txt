A three base sequence on the tRNA molecule complementary to the codon on the mRNA.
codon :
A sequence of three nucleotides within mRNA; encodes for a specific amino acid or termination (stop) sequence.
genetic code :
The universal code of three-base codons; encodes the genetic instructions for the amino acid sequence of proteins.
frameshift mutation :
Mutations which alter the mRNA reading frame.
inosine :
A purine nucleoside containing the base hypoxanthine and the sugar ribose; occurs in tRNAs.
mutation :
A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA or RNA.
reading frame :
The frame of three bases (codon) in which the mRNA is translated.
start codon :
Codon that begins translation;
AUG.
stop codon :
A codon that does not have a corresponding tRNA (does not code for an amino acid); signals the end of translation; also known as a termination codon;
UAG, UGA, and UAA.
translation :
