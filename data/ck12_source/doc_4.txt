Scientists question the answers :
Good scientists are skeptical.
Scientists never use only one piece of evidence to form a conclusion.
For example, the chimpanzees in the experiment may have died from a lack of food, but can you think of another explanation for their death?
They may have died from a virus, or from another less obvious cause.
More experiments need to be completed before scientists can be sure.
Science is about finding the truth, no matter what.
So good scientists constantly question their own conclusions.
They also find other scientists to confirm or disagree with their evidence.
Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world, based on observable evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing.
To think like a scientist, you must ask questions, make detailed observations, develop a hypothesis, find answers using tests, and question your answers.
