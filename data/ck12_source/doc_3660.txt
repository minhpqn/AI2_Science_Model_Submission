One copy comes from each parent.
The gene for a characteristic may have different versions, but the different versions are always at the same locus.
The different versions are called alleles .
For example, in pea plants, there is a purple-flower allele ( B ) and a white-flower allele ( b ).
Different alleles account for much of the variation in the characteristics of organisms.
Chromosome, Gene, Locus, Allele
Chromosome, Gene, Locus, and Allele.
This diagram shows how the concepts of chromosome, gene, locus, and allele are related.
What is the different between a gene and a locus?
Between a gene and an allele?
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different gametes.
Thus, the two alleles for each gene also go to different gametes.
At the same time, different chromosomes assort independently.
As a result, alleles for different genes assort independently as well.
In these ways, alleles are shuffled and recombined in each parent’s gametes.
Genotype and Phenotype
When gametes unite during fertilization, the resulting zygote inherits two alleles for each gene.
One allele comes from each parent.
The alleles an individual inherits make up the individual’s genotype .
The two alleles may be the same or different.
