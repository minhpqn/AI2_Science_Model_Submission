If only part of the Sun is out of view, it is a partial solar eclipse.
Solar eclipses are rare events.
They usually only last a few minutes.
That is because the Moonâ€™s shadow only covers a very small area on Earth, and Earth is turning very rapidly.
Solar eclipses are amazing to experience.
The light disappears so that it's like night, only strange.
Birds may sing as they do at dusk.
Stars become visible in the sky.
It gets colder outside.
Unlike at night, though, the Sun is out.
So during a solar eclipse, it's easy to see the Sun's corona and solar prominences.
This NASA page will inform you on when solar eclipses are expected:
