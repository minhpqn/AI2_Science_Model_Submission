Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in both animal and plant cells and it serves different functions in each.
The SER is made up of tubules and vesicles that branch out to form a network.
In some cells there are dilated areas like the sacs of RER.
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum and RER form an interconnected network.
Nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus
Image of nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and how they work together.
The process of secretion from endoplasmic reticuli to Golgi apparatus is shown.
The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae, as shown in Figure above .
The cisternae look a bit like a stack of deflated balloons.
The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell.
The Golgi apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell, where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER.
It is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell.
Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell.
The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels "items" and then sends them to different parts of the cell.
Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus.
Plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks scattered throughout the cytoplasm.
In plants, the Golgi apparatus contains enzymes that synthesize some of the cell wall polysaccharides.
A vesicle is a small, spherical compartment that is separated from the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer.
Many vesicles are made in the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, or are made from parts of the cell membrane.
Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in Figure above .
