Define Avogadro’s number.
It is often convenient to have a unit for large amounts, such as a mole
Is there an easier way to load this truck?
When the weather is nice, many people begin to work on their yards and homes.
For many projects, sand is needed as a foundation for a walk or to add to other materials.
You could order up twenty million grains of sand and have people really stare at you.
You could order by the pound, but that takes a lot of time weighing out.
The best bet is to order by the yard, meaning a cubic yard.
The loader can easily scoop up what you need and put it directly in your truck.
It certainly is easy to count bananas or to count elephants (as long as you stay out of their way).
However, you would be counting grains of sugar from your sugar canister for a long, long time.
Atoms and molecules are extremely small – far, far smaller than grains of sugar.
Counting atoms or molecules is not only unwise, it is absolutely impossible.
One drop of water contains about 10 22 molecules of water.
If you counted 10 molecules every second for 50 years without stopping you would have counted only 1.6 × 10 10 molecules.
Put another way, at that counting rate, it would take you over 30 trillion years to count the water molecules in one tiny drop.
Chemists needed a name that can stand for a very large number of items.
Amedeo Avogadro (1776 - 1856), an Italian scientist, provided just such a number.
He is responsible for the counting unit of measure called the mole.
A mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains 6.02 × 10 23 representative particles of that substance.
