Thatâ€™s in our food?
Bacterial contamination in our food often makes the news.
There are many bacteria present on raw food, especially raw meat.
Campylobacter (pictured above), salmonella, and other microorganisms can be found, even after cooking if the meat has not been sufficiently exposed to the heat.
Ionizing radiation can be used to disrupt the DNA-RNA-protein synthesis cycle that allows the bacteria to reproduce.
Cobalt-60 is a common radiation source, as is cesium-137.
But, just to be safe, order that burger well-done.
Effects of Radiation
In order to better understand how cellular radiation damage occurs, we need to take a quick review of how the cell functions.
DNA in the nucleus is responsible for protein synthesis and for regulation of many cellular functions.
In the process of protein synthesis, DNA partially unfolds to produce messenger RNA (mRNA).
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and interacts with ribosomes, transfer RNA, amino acids, and other cellular constituents in the cytoplasm.
Through a complex series of reactions, proteins are produced to carry out a number of specialized processes within the organism.
Anything that disturbs this flow of reactions can produce damage to the cell.

The major effect of ionizing radiation on the cell is the disruption of the DNA strand.
With the DNA structure damaged, the cell cannot reproduce in its normal fashion.
Protein synthesis is affected, as are a number of processes necessary for proper cell function.
One common effect is the generation of cancer cells.
