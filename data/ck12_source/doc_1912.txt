Only a tiny percentage of carbon atoms are carbon-14. carbon-14 is unstable.
It is a radioactive isotope of carbon.
Pictured below is carbon dioxide ( Figure below ), which forms in the atmosphere from carbon-14 and oxygen.
Neutrons in cosmic rays strike nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere.
The nitrogen forms carbon-14.
Carbon in the atmosphere combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide.
Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.
In this way, carbon-14 enters food chains.
Structure of carbon dioxide
Carbon-14 forms in the atmosphere.
It combines with oxygen and forms carbon dioxide.
How does carbon-14 end up in fossils?
Decay of Unstable Isotopes
Like other unstable isotopes, carbon-14 breaks down, or decays.
The original atoms are called the parent isotopes .
For carbon-14 decay, each carbon-14 atom loses an beta particle.
It changes to a stable atom of nitrogen-14.
The stable atom at the end is the daughter product ( Figure below ).
Diagram of Carbon 14 beta decay
Unstable isotopes, such as carbon-14, decay by losing atomic particles.
