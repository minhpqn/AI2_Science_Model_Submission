Primary succession, volcanic eruption being colonized by pioneer species
Primary Succession.
New land from a volcanic eruption is slowly being colonized by a pioneer species.
Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed.
The disturbance could be a fire, flood, or human action such as farming.
This type of succession is faster because the soil is already in place.
In this case, the pioneer species are plants such as grasses, birch trees, and fireweed.
Organic matter from the pioneer species improves the soil.
This lets other plants move into the area.
An example of this type of succession is shown in Figure below .
Secondary succession, plants growing after a forest fire
Secondary Succession.
Two months after a forest fire, new plants are already sprouting among the charred logs.
Many early ecologists thought that a community always goes through the same series of stages during succession.
They also assumed that succession always ends with a final stable stage.
They called this stage the climax community .
Today, most ecologists no longer hold these views.
They believe that continued change is normal in most ecosystems.
They think that most communities are disturbed too often to become climax communities.
Ecological succession is the process in which a community changes through time.
