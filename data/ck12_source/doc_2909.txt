There is always a 50-50 chance that a coin will land on heads.
Half the time it will land on heads and half the time it will land on tails.
What is the chance of it landing heads twice in a row?
Or three times?
These rules of probability also apply to genetics.
A parent only gives one factor for each trait to an offspring.
If a parent has one dominant and one recessive factor for a trait, then, on average, half the time the dominant factor will be passed on, and half the time the recessive factor will be passed on.
Probability and Punnett Squares
A Punnett square is a special tool derived from the laws of probability.
It is used to predict the possible offspring from a cross, or mating between two parents.
An example of a Punnett square ( Figure below ) shows the results of a cross between two purple flowers that each have one dominant factor and one recessive factor ( Bb ).
The Punnett square of a cross between two heterozygous purple flowers
The Punnett square of a cross between two purple flowers ( Bb ).
A Punnett square can be used to calculate what percentage of offspring will have a certain trait.
To create a Punnett square, perform the following steps:
Take the factors from the first parent and place them at the top of the square ( B and b ).
Take the factors from the second parent and line them up on the left side of the square ( B and b ).
Pull the factors from the top into the boxes below.
Pull the factors from the side into the boxes next to them.
The possible offspring are represented by the letters in the boxes, with one factor coming from each parent.
