Without it, Earth would be a harsh, barren world.
Why the Atmosphere Is Important
We are lucky to have an atmosphere on Earth.
The atmosphere supports life and is also needed for the water cycle and weather.
The gases of the atmosphere even allow us to hear.
The Atmosphere and Living Things
Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen, but it doesn't do much.
Carbon dioxide and oxygen are the gases in the atmosphere that are needed for life.
Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis .
They use sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water into food.
The process releases oxygen.
Without photosynthesis, there would be very little oxygen in the air.
Other living things depend on plants for food.
These organisms need the oxygen plants release to get energy out of the food.
Even plants need oxygen for this purpose.
The Atmosphere and the Sun’s Rays
The atmosphere protects living things from the Sun’s most harmful rays.
Gases reflect or absorb the strongest rays of sunlight ( Figure below ).
The atmosphere shields Earth from the most harmful solar rays
