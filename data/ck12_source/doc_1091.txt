Studying the Seafloor
Scuba divers can only dive to about 40 meters.
When they dive deep, they cannot stay down for very long.
Therefore, scuba divers can only observe the organisms and ecosystems very near a coast.
Most oceanic research requires accessing greater depths.
How do scientists create bathymetric maps?
Early explorers mapped the seafloor by painstakingly dropping a line over the side of a ship.
They measured the length of the line when it touched bottom.
With this method, they could measure the depth, one tiny spot at a time.
During World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders .
Echo sounders were developed to locate enemy submarines.
Early echo sounders had a single beam.
The beam bounced off the nearest object and then returned to the ship.
Scientists know the speed of sound in seawater.
They can then calculate the distance to the object based on the time it takes for the wave to make a round trip.
This allowed them to create a line of depth measurements.
Modern echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions ( Figure below ).
An echo sounder creates a 3D map of the seafloor
This echo sounder has many beams and creates a three dimensional map of the seafloor.
Topographic maps that show water depths are called bathymetric maps .
