They are even found in rocks deep below Earth’s surface.
Any surface that has not been sterilized is likely to be covered with bacteria.
The total number of bacteria in the world is amazing.
It’s estimated to be 5 × 10 30 , or five million trillion.
You have more bacteria in and on your body than you have body cells!
Bacteria called cyanobacteria are very important.
They are bluish green in color (see Figure below ) because they contain chlorophyll (but not chloroplasts, of course).
They make food through photosynthesis and release oxygen into the air.
These bacteria were probably responsible for adding oxygen to the air on early Earth.
This changed the planet’s atmosphere.
It also changed the direction of evolution.
Ancient cyanobacteria also may have evolved into the chloroplasts of plant cells.
Cyanobacteria can bloom in bodies of water
Cyanobacteria Bloom.
The green streaks in this lake consist of trillions of cyanobacteria.
Excessive nutrients in the water led to overgrowth of the bacteria.
Thousands of species of bacteria have been discovered, and many more are thought to exist.
The known species can be classified on the basis of various traits.
One classification is based on differences in their cell walls and outer membranes.
It groups bacteria into Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as described in Figure below .
