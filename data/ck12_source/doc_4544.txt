Systemic circulation is the part of the circulatory system that carries blood between the heart and body.
It is illustrated in Figure below .
Oxygenated blood leaves the left ventricle through the aorta.
The aorta and other arteries transport the blood throughout the body, where it gives up oxygen and picks up carbon dioxide.
The deoxygenated blood then returns to the right atrium through veins.
