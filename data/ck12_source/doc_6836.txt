Where do pearls come from?
Pearls are highly valued as gemstones.
Most gemstones come from the Earth, but pearls come from living things.
They are created by mollusks, such as oysters.
Importance of Mollusks
Mollusks are important in a variety of ways; they are used as food, for decoration, in jewelry, and in scientific studies.
They are even used as roadbed material and in vitamin supplements.
Mollusks as Food
Edible species of mollusks include numerous species of clams, mussels, oysters, scallops, marine and land snails, squid, and octopuses.
Many species of mollusks, such as oysters , are farmed in order to produce more than could be found in the wild ( Figure below ).

Today, fisheries in Europe, Japan, and the US alone produce over 1 billion pounds of oyster meat each year.
Abalone (a marine gastropod mollusk), a great delicacy, can fetch up to three hundred dollars per pound.
Eating mollusks is associated with a risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and many countries have regulations to reduce this risk.
At certain times of the year, (usually the warmer months) many species of saltwater mollusks become very poisonous due to an algal bloom known as "red tide." The mollusks filter feed on the tiny creatures (called dinoflagellates in the bloom) that produce the toxins.
