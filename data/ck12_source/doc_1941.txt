How do geologists know that there were two transgressions and regressions in the Mesozoic?
Mesozoic Plate Tectonics
Describe Mesozoic plate tectonics.
Why would a supercontinent break up?
A continent is like a giant blanket that traps heat.
Heat from the mantle comes up but cannot escape through the continent.
This image shows hot material beneath New Mexico.
The heat is trapped beneath the North American plate.
The hot material is causing rifting to begin.
This is known as the Rio Grande Rift.
Why would a supercontinent break up?
Remember that Earth's interior is hot.
Heat builds up beneath the supercontinent.
This causes the continent to buoy upward.
Continental rifting begins.
Basalt lava fills in the rift.
This could lead to seafloor spreading and the formation of a new ocean basin.
This basalt province is where Africa is splitting apart and generating basalt lava. ( Figure below )

In the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Africa is splitting apart.
