Gas exchange in the lungs takes place across the thin walls of pulmonary arteries in tiny air sacs called alveoli.
Oxygenated blood is transported by the circulatory system from lungs to tissues throughout the body.
Gas exchange between blood and body cells occurs across the walls of peripheral capillaries.
Gas exchange helps maintain homeostasis by supplying cells with oxygen, carrying away carbon dioxide waste, and maintaining proper pH of the blood.
