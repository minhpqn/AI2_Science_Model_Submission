Various ways of recording recipes have developed over the centuries.
The cookbook shown above was written by a woman who probably collected all her own recipes.
Later, printed cookbooks became available (even guys had no excuse for not being able to cook).
Today we can find recipes on a number of internet sites and can quickly search for information on how to cook anything we want.
Reading a recipe sometimes requires we understand a few codes and symbols (what’s the difference between a tsp and a Tsp?), but the information on what we start with and what we end up with is there.
Writing Chemical Equations
Chemical reactions are occurring all around you.
Plants use sunlight to drive their photosynthetic process and produce energy.
Cars and other vehicles burn gasoline in order to power their engines.
Batteries use electrochemical reactions to produce energy and power many everyday devices.
Many chemical reactions are going on inside you as well, especially during the digestion of food.
In math class, you have written and solved many mathematical equations.
Chemists keep track of chemical reactions by writing equations as well.
In any chemical reaction one or more substances, called reactants , are converted into one or more new substances, called products .
The general form of the equation for such a process looks like this.
\text{Reactants} \rightarrow \text{Products}
Unlike in a math equation, a chemical equation does not use an equal sign.
