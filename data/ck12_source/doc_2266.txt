The red-yellow galaxy at the center of this image is an elliptical galaxy
The large, reddish-yellow object in the middle of this figure is a typical elliptical galaxy.
Can you find other galaxies in the figure?
What kind?
Irregular Galaxies and Dwarf Galaxies
Look at the galaxy pictured below ( Figure below ).
Do you think this is a spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy?
It is neither one!
Galaxies that are not clearly elliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies are called irregular galaxies .
Most irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies.
They were then deformed either by gravitational attraction to a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy.
This galaxy is an irregular galaxy that is neither spiral nor elliptical
This galaxy, called NGC 1427A, is an irregular galaxy.
It has neither a spiral nor an elliptical shape.
Dwarf galaxies are small galaxies containing “only” a few million to a few billion stars.
Most dwarf galaxies are irregular in shape.
However, there are also dwarf elliptical galaxies and dwarf spiral galaxies .
Dwarf galaxies are the most common type in the Universe.
However, because they are relatively small and dim, we don’t see as many dwarf galaxies as we do their full-sized cousins.
A galaxy is composed of millions to billions of stars.
