Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.
Explain the role of phospholipids in the cell membranes of living things.
You’ve probably seen dozens of nutrition facts labels like the one in the opening image.
The labels show the nutrients that foods contain.
Many people read nutrition facts labels to see how much fat there is in particular foods.
That’s because eating too much fat, especially saturated fat, can be unhealthy and contribute to weight gain.
Fats are a type of biochemical compound called lipids.
What Are Lipids?
Lipids are one of four classes of biochemical compounds, which are compounds that make up living things and carry out life processes. (The other three classes of biochemical compounds are carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids.) Living things use lipids to store energy.
Lipids are also the major components of cell membranes in living things.
Types of lipids include fats and oils.
Fats are solid lipids that animals use to store energy.
Oils are liquid lipids that plants use to store energy.
Q:
Can you name some lipids that are fats?
What are some lipids that are oils?
A:
Lipids that are fats include butter and the fats in meats.
Lipids that are oils include olive oil and vegetable oil.
Examples of both types of lipids are pictured in the Figure below .
