It controls the size of the pupil.
The lens of the eye is a convex lens.
It fine-tunes the focus so an image forms on the retina at the back of the eye.
Tiny muscles control the shape of the lens to focus images of close or distant objects.
The retina is a membrane lining the back of the eye.
The retina has nerve cells called rods and cones that change images to electrical signals.
Rods are good at sensing dim light but canâ€™t distinguish different colors of light.
Cones can sense colors but not dim light.
There are three different types of cones.
Each type senses one of the three primary colors of light (red, green, or blue).
The optic nerve carries electrical signals from the rods and cones to the brain.
Q:
The lens of the eye is a convex lens.
How would vision be affected if the lens of the eye was concave instead of convex?
A:
A concave lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread apart.
It forms a virtual image on the same side of the lens at the object being viewed.
Therefore, a concave lens would focus the image in front of the eye, not on the retina inside the eye.
No signals would be sent to the brain so vision would not be possible.
