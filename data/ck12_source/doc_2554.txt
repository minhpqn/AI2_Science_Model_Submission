How many electrons can the fourth energy level have?
How many orbitals are there at this energy level?
An atom of sodium has 11 electrons.
Make a sketch of a sodium atom, showing how many electrons it has at each energy level.
Infer how reactive sodium atoms are.
Electron Cloud Atomic Model
State the main limitation of Bohr’s atomic model.
Describe Schrödinger’s work and atomic orbitals.
Identify the electron cloud model of the atom.
The fan pictured here is turned off in the photo on the left and running at high speed in the photo on the right.
In the right-hand photo, the blades are moving too fast for you to see the individual blades.
You can’t tell where any given blade is at any given moment.
In some ways, rapidly moving fan blades are similar to electrons moving about the nucleus of an atom.
Like fan blades, electrons move very quickly and we can never tell exactly where they are.
If that’s the case, how can we represent electrons in models of the atom?
Where Are the Electrons?
Up until about 1920, scientists accepted Niels Bohr’s model of the atom.
In this model, negative electrons circle the positive nucleus at fixed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels.
You can see the model in Figure below for an atom of the element nitrogen.
Bohr’s model is useful for understanding properties of elements and their chemical interactions.
