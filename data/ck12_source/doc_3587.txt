What is produced in step 10?
How many ATPs are used and produced during glycolysis?
Glycolysis at  .
What is glycolysis?
Describe what happens during glycolysis.
How many ATP and NADH molecules are gained during this stage?
Defend this statement: ‘‘Glycolysis is a universal and ancient pathway for making ATP’’.
Summarize the Krebs cycle
Identify the products of the Krebs cycle.
What type of acid do these fruits contain?
Citric acid.
Citric acid is also the first product formed in the Krebs cycle, and therefore this acid occurs in the metabolism of virtually all living things.
Cellular Respiration Stage II:
The Krebs Cycle
Recall that glycolysis, stage I of cellular respiration, produces two molecules of pyruvate.
These molecules enter the matrix of a mitochondrion, where they start the Krebs cycle .
The reactions that occur next are shown in Figure below .

Steps of the Krebs Cycle
The Krebs cycle starts with pyruvic acid from glycolysis.
