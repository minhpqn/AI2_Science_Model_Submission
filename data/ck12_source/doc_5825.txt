In this method, a piece of the mycelium, the body of the fungus, splits off.
The resulting fragment can eventually produce a new colony of fungi.
Yeast reproduce asexually by budding
Yeast reproduce asexually by budding.
Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction.
This form of reproduction is controlled by many different factors.
Outside conditions, such as the availability of food, determine when a fungus undergoes asexual reproduction.
Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually.
But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker?
Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents.
This increases the genetic diversity of the species.
In plants and animals, sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new individual.
In fungi, however, two haploid hyphae meet together and their nuclei fuse.
Instead of calling a hyphae male or female, they have different mating types, such as (+) and (-) ( Figure below ).
The common mushroom, a fruiting body, results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae mate
The common mushroom, a fruiting body, results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae, one (+) and one (-), mate, forming a mycelium with sporangia.
Notice, when the sporangia burst, the spores are released from the fruiting body.
Fungi can reproduce asexually by spores, budding, or fragmentation.
Fungi can reproduce sexually to create a zygospore.
