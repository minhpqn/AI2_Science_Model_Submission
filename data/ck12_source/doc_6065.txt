Each sphere represents an atom or an ion.
In the simple cubic system, the atoms or ions are at the corners of the unit cell only.
In the face-centered unit cell, there are also atoms or ions in the center of each of the six faces of the unit cell.
In the body-centered unit cell, there is one atom or ion in the center of the unit cell in addition to the corner atoms or ions.
Pay special attention to the last diagram for each type of cell.
You will notice that the atoms or ions at the edges of each face or at the corners are not complete spheres.
In the simple cubic cell, each corner atom is shared by 8 differenent unit cells.
The same situation exists for the edge or corner particles in the face-centered and body-centered cubic forms.
In addition, each of the particles in the center of the face-centered cubic cell is shared by 2 unit cells.
Body-centered cells have an additional atom in the middle of the cell which is contained entirely in that cell.
Note that we have only considered the unit cells of a cubic crystal.
Other crystal forms also have unit cells.
These unit cells are listed below:
rhombohedral, hexagonal, triclinic – one unique form each
tetragonal – simple and body-centered
monoclinic – simple and base-centered
orthorhombic – simple, face-centered, body-centered, base-centered
A unit cell is the smallest portion of a crystal lattice that shows the three-dimensional pattern of the entire crystal.
There are three different types of unit cells in the cubic crystal system.
