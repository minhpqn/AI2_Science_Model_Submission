Then, moles is converted to grams.
Step 2:
Solve.
\text{mol KMnO}_4 = 0.250 \text{ M KMnO}_4 \times 3.00 \text{ L} &= 0.750 \text{ mol KMnO}_4\\0.750 \text{ mol KMnO}_4 \times \frac{158.04 \text{ g KMnO}_4}{1 \text{ mol KMnO}_4} &=119 \text{ g KMnO}_4
Step 3:
Think about your result.
When 119 g of potassium permanganate is dissolved into water to make 3.00 L of solution, the molarity is 0.250 M.

Calculations using the concept of molarity are described.
Read the material and work the problems at the site below:
What does M stand for?
What does molarity tell us that percent solution information does not tell us?
What do we need to know about a molecule in order to carry out molarity calculations?
molarity (M):
The number of moles of solute dissolved in one liter of solution.
Describe the process for preparing solutions.
Precision is very important in chemistry
How much water do I add?
Back in the “good old days” (whenever that really was), many cooks didn’t bother with careful measurements.
