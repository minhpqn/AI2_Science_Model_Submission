Why does steam form over the hot spring pictured above?
A:
Steam forms when some of the water vapor from the boiling water cools in the air and condenses to form droplets of liquid water.
Vaporization vs.
Evaporation
Vaporization is easily confused with evaporation, but the two processes are not the same.
Evaporation also changes a liquid to a gas, but it doesn’t involve boiling.
Instead, evaporation occurs when particles at the surface of a liquid gain enough energy to escape into the air.
This happens without the liquid becoming hot enough to boil.
The temperature at which a substance boils and changes to a gas is called its boiling point.
Boiling point is a physical property of matter.
The boiling point of pure water is 100°C.
Other substances may have higher or lower boiling points.
Several examples are listed in the Table below .
Pure water is included in the table for comparison.

Q:
Assume you want to get the salt (sodium chloride) out of salt water.
Based on information in the table, how could you do it?
