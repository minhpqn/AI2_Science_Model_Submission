This animation shows porosity and permeability: .
The water droplets are found in the pores between the sediment grains.
This is porosity.
When the water can travel between pores, that’s permeability.
The diagram below ( Figure below ) shows two layers of porous rock.
The top layer is not saturated; it is not full of water.
The next layer is saturated.
The water in this layer has nowhere else to go.
It cannot seep any deeper into the ground because the rock below it is impermeable.
Diagram of an aquifer
Water seeps into the ground through permeable material.
The water stops when it reaches an impermeable rock.
Predict the purpose of the well in the diagram.
The Water Table
The top of the saturated rock layer above ( Figure above ) is called the water table .
The water table isn’t like a real table.
It doesn’t remain firmly in one place.
Instead, it rises or falls, depending on how much water seeps down from the surface.
The water table is higher when there is a lot of rain, and it is lower when the weather is dry.
Water infiltrates into the ground.
