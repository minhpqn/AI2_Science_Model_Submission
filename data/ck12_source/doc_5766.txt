This protects the filament and keeps the glass blub free of deposits.
Argon is used in incandescent lightbulbs
Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below .
Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them.
When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level.
When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light.
Different noble gases give off light of different colors.
Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below.
Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.
Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table.
Noble gases are the least reactive of all elements.
That’s because they have eight valence electrons, which fill their outer energy level.
This is the most stable arrangement of electrons, so noble gases rarely react with other elements and form compounds.
The octet rule states that atoms react to form compounds that allow them to have eight valence electrons like the noble gases, which are the least reactive elements.
Noble gases are used for balloons, light bulbs, and lighted signs.
Watch the video about noble gases at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.
Compare and contrast the reactivity of the elements helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon.
Compare the density of these noble gases to the density of air.
Describe how the mass of noble gases changes from the top to the bottom of group 18.
