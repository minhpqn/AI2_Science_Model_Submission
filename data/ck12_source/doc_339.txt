Functions of Bones
Your skeletal system gives shape and form to your body, but it also plays other important roles.
The main functions of the skeletal system include:
Support.
The skeleton supports the body against the pull of gravity, meaning you don't fall over when you stand up.
The large bones of the lower limbs support the rest of the body when standing.
Protection.
The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body.
For example, the skull surrounds the brain to protect it from injury.
The bones of the rib cage help protect the heart and lungs.
Movement.
Bones work together with muscles to move the body.
Making blood cells.
Blood cells are mostly made inside certain types of bones.
Storage.
Bones store calcium.
They contain more calcium than any other organ.
Calcium is released by the bones when blood levels of calcium drop too low.
