Electromagnetic waves transfer energy across space as well as through matter.
They vary in their wavelengths and frequencies, and higher-frequency waves have more energy.
The full range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves, shown in the Figure below , is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
Gamma rays lie at the far end of the electromagnetic spectrum
What Are Gamma Rays?
As you can see in the Figure above , gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves.
Their wavelengths are shorter than the diameter of atomic nuclei, and their frequencies are greater than 1019 hertz (Hz).
That’s 10 quadrillion waves per second!
Because of their high frequencies, gamma rays are also the most energetic of all electromagnetic waves.

Sources of Gamma Rays
Gamma rays are given off by radioactive atoms and nuclear explosions.
They are also given off by the sun and other stars, as well as by collapsing stars in gamma ray bursts.
Fortunately, gamma rays from space are absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere before they can reach the surface.
Q:
Predict how gamma rays might affect living things on Earth if they weren’t absorbed by the atmosphere.
A:
Gamma rays would destroy most living things on Earth because they have so much energy.
