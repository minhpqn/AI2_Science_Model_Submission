Describe in specific terms Mendel’s first set of experiments.
What is a true-breeding plant?
How did the appearance of Mendel’s F 1 generation differ from the appearance of the P generation?
Assume you are investigating the inheritance of stem length in pea plants.
You cross-pollinate a short-stemmed plant with a long-stemmed plant.
All of the offspring have long stems.
Then, you let the offspring self-pollinate.
Describe the stem lengths you would expect to find in the second generation of offspring.
Theory of Heredity - Advanced
Identify the actions of dominant alleles and recessive alleles for a trait.
Outline the Law of Segregation.
Do you look like your parents?
What about if you're a lion, or dog or pea plant?
Do you look like your parents?
You probably have some traits in common with each of your parents.
Mendel's work provided the basis to understand the passing of traits from one generation to the next, which is heredity.
Mendel's Theory of Heredity
Based on his observations, Mendel developed four hypotheses.
These hypotheses are known as Mendel’s theory of heredity.
The hypotheses explain a simple form of inheritance in which two alleles of a gene are inherited to result in one of several traits in offspring.
