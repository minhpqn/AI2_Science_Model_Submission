The United Nations and the U.S.
Census Bureau predict that by 2050, the Earth will be populated by 9.4 billion people.
Other estimates predict 10 to 11 billion.
There are two different beliefs about what type of growth the human population will undergo in the future:
Neo-Malthusians believe that human population growth cannot continue without destroying the environment, and maybe humans themselves.
Cornucopians believe that the Earth can give humans a limitless amount of resources.
They also believe that technology can solve problems caused by limited resources, such as lack of food.
The Cornucopians believe that a larger population is good for technology and innovation.
The 5-stage model above predicts that when all countries are industrialized, the human population will eventually level out.
But many scientists and other Neo-Malthusians believe that humans have already gone over the Earthâ€™s carrying capacity .
That means, we may have already reached the maximum population size that can be supported, without destroying our resources and habitat.
If this is true, then human overpopulation will lead to a lack of food and other resources.
Overpopulation may also lead to increased disease, and/or war.
These problems may cause the population of humans to crash.
If these issues are not controlled, could the human population go extinct?
Which of the above theories makes sense to you?
Why?
The human population is undergoing exponential growth.
Future outlooks on human population growth differ; some think we will have a limitless amount of resources, while others think we have already reached our carrying capacity.
