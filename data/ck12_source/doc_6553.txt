Polyethylene glycol being poured into a radiator
How cold can it get?
Water freezes at 0°C which creates problems for cars in the winter.
The water in the engine would freeze and crack the engine block.
To prevent this, antifreeze is added to lower the freezing point of the liquid.
The most common antifreeze is an alcohol known as propylene glycol.
It has largely replaced the much more toxic ethylene glycol.
Methanol can also be used as an antifreeze, mainly in windshield wiper fluid.
An alcohol is an organic compound that contains one or more hydroxyl (−OH) groups.
The general formula for alcohols is R−OH.
Do not confuse alcohols with inorganic bases that contain the hydroxide ion (OH − ).
The –OH group in an alcohol is covalently bonded to a carbon atom and does not ionize in solution.
The steps for naming alcohols are listed below.
Name the parent compound by finding the longest continuous carbon atom chain that also contains the hydroxyl group.
If there is one hydroxyl group in the molecule, change the final – e in the name of the alkane to – ol .
If there is more than one hydroxyl group, use the full name of the alkane and add a suffix to indicate the number of hydroxyl groups.
For example, two hydroxyl groups is – diol , three is – triol , etc.
Number the carbon chain in a way that makes the sum of hydroxyl numbers as low as possible.
Add the numerical prefix into the name before the name of the alcohol.
Separate numbers with commas and separate numbers from names or prefixes with a hyphen.
