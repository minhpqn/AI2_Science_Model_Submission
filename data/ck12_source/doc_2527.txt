Some carbon atoms have 8 neutrons.
What is the name of this isotope of carbon?
A:
Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons have an atomic mass of 14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons = 14), so this isotope of carbon is named carbon-14.
Stability of Isotopes
Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus.
Having too many or too few neutrons relative to protons results in an unstable, or radioactive, nucleus that will sooner or later break down to a more stable form.
This process is called radioactive decay.
Many isotopes have radioactive nuclei, and these isotopes are referred to as radioisotopes.
When they decay, they release particles that may be harmful.
This is why radioactive isotopes are dangerous and why working with them requires special suits for protection.
The isotope of carbon known as carbon-14 is an example of a radioisotope.
In contrast, the carbon isotopes called carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable.
Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties because they have the same numbers of protons and electrons.
Most hydrogen atoms lack a neutron and are just called hydrogen.
Hydrogen atoms with one neutron are the isotope known as deuterium, and those with two neutrons are the isotope named tritium.
For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number, which is the number of protons plus neutrons.
For example, carbon with a mass number of 14 is called carbon-14.
Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus.
