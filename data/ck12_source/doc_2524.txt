For example, positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions react to form the neutral compound sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt.
This occurs because oppositely charged ions attract each other.
Ions with the same charge, on the other hand, repel each other.
Ions are also deflected by a magnetic field, as you saw in the opening image of the northern lights.
Atoms have equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons, so they are neutral in electric charge.
Atoms can gain or lose electrons and become ions, which are atoms that have a positive or negative charge because they have unequal numbers of protons and electrons.
The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization.
It may occur when atoms are exposed to high levels of radiation or when atoms transfer electrons to or from other atoms.
Ions are reactive, attracted or repulsed by other charged particles, and deflected by a magnetic field.

The model in the illustration below represents an atom of lithium (Li).
If the lithium atom becomes an ion, which type of ion will it be, a cation or an anion?
What will be the electric charge of this ion?
What will the ion be named?
What symbol will be used to represent it?
