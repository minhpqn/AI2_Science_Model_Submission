Thin, clay-rich layers are deposited in the winter.
The resulting layers are called varves .
Varves give scientists clues about past climate conditions ( Figure below ).
A warm summer might result in a very thick sediment layer.
A cooler summer might yield a thinner layer.
Like tree rings, these patterns can be used to identify time periods.

Where conditions vary seasonally, trees develop distinctive rings.
Ice contains more or less dust.
Lake sediments show more or less clay.
Tree rings, ice cores, and varves indicate the environmental conditions at the time they were made.
The distinctive patterns of tree rings, ice cores, and varves go back thousands of years.
They can be used to determine the time they were made.
