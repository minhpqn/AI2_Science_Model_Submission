These cells have an abnormal structure due to the damaged DNA.
In addition, they usually grow rapidly since the normal control processes regulating cell growth have been changed by the altered composition of the DNA.
Tissue damage is also common in people with severe exposure to radiation.
Effects of Radiation on Humans
We can see two general types of effects when humans are exposed to radiation.
Low-level exposure can lead to development of cancer.
The regulatory processes regulating cell growth are disrupted, leading to uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.
Acute exposure can produce nausea, weakness, skin burns, and internal tissue damage.
Cancer patients receiving radiation therapy experience these symptoms, but the radiation is targeted to a specific site in the body so that the damage is primarily to the cancer cells and the patient is able to recover from the exposure.
Basic cellular processes leading to protein synthesis are described.
Effects of ionizing radiation on protein synthesis are listed.
The impact of ionizing radiation on human health is discussed.
