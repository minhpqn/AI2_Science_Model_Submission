What is a bimolecular elementary process?
Do chemical reactions usually occur in a single step?
What does the overall balanced equation not tell us?
How do overall reactions usually proceed?
elementary step (or elementary reaction):
One step in a series of simple reactions that show the progress of a reaction at the molecular level.
reaction mechanism:
The sequence of elementary steps that together comprise an entire chemical reaction.
Describe the role of intermediates in reaction mechanisms.
The ozone radical is an intermediate that in the decomposition of ozone by ultraviolet radiation
Ozone (O 3 ) depletion in the atmosphere is of significant concern.
This gas serves as a protection against the ultraviolet rays of the sun.
Ozone is naturally depleted in addition to the depletion caused by human-made chemicals.
The depletion reaction is a two-step process:
& \text{O}_3 + \text{ultraviolet light} \rightarrow \text{O}_2 + {\text{O} \cdot} (\text{free radical}) \ \text{slow reaction} \\& {\text{O} \cdot} + \text{O}_3 \rightarrow 2 \text{O}_2 \ \text{fast reaction}
The free radical is not a part of the overall equation, but can be detected in the lab.
Reaction mechanisms describe how the material in a chemical reaction gets from the initial reactants to the final products.
One reaction that illustrates a reaction mechanism is the reaction between nitrogen monoxide and oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide:
2 \text{NO}(g)+ \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{NO}_2(g)
It may seem as though this reaction would occur as the result of a collision between two NO molecules with one O 2 molecule.
