Computer files simplify data, like electron configuration data
How big is a file?
If you keep your papers in manila folders, you can pick up a folder and see how much it weighs.
If you want to know how many different papers (articles, bank records, or whatever else you keep in a folder), you have to take everything out and count.
A computer directory, on the other hand, tells you exactly how much you have in each file.
We can get the same information on atoms.
If we use an orbital filling diagram, we have to count arrows.
When we look at electron configuration data, we simply add up the numbers.
Electron configuration notation eliminates the boxes and arrows of orbital filling diagrams.
Each occupied sublevel designation is written followed by a superscript that is the number of electrons in that sublevel.
For example, the hydrogen configuration is 1 s 1 , while the helium configuration is 1 s 2 .
Multiple occupied sublevels are written one after another.
The electron configuration of lithium is 1 s 2 2 s 1 .
The sum of the superscripts in an electron configuration is equal to the number of electrons in that atom, which is in turn equal to its atomic number.
Sample Problem:
Orbital Filling Diagrams and Electron Configurations
Draw the orbital filling diagram for carbon and write its electron configuration.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
atomic number of carbon, Z = 6
