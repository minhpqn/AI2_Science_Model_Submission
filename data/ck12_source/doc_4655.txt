For example, they have well-developed senses of touch, hearing, and smell.
They can also communicate their needs by crying.
During their first year, they develop many other abilities, including those described below.
For a video of major milestones in the first year of life, go to this link:
By 6 weeks after birth, infants typically start smiling (see Figure below ) and making vocal sounds.
By 6 months, infants are babbling.
They have also learned to sit and are starting to crawl.
The deciduous teeth (baby teeth) have started to come in.
By 12 months, infants may be saying their first words.
They usually can stand with help and may even have started to walk.
A baby’s first smile is an early milestone in infant development.
Infancy is the period of most rapid growth after birth.
Growth is even faster during infancy that it is during puberty.
By the end of the first year, the average baby is twice as long as it was at birth and three times as heavy.
A toddler is a child aged 1 to 3 years.
Children of this age are learning to walk, or “toddle.” Growth is still relatively rapid during the toddler years but it has begun to slow down.
During the next three years, children achieve many more milestones.
By age 4, most children can run, climb stairs, and scribble with a crayon.
They know many words and use simple sentences.
The majority are also toilet trained.
