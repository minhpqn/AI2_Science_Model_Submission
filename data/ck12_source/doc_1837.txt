Tulum is on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.
The beautiful blue Caribbean supplied the Maya with abundant fish.
What else would the Maya people have needed?
Fresh water is found in cenotes, sinkholes that are common in the Yucatan limestone.
Some water soaks into the ground.
It travels down through tiny holes in soil.
It seeps through cracks in rock.
The water moves slowly, pulled deeper and deeper by gravity.
Water in an underground rock or sediment layer is groundwater .
Underground water can also erode and deposit material.
Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as it falls.
The CO 2 combines with water to form carbonic acid.
The slightly acidic water is especially good at dissolving the rock limestone.
Groundwater creates landforms by dissolving away rock.
Florida is unique for groundwater erosion.
The state is extremely flat and is made mostly of limestone.
Due to the wet climate, groundwater surfaces in many locations.
In the Everglades, rivers create a wide floodplain and groundwater comes to the surface ( Figure below ).
