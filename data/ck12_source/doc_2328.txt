Technological Design Process
Define technological design.
List the steps of the technological design process.
This giant six-limbed robot is NASA’s Tri-ATHLETE.
As the robot’s name suggests, it is very “athletic.” It was designed to do the heavy lifting in explorations of other planets and moons in the universe.
The Tri (“three”) part of its name refers to the fact that the robot can split into two separate three-limbed robots.
These smaller robots can do things that the larger, six-limbed robot can’t.
What Is Technological Design?
The process in which tri-ATHLETE was created and perfected is called technological design .
This is the process in which most new technologies are developed.
Technological design is similar to scientific investigation.
Both processes rely on evidence and reason, and follow a logical sequence of steps to solve problems or answer questions.
