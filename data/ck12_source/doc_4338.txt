What's a chordate?
Most chordates are animals with backbones.
These range from small fish to giant whales, from playful dogs to ferocious cats.
Not nearly as diverse as the invertebrates.
But chordates do have many amazing species.

The tiger is also from the class Mammalia, order Carnivora, and family Felidae, meaning it is a meat-eating cat.
