For centuries, rockets were powered by gunpowder or other solid fuels.
These rockets could travel only short distances.
Around the turn of the 20th century, liquid fuel rockets were developed.
Liquid fuel gave the rockets enough power to escape Earth’s gravity.
By using multiple stages, empty fuel containers could drop away.
This reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could fly higher.
One of the first uses of rockets in space was to launch satellites.
A satellite is an object that orbits a larger object.
An orbit is a circular or elliptical path around an object.
Natural objects in orbit are called natural satellites.
The Moon is a natural satellite.
Human-made objects in orbit are called artificial satellites.
How a Satellite Stays in Orbit
Newton’s law of universal gravitation describes how an object can orbit a planet.
Every object in the Universe is attracted to every other object by gravity.
Gravity also keeps you from floating away into the sky.
Why doesn't gravity cause satellites to crash into Earth?
Newton used an example to explain how gravity makes orbiting possible.
Imagine a cannonball launched from a high mountain ( Figure below ).
If the cannonball is launched at a slow speed, it will fall back to Earth.
