Current flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose.
Increasing voltage with a higher-volt battery increases the current.
This is like opening the tap wider so more water flows through the hose.
Increasing resistance reduces the current.
This is like stepping on the hose so less water can flow through it.

Using Ohm’s Law to Calculate Current
You can use the equation for current (above) to calculate the amount of current flowing through a circuit when the voltage and resistance are known.
Consider an electric wire that is connected to a 12-volt battery.
If the wire has a resistance of 2 ohms, how much current is flowing through the wire?
Current = \mathrm{\frac{12\;volts}{2\;ohms}} = 6 amps
Q:
If a 120-volt voltage source is connected to a wire with 10 ohms of resistance, how much current is flowing through the wire?
A:
Substitute these values into the equation for current:
Current = \mathrm{\frac{120\;volts}{10\;ohms}} = 12 amps
According to Ohm’s law, greater voltage results in more current and greater resistance results in less current.
Ohm’s law can be represented by the equation:
\mathrm{Current \ (amps)} = \mathrm{\frac{Voltage \ (volts)}{Resistance \ (ohms)}}
