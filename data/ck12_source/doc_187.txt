The displacement is a vector quantity and vectors are discussed in the chapter "Vectors".
To return to the first image, these cars travel a distance of 500 miles over the course of the race.
However, they are traveling in a circle, and the start and finish line are the same.
Therefore, when the car finishes the race, it is in essentially the same position it was when it started.
The car's total displacement is only a few feet.
The length traveled by an object moving in any direction or even changing direction is called distance.
The location of an object in a frame of reference is called position.
For straight line motion, positions can be shown using a number line.
The separation between original and final position is called displacement.
Watch these two short videos to understand position, distance, and displacement, and answer the questions below:

What is position?
Can two objects be the same distance from a single point but be in different positions?
Why or why not?
What is the difference between distance and displacement?
Does distance have direction?
Does displacement have direction?
Explain the difference between distance and displacement in your own words.
Suppose that John lives on a square block that is 180 yards per side, and in the evenings, he walks with his dog around the block for a little exercise.
