What happens to a developing baby that lacks testosterone?
List three physical changes that occur in males during puberty.
Explain how and why boys change so much during puberty.
Describe how sperm are produced.
Explain the role of the seminiferous tubules.
Distinguish between spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids.
Summarize the structures of a mature sperm cell.
How many sperm does to take to fertilize an egg?
85 million sperm per day are produced...per testicle.
That's 170,000,000 every day.
This means that a single male may produce more than a quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000) sperm cells in his lifetime!
But it only takes one to fertilize an egg.
Production and Delivery of Sperm
A sexually mature male produces an astounding number of sperm â€”typically, hundreds of millions each day!
Sperm production usually continues uninterrupted until death, although the number and quality of sperm decline during later adulthood.
The process of producing mature sperm is called spermatogenesis .
Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes and become mature in the epididymis .
The entire process takes about 9 to 10 weeks.
You can watch an animation of spermatogenesis at this link:
If you look inside the seminiferous tubule shown in Figure below , you can see cells in various stages of spermatogenesis.
