Plant organs include roots, stems, and leaves.
Organ system :
Group of organs that work together to perform a certain function.
Examples of organ systems in a human include the skeletal, nervous, and reproductive systems.
Organism :
Individual living thing that may be made up of one or more organ systems.
Examples of these levels of organization are shown in Figure below .
Organization of digestive organ system in a mouse
An individual mouse is made up of several organ systems.
The system shown here is the digestive system, which breaks down food into a form that cells can use.
One of the organs of the digestive system is the stomach.
The stomach, in turn, consists of different types of tissues.
Each type of tissue is made up of cells of the same type.
There are also levels of organization above the individual organism.
These levels are illustrated in Figure below .
Organisms of the same species that live in the same area make up a population .
For example, all of the goldfish living in the same area make up a goldfish population.
All of the populations that live in the same area make up a community .
The community that includes the goldfish population also includes the populations of other fish, coral, and other organisms.
An ecosystem consists of all the living things ( biotic factors ) in a given area, together with the nonliving environment ( abiotic factors ).
