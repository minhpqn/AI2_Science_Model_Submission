Prokaryotes and Viruses
What's the smallest living organism?
Is it a virus?
Or a bacterium?
Are viruses living?
We could not exist without bacteria.
Could we exist without viruses?
These, and other questions will be addressed through the Prokaryotes and Viruses chapter.
Compare Bacteria to Archaea, and to Eukarya.
What are the most numerous organisms on the planet?
Bacteria.
And all it takes is one to quickly grow, under just the right conditions, into millions and billions.
Luckily, we know how to control bacteria when necessary.
But bacteria do serve many important purposes.
In fact, we could not survive without them.

Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus.
They also lack other membrane-bound organelles.
