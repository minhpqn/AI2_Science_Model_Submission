The body is shaped like an oval!
Haumea's longest axis is about the same as Pluto's diameter.
Its shortest axis is about half as long.
The body's orbit is tilted 28 degrees.
Haumea is so far from the Sun that it takes 283 years to make one orbit ( Figure below ).
Drawing of the dwarf planet Haumea and its moons
An artist’s drawing of what Haumea and its moons might look like.
The moons are drawn closer to Haumea than their actual orbits.
Haumea is the third-brightest Kuiper belt object.
Haumea has two moons.
Haumea's odd oval shape is probably caused by its extremely rapid rotation.
It rotates in just less than 4 hours!
Like other Kuiper belt objects, Haumea is covered by ice.
Its density is similar to Earth’s Moon, at 2.6 – 3.3 g/cm 3 .
This means that most of Haumea is rocky.
Haumea is part of a collisional family.
This is a group of astronomical objects that formed from an impact.
This family has Haumea, its two moons, and five more objects.
All of these objects are thought to have formed from a collision very early in the formation of the solar system.
Makemake is the third-largest and second-brightest dwarf planet we have discovered so far ( Figure below ).
