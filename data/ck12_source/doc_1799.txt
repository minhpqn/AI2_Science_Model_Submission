This process is called oxidation .
You are probably most familiar with the rust that forms when iron reacts with oxygen.
Many minerals are rich in iron.
Red rocks are full of iron oxides ( Figure below ).
As iron changes into iron oxide, the iron oxides can also make red color in soils.
The red rocks of Monument Valley are due to the oxidation of iron in the rock

Plants and Animals
Plants and animals also cause chemical weathering.
As plant roots take in nutrients, they remove elements from the minerals.
This causes a chemical change in the rock.
Mechanical Weathering and Chemical Weathering
Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering.
As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases.
With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur ( Figure below ).
Letâ€™s say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day.
It would be hard to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water.
Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk.
This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have.
Smaller pieces dissolve more easily.
