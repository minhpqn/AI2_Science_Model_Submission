Instead, the amount of energy in a photon depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave.
The frequency of a wave is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time, such as the number of waves per second.
In waves with higher frequencies, photons have more energy.
Evidence for the Wave-Particle Theory
After Einstein proposed his theory, evidence was discovered to support it.
For example, scientists shone laser light through two slits in a barrier made of a material that blocked light.
You can see the setup of this type of experiment in the Figure below .
Using a special camera that was very sensitive to light, they took photos of the light that passed through the slits.
The photos revealed tiny pinpoints of light passing through the double slits.
This seemed to show that light consists of particles.
However, if the camera was exposed to the light for a long time, the pinpoints accumulated in bands that resembled interfering waves.
Therefore, the experiment showed that light seems to consist of particles that act like waves.
Double slit experiment
Electromagnetic radiation behaves like waves of energy most of the time, but sometimes it behaves like particles.
From the 1600s until the early 1900s, most scientists thought that electromagnetic radiation consists either of particles or of waves but not both.
In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the wave-particle theory of electromagnetic radiation.
This theory states that electromagnetic energy is released in discrete packets of energy—now called photons—that act like waves.
After Einstein presented his theory, scientists found evidence to support it.
For example, double-slit experiments showed that light consists of tiny particles that create patterns of interference just as waves do.
