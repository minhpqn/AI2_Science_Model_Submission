Think producing millions of sperm each day is complicated?
If producing millions of sperm each day, as in the male reproductive system, is complicated, that is nothing compared to what must occur in the female reproductive system.
This system is controlled by an intricate dance of hormones, cycles, and events.
Female Reproductive Structures
The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce female gametes called eggs and secrete the female sex hormone estrogen .
The female reproductive system has several other functions as well:
It receives sperm during sexual intercourse.
It supports the development of a fetus.
It delivers a baby during birth.
It breast feeds a baby after birth.
The main structures of the female reproductive system are shown in Figure below .
Most of the structures are inside the pelvic region of the body.
Locate the structures in the figure as you read about them below.
