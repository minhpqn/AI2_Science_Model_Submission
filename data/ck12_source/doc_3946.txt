Describe the current mass extinction.
What is causing this extinction?
Why might the polar bear go extinct?
What is the relationship between red algae, krill, and penguins?
Why are penguin populations threatened?
Why is the temperature rising faster at the poles than elsewhere?
What is the role of biologists in facing these global challenges?
How is human overpopulation related to the sixth mass extinction?
Why might the brown tree snake or the Philippine Eagle serve as “poster species” for causes of the sixth mass extinction?
Describe a hypothetical example showing how rising sea levels due to global warming might cause extinction.
Create a poster that conveys simple tips for protecting biodiversity.
Renewable and Nonrenewable Resources
Define natural resource.
Give examples of natural resources.
Distinguish between renewable and nonrenewable resources.
Renewable or nonrenewable, what's the difference?
That's like asking the difference between having an endless supply and having a limited supply.
Will this planet eventually run out of oil?
Probably.
So oil is a nonrenewable resource.
