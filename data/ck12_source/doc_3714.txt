Griffith's discovery of bacteria transformation
Griffith’s Experimental Results.
Griffith showed that a substance could be transferred to harmless bacteria and make them deadly.
Based on his observations, Griffith deduced that something in the killed S strain was transferred to the previously harmless R strain, making the R strain deadly.
He called this process transformation , as something was "transforming" the bacteria from one strain into another strain.
What was that something?
What type of substance could change the characteristics of the organism that received it?
Avery’s Team Makes a Major Contribution
In the early 1940s, a team of scientists led by Oswald Avery tried to answer the question raised by Griffith’s results.
They inactivated various substances in the S-strain bacteria.
They then killed the S-strain bacteria and mixed the remains with live R-strain bacteria. (Keep in mind, the R-strain bacteria usually did not harm the mice.) When they inactivated proteins, the R-strain was deadly to the injected mice.
This ruled out proteins as the genetic material.
Why?
Even without the S-strain proteins, the R strain was changed, or transformed, into the deadly strain.
However, when the researchers inactivated DNA in the S strain, the R strain remained harmless.
This led to the conclusion that DNA is the substance that controls the characteristics of organisms.
In other words, DNA is the genetic material.

The conclusion that DNA is the genetic material was not widely accepted at first.
