Why is there a pile of cobbles in that stream?
A river meanders causing erosion on one side of its bank.
On the other side, sediments are deposited.
In this photo of a meander, where is there erosion and where is there deposition?
The size of particles determines how they are carried by flowing water; this is illustrated below ( Figure below ).

How Flowing Water Moves Particles.
How particles are moved by flowing water depends on their size.
Sediments are carried as:
Dissolved load :
Dissolved ions are carried in the water.
These ions usually travel all the way to the ocean.
Suspended load :
Sediments carried as solids as the stream flows are suspended load.
The size of particles that can be carried is determined by the streamâ€™s velocity ( Figure below ).
The Connecticut River is brown from the sediment it carries
The Connecticut River is brown from the sediment it carries.
The river drops the sediment offshore into Long Island Sound.
Bed load :
Some particles are too large to be carried as suspended load.
