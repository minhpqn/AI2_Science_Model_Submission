Explain why an electrical grid must have electric transformers.
If lightning strikes a transformer, it will cause power outages.
Which lightning strike is likely to affect the most electric power customers: a strike to a step-down transformer on an electric pole or a strike to a step-down transformer in an electric substation?
This unit introduces energy and energy resources.
Different forms of energy—including thermal and sound energy—are described.
The unit also explains how energy travels in waves, how light energy behaves, and how we use light to see.
Electricity and magnetism, and the relationship between them, are explored as well.
