Important questions to consider include the following.
What is the chemical's success against the target pest?
Will the insecticide provide the desired level of control of the pest?
If the answer is no, other methods of control should be considered.
Does the chemical have an impact on natural enemies of the pest?
In large scale efforts to rid areas of mosquitoes, the insecticide used also killed the dragonfly.
This effort removed a natural predator of the mosquito.
This may be an unacceptable negative effect of using the insecticide.
How susceptible is the crop to insect damage?
If the crop is not heavily damaged, only minor pest control may be needed.
This may affect the amount or type of insecticide used.
How toxic is the chemical to the environment and humans?
Some older insecticides are extremely poisonous.
Keep in mind that users of these poisons have a community responsibility to minimize the contamination of the surrounding environment, as well as keeping animals, surrounding crops and humans safe.
Does using the pesticide result in the development of resistance?
If so, this can make additional use of the pesticide less effective.
As the resistance will be passed to future generations of the insect (which is natural selection in action), this could be considered a negative side-effect of pesticide use.
Harmful insects include those that can destroy buildings and crops or transmit disease.
Insecticides are commonly used to control insect pests, but they can have harmful effects on the environment.
