Photosynthesis involves many chemical reactions, but they can be summed up in a single chemical equation:
6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Light Energy → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 .
Photosynthetic autotrophs capture light energy from the sun and absorb carbon dioxide and water from their environment.
Using the light energy, they combine the reactants to produce glucose and oxygen, which is a waste product.
They store the glucose, usually as starch, and they release the oxygen into the atmosphere.
Cellular respiration actually “burns” glucose for energy.
However, it doesn’t produce light or intense heat as some other types of burning do.
This is because it releases the energy in glucose slowly, in many small steps.
It uses the energy that is released to form molecules of ATP.
Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions, which can be summed up with this chemical equation:
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Chemical Energy (in ATP)
Cellular respiration occurs in the cells of all living things.
It takes place in the cells of both autotrophs and heterotrophs.
All of them burn glucose to form ATP.
Autotrophs store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they build themselves.
Most autotrophs make their "food" through photosynthesis using the energy of the sun.
Heterotrophs cannot make their own food, so they must eat or absorb it.
Chemosynthesis is used to produce food using the chemical energy stored in inorganic molecules.
