Conditions were ideal.
The bacteria divided every 30 minutes.
After just 10 hours, there were more than a million bacteria!
Assume the bacteria population keeps growing at this rate.
How many bacteria will there be at 10.5 hours?
Or at 12 hours?

Population Growth Rate
The population growth rate is how fast a population is growing.
The letter r stands for the growth rate.
The growth rate equals the number of new members added to the population in a year for each 100 members already in the population.
The growth rate includes new members added to the population and old members removed from the population.
Births add new members to the population.
Deaths remove members from the population.
The formula for population growth rate is:
r = b - d , where
b = birth rate (number of births in 1 year per 100 population members)
d = death rate (number of deaths in 1 year per 100 population members)
If the birth rate is greater than the death rate, r is positive.
This means that the population is growing bigger.
