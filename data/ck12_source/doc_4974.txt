Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins; a family of proteins involved in transmitting chemical signals outside the cell, causing changes inside the cell.
G protein-linked receptor :
A large protein family of transmembrane receptors that bind molecules outside the cell and activate signal transduction pathways inside the cell; also known as G protein coupled receptors and seven-transmembrane domain receptors.
GTPase :
A large family of hydrolase enzymes that can bind and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP).
second messenger :
A molecule that relays a signal from a receptor on the cell surface to target molecules inside the cell.
signal-transduction :
The process that occurs when an extracellular signaling molecule activates a cell surface receptor, which then alters intracellular molecules creating a response.
Signal transduction occurs when a ligand binds its receptor and alters intracellular conditions.
Often the signal is transducer from the outside of the cell to the inside.
This process usually involves G-protein linked receptors and cyclic AMP.
