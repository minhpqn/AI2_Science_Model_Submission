Stone caused the transmutation of lead into gold.
One of the main goals of the alchemists was to create this stone.
Nature of Science
Explain the goal of science.
Describe how science advances knowledge.
Design a scientific experiment.
Does the word science make you think of high-tech labs and researchers in white coats like the ones in this picture?
This is often an accurate image of science but not always.
If you look up science in a dictionary, you would find that it comes from a Latin word that means “having knowledge.” However, this isn’t an adequate definition either.
What Is Science?
Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having knowledge.
Science is a way of learning about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic.
In other words, science is a process, not just a body of facts.
Through the process of science, our knowledge of the world advances.
The Goal of Science
Scientists may focus on very different aspects of the natural world.
For example, some scientists focus on the world of tiny objects, such as atoms and molecules.
Other scientists devote their attention to huge objects, such as the sun and other stars.
But all scientists have at least one thing in common.
