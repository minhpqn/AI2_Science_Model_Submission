Two common problems of the skin are acne and skin cancer (see Figure below ).
Acne is a condition in which red bumps called pimples form on the skin due to a bacterial infection.
It affects more than 85 percent of teens and may continue into adulthood.
The underlying cause of acne is excessive secretion of sebum, which plugs hair follicles and makes them good breeding grounds for bacteria.

Skin cancer is a disease in which skin cells grow out of control.
It is caused mainly by excessive exposure to UV light.
People with lighter skin are at greater risk of developing skin cancer because they have less melanin to block harmful UV radiation.
The best way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid UV exposure by using sunscreen and wearing protective clothing.
Signs of skin cancer
ABCDs of Skin Cancer.
A brown spot on the skin is likely to be a harmless mole, but it could be a sign of skin cancer.
Unlike moles, skin cancers are generally asymmetrical, have irregular borders, may be very dark in color, and may have a relatively great diameter.
The skin consists of two layers: the epidermis, which contains mainly epithelial cells, and the dermis, which contains most of skinâ€™s other structures, including blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and glands.
Skin protects the body from injury, water loss, and microorganisms.
It also plays a major role in maintaining a stable body temperature.
Common skin problems include acne and skin cancer.
