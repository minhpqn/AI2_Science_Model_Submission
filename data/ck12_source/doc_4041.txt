Explain how this evidence supports the theory.
How are additional mitochondria produced?
Identify protist characteristics.
List protist habitats.
Describe forms of protist motility.
Explain protist reproduction.
Summarize protist nutrition.
Sexual or asexual reproduction for protists?
Notice how the Paramecium is dividing into two cells.
This, obviously, is a form of asexual reproduction.
But, remember that protists are an extremely diverse kingdom, and some protists can also reproduce sexually.
Characteristics of Protists
Like all other eukaryotes, protists have a nucleus containing their DNA.
They also have other membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.
Most protists are single-celled.
Some are multicellular.
Because the protist kingdom is so diverse, their ways of getting food and reproducing vary widely.
Most protists are aquatic organisms.
They need a moist environment to survive.
They are found mainly in damp soil, marshes, puddles, lakes, and the ocean.
