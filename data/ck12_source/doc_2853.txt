It changed how scientists view energy and matter, which are two of the most basic concepts in all of science.
The equation shows that energy and matter are two forms of the same thing.
This new idea turned science upside down when Einstein introduced it in the early 1900s.
Amazingly, the idea has withstood the test of time as more and more evidence has been gathered to support it.
You can listen to a recording of Einstein explaining his famous equation at this URL:
Q :
What do the letters in Einstein’s equation stand for?
A :
E stands for energy, m stands for mass, and c stands for the speed of light.
The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, so c 2 is a very big number.
Therefore, the amount of energy in even a small mass of matter is tremendous.
Suppose, for example, that you have 1 gram of matter.
That’s about the mass of a paperclip.
Multiplying this mass by c 2 would yield enough energy to power 3,600 homes for a year!
Mass and Energy in Nuclear Reactions
Einstein’s equation helps scientists understand what happens in nuclear reactions and why they produce so much energy.
When the nucleus of a radioisotope undergoes fission or fusion in a nuclear reaction, it loses a tiny amount of mass.
What happens to the lost mass?
It isn’t really lost at all.
It is converted to energy.
