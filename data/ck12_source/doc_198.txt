Example:  Suppose a planner is designing an airport for small airplanes.  Such planes must reach a speed of 56 m/s before takeoff and can accelerate at 12.0 m/s 2 .  What is the minimum length for the runway of this airport?
Solution:  The acceleration in this problem is constant and the initial velocity of the airplane is zero.
Therefore, we can use the equation  v{_f}^2 = 2ad and solve for d .
d=\frac{v{_f}^2}{2a}=\frac{(56 \ \text{m/s})^2}{(2)(12.0 \ \text{m/s}^2)}=130 \ \text{m}
Example:  How long does it take a car to travel 30.0 m if it accelerates from rest at a rate of 2.00 m/s 2 ?
Solution:  The acceleration in this problem is constant and the initial velocity is zero, therefore, we can use  d = \frac{1}{2} at^2 solved for t .
t=\sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}}=\sqrt{\frac{(2)(30.0 \ \text{m})}{2.00 \ \text{m/s}^2}}=5.48 \ \text{s}
Example:  A baseball pitcher throws a fastball with a speed of 30.0 m/s.
Assume the acceleration is uniform and the distance through which the ball is accelerated is 3.50 m.
What is the acceleration?
Solution:  Since the acceleration is uniform and the initial velocity is zero, we can use  v{_f}^2 = 2ad solve for a .
a=\frac{v_f^2}{2d}=\frac{(30.0 \ \text{m/s})^2}{(2)(3.50 \ \text{m})}=\frac{900. \ \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2}{7.00 \ \text{m}}=129 \ \text{m/s}^2
Suppose we plot the velocity versus time graph for an object undergoing uniform acceleration.  In this first case, we will assume the object started from rest.
If the object has a uniform acceleration of 6.0 m/s 2 and started from rest, then each succeeding second, the velocity will increase by 6.0 m/s.  Here is the table of values and the graph.
Velocity versus time graph
In displacement versus time graphs, the slope of the line is the velocity of the object.
In this case of a velocity versus time graph, the slope of the line is the acceleration.
If you take any segment of this line and determine the  \Delta y to  \Delta x ratio, you will get 6.0 m/s 2 which we know to be the constant acceleration of this object.
We know from geometry that the area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying one-half the base times the height.  The area under the curve in the image above is the area of the triangle shown below.
The area of this triangle would be calculated by \text{area} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(6.0 \ \text{s})(36 \ \text{m/s}) = 108 \ \text{m}
