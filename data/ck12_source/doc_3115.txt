A:
Her gravitational potential energy is:
GPE = 360 N × 1.2 m = 432 N • m, or 432 J
Elastic Potential Energy
Potential energy due to an object’s shape is called elastic potential energy.
This energy results when an elastic object is stretched or compressed.
The farther the object is stretched or compressed, the greater its potential energy is.
A point will be reached when the object can’t be stretched or compressed any more.
Then it will forcefully return to its original shape.
Look at the pogo stick in the Figure below .
Its spring has elastic potential energy when it is pressed down by the boy's weight.
When it can’t be compressed any more, it will spring back to its original shape.
The energy it releases will push the pogo stick—and the boy—off the ground.
You can see how a pogo stick spring compresses and then returns to its original shape in the animation at this URL:
This pogo stick stores energy in its spring
Q:
The girl in the Figure below is giving the elastic band of her slingshot potential energy by stretching it.
She’s holding a small stone against the stretched band.
What will happen when she releases the band?
