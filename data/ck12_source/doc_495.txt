Distinguish between mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, pain receptors, and proprioceptors.
What if you felt no pain?
It might sound good to you to have a condition where you feel no pain.
But actually this type of condition would be very dangerous.
What would happen if you strained your back but felt no pain?
Instead of resting your back, you might injure it further.
When you look at the prickly cactus pictured below ( Figure below ), does the word "ouch" come to mind?
Touching the cactus would be painful.
Touch is the sense of pain, pressure, or temperature.
Touch depends on sensory neurons , or nerve cells, in the skin.
The skin on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch.
The tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well.
Neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles, joints, and organs.
If you have a stomach ache or pain from a sprained ankle, itâ€™s because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body.
Touching a cactus would trigger neurons that sense pain
The spines on this cactus are like needles; they help keep away animals that might want to eat the cactus.
The following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain, as well as how the brain responds to the messages.
Suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in.
You might stick one bare foot in the water.
Neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system.
