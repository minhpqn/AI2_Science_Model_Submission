In essence, these high energy electrons are holding the energy needed to support life.
...And Change the Rules of Chemistry for Life!
The excited electrons leave chlorophyll to participate in further reactions, leaving the chlorophyll “at a loss”; eventually they must be replaced.
That replacement process also requires light, working with an enzyme complex to split water molecules.
In this process of photolysis (“splitting by light”), H 2 O molecules are broken into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen atoms.
The electrons replace those originally lost from chlorophyll.
Hydrogen ions and the high-energy electrons from chlorophyll will carry on the energy transformation drama after the Light Reactions are over.
The oxygen atoms, however, form oxygen gas, which is a waste product of photosynthesis ( Figure below ).
The oxygen given off supplies most of the oxygen in our atmosphere.
Before photosynthesis evolved, Earth’s atmosphere lacked oxygen altogether, and this highly reactive gas was toxic to the many organisms living at the time.
Something had to change!
Most contemporary organisms rely on oxygen for efficient respiration.
So plants don’t just “restore” the air, as Joseph Priestley suggested.
They also had a major role in creating it!
Photosynthesis has made the Earth’s atmosphere today very different from what it was 2-3 billion years ago, by giving off oxygen gas as waste.
The table to the right shows the composition of today’s atmosphere.
On the left is an Apollo 17 photograph of Earth.
To summarize, chloroplasts “capture” sunlight energy in two ways.
Light “excites” electrons in pigment molecules, and light provides the energy to split water molecules, providing more electrons as well as hydrogen ions.
Now let’s follow those excited electrons…
