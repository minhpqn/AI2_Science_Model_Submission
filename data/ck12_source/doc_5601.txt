\frac{4 \ \text{cups}}{2 \ \text{pints}}=\frac{2 \ \text{pints}}{1 \ \text{quart}}=\frac{1 \ \text{quart}}{0.25 \ \text{gallon}}=1
Since the numerator and denominator represent equal quantities in each case, all are valid conversion factors.
Scientific Dimensional Analysis
Conversion factors are used in solving problems in which a certain measurement must be expressed with different units.
When a given measurement is multiplied by an appropriate conversion factor, the numerical value changes, but the actual size of the quantity measured remains the same.
Dimensional analysis is a technique that uses the units (dimensions) of the measurement in order to correctly solve problems.
Dimensional analysis is best illustrated with an example.
Sample Problem:
Dimensional Analysis
How many seconds are in a day?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
1 day = 24 hours
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
1 day = ? seconds
The known quantities above represent the conversion factors that we will use.
The first conversion factor will have day in the denominator so that the “day” unit will cancel.
The second conversion factor will then have hours in the denominator, while the third conversion factor will have minutes in the denominator.
As a result, the unit of the last numerator will be seconds and that will be the units for the answer.
