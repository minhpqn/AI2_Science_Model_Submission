Is this Blue-footed Booby actually dancing?
The courtship of the Blue-footed Booby consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and dancing to impress the female.
During the dance, the male will spread his wings and stamp his feet on the ground.
Are these birds born with this skill, or do they learn it?
Behaviors that are closely controlled by genes with little or no environmental influence are called innate behaviors .
These are behaviors that occur naturally in all members of a species whenever they are exposed to a certain stimulus .
Innate behaviors do not have to be learned or practiced.
They are also called instinctive behaviors.
An instinct is the ability of an animal to perform a behavior the first time it is exposed to the proper stimulus.
For example, a dog will drool the first time—and every time—it is exposed to food.
Significance of Innate Behavior
Innate behaviors are rigid and predictable.
All members of the species perform the behaviors in the same way.
Innate behaviors usually involve basic life functions, such as finding food or caring for offspring.
Several examples are shown in Figure below .
If an animal were to perform such important behaviors incorrectly, it would be less likely to survive or reproduce.
