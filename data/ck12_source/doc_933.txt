If the secondary voltage is larger than the primary voltage, the transformer is called a step-up transformer .
If the voltage out of the transformer is smaller than the voltage in, then the transformer is called a step-down transformer .
In an ideal transformer, the electric power put into the primary equals the electric power delivered by the secondary.
V_PI_P = V_SI_S
The current that flows in the primary depends on how much current is required by the secondary circuit.
Example Problem:
A particular step-up transformer has 200 turns on the primary coil and 3000 turns on the secondary coil.
If the voltage on the primary coil is 90.0 V, what is the voltage on the secondary coil?
If the current in the secondary circuit is 2.00 A, what is the current in the primary coil?
What is the power in the primary circuit?
What is the power in the secondary circuit?
\frac{V_P}{V_S}=\frac{N_P}{N_S} \qquad \frac{90.0 \ V}{V_S}=\frac{200}{3000} \qquad V_S=\frac{(90.0 \ V)(3000)}{(200)}=1350 \ V
\frac{I_S}{I_P}=\frac{N_P}{N_S} \qquad \frac{2.00 \ A}{I_P}=\frac{200}{3000} \qquad I_P=30.0 \ A
P_P = V_PI_P = (90.0 \ V)(30.0 \ A) = 2700 \ W
P_S = V_SI_S = (1350 \ V)(2.00 \ A) = 2700 \ W
When a current begins to flow in a wire, a circular magnetic field forms around the wire.
Within the first fractional second when the current begins to flow, the magnetic field expands outward from the wire.
If a second wire is placed nearby, the expanding field will pass through the second wire and induce a brief current in the wire.
A transformer is a device used to increase or decrease alternating current voltages.
A transformer has two coils, electrically insulated from each other.
