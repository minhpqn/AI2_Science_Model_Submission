Q:
The compound sodium chloride is very different from the elements sodium and chlorine that combine to form it.
What are some properties of sodium chloride?
A:
Sodium chloride is an odorless white solid that is harmless unless consumed in large quantities.
In fact, it is a necessary component of the human diet.
Structure of Compounds
Compounds like sodium chloride form structures called crystals.
A crystal is a rigid framework of many ions locked together in a repeating pattern.
Ions are electrically charged forms of atoms.
You can see a crystal of sodium chloride in the Figure below .
It is made up of many sodium and chloride ions.
Sodium and chloride ions make up a sodium chloride crystal
A sodium chloride crystal consists of many sodium ions (blue) and chloride ions (green) arranged in a rigid framework.
You can actually watch a crystal forming (with time-lapse photography) at this URL:  (1:09).

Compounds such as carbon dioxide and water form molecules instead of crystals.
A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound that still has the compoundâ€™s properties.
It consists of two or more atoms bonded together.
You saw models of carbon dioxide and water molecules above.
