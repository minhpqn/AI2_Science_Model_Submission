A compound is a substance made of two or more elements.
The elements in a chemical compound are always present in a certain ratio.
Water is probably one of the simplest compounds that you know.
A water molecule is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom ( Figure below ).
All water molecules have the same ratio: two hydrogen ions to one oxygen ion.
Structure of a water molecule
A water molecule has two hydrogen ions (shown in gray) bonded to one oxygen ion (shown in red).
An atom has negatively-charged electrons in orbit around its nucleus.
The nucleus of an atom is composed of positively-charged protons, and neutrons, which have no charge.
An atom that gains or loses electrons is an ion.
