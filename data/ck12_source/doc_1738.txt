Climate Zones and Biomes
Understand the similarities in climate zones between altitude and latitude.
Describe the major climate zones, and explain how they relate to biomes.
How are altitude and latitude similar?
The top of Mt.
Humphreys (top), the highest point in Arizona, is 12,637 feet (3,852 m).
Only a few plants can live in this harsh environment.
The life zone is tundra.
Tundra is also seen in high latitudes, like Denali National Park in Alaska (bottom).
Denali is at 63Â° north.
Major Climate Types
Major climate types are based on temperature and precipitation.
Latitude plays an important role in determining the climate of a region.
However, many other factors play a role in climate.
Oceans and mountain ranges influence climate in the same ways worldwide ( Figure below ).
You can see where the climate types are on the map, and then read about them below.
