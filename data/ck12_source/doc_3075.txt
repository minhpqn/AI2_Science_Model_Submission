Describe the three classes of levers.
Outline how each class of lever changes force.
A hammer can be used to pull a nail out of a board.
You can see how it’s done in this picture.
When you push down on the handle of the hammer, the claw end of the hammer pulls up on the nail.
A hammer is an example of a machine called a lever.
What Is a Lever?
A lever is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around a fixed point.
The fixed point of a lever is called the fulcrum.
Like other machines, a lever makes work easier by changing the force applied to the machine or the distance over which the force is applied.

How does a hammer make it easier to pull a nail out of a board?
First, it changes the direction of the force applied to the hammer—the hand pushes down on the handle while the claw end of the hammer head pulls up.
Often, you can push down with more force than you can push up because you can put your own weight behind it.
The hammer also increases the strength of the force that is applied to it.
It easily pulls the nail out of the board, which you couldn’t do with your hands alone.
