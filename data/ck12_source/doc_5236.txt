If a trait is autosomal it will affect males and females equally.
A sex-linked trait is a trait whose allele is found on a sex chromosome.
The human X chromosome is significantly larger than the Y chromosome; there are many more genes located on the X chromosome than there are on the Y chromosome.
As a result there are many more X-linked traits than there are Y-linked traits.
Most sex-linked traits are recessive.
Because males carry only one X chromosome, if they inherit a recessive sex-linked gene they will show a sex-linked condition; there is no dominant allele to offset the recessive allele.
Because of the recessive nature of most sex-linked traits, a female who shows a sex-linked condition would have to have two copies of the sex-linked allele, one on each of her X chromosomes.
Figure below shows how red-green colorblindness, a sex-linked disorder, is passed from parent to offspring.
An X-linked disorder such as red-green colorblindness is normally passed onto the son of a carrier mother.
Usually, females are unaffected as they have a second, normal copy of the allele on the second X chromosome.
However, if a female inherits two defective copies of the allele, she will be colorblind.
Therefore, every son of a colorblind woman will be colorblind.
Dominant or Recessive?
If the trait is autosomal dominant, every person with the trait will have a parent with the trait.
If the trait is recessive, a person with the trait may have one, both or neither parent with the trait.
An example of an autosomal dominant disorder in humans is Huntington’s disease (HD).
Huntington’s disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system.
It has no obvious effect on phenotype until the person is aged 35 to 45 years old, so often these individuals have children.
The disease is non-curable and, eventually, fatal.
Every child born to a person who develops HD has a 50% chance of inheriting the defective allele from the parent.
