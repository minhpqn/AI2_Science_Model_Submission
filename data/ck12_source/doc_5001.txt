Endothermic reaction that occurs in organisms; chemical reaction that builds new molecules and/or stores energy.
catabolic reaction :
Chemical reaction that breaks down more complex organic molecules into simpler substances; usually releases energy.
decomposition reaction :
Type of chemical reaction in which a compound is broken down into smaller compounds or elements.
endothermic reaction :
Any chemical reaction that consumes energy.
enthalpy :
A measure of the total energy of a thermodynamic system.
entropy :
A measure of the tendency of a process, such as a chemical reaction, to proceed in a particular direction.
exothermic reaction :
Any chemical reaction that releases energy.
Chemical reactions follow the laws of thermodynamics.
Some chemical reactions are exothermic, which means they release energy.
Other chemical reactions are endothermic, which means they consume energy.
Catabolic and anabolic reactions occur in cells/organisms.
