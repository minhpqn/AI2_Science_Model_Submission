Latitude and Precipitation
Global air currents affect precipitation.
How they affect it varies with latitude ( Figure below ).
Where air rises, it cools and there is precipitation.
Where air sinks, it warms and causes evaporation.
These patterns are part of the global wind belts.

You can see how they affect climate on the right.
"Five Factors that Affect Climate" takes a very thorough look at what creates the climate zones.
The climate of a region allows certain plants to grow, creating an ecological biome:

Prevailing winds are the result of atmospheric circulation cells.
They influence the climate of a region.
Rising and sinking air can influence the precipitation of a region.
