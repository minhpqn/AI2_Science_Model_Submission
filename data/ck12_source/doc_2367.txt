Measuring Mass with a Balance
Mass is the amount of matter in an object.
Scientists often measure mass with a balance.
A type of balance called a triple beam balance is pictured in Figure below .
To use this type of balance, follow these steps:
Place the object to be measured on the pan at the left side of the balance.
Slide the movable masses to the right until the right end of the arm is level with the balance mark.
Start by moving the larger masses and then fine tune the measurement by moving the smaller masses as needed.
Read the three scales to determine the values of the masses that were moved to the right.
Their combined mass is equal to the mass of the object.
Picture of a triple beam balance
The Figure below is an enlarged version of the scales of the triple beam balance in Figure above .
It allows you to read the scales.
The middle scale, which measures the largest movable mass, reads 300 grams.
This is followed by the top scale, which reads 30 grams.
The bottom scale reads 5.1 grams.
Therefore, the mass of the object in the pan is 335.1 grams (300 grams + 30 grams + 5.1 grams).
