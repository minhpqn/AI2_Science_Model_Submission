The process of amino acid assembly takes place in the ribosome.
This structure consists of two subunits containing ribosomal RNA that enclose the mRNA and catalyze the formation of the amide linkages in the growing protein in a process known as translation .
When protein synthesis is complete, the two subunits dissociate and release the completed protein chain.
The process of protein synthesis is fairly fast.
Amino acids are added to the growing peptide chain at a rate of about 3-5 amino acids per second.
A small protein (100-200 amino acids) can be produced in a minute or less.
