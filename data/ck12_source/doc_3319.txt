Explain why electric current doesn’t flow through rubber.
Jon can see the conductor of the power cord for an electric lamp.
Should he use the lamp?
Why or why not?
Explain Ohm’s law.
Use Ohm’s law to calculate current from voltage and resistance.
Look at the water spraying out of this garden hose.
You have to be careful using water around power tools and electric outlets because water can conduct an electric current.
But in some ways, water flowing through a hose is like electric current flowing through a wire.
Introducing Ohm’s Law
For electric current to flow through a wire, there must be a source of voltage.
Voltage is a difference in electric potential energy.
As you might have guessed, greater voltage results in more current.
As electric current flows through matter, particles of matter resist the moving charges.
This is called resistance, and greater resistance results in less current.
These relationships between electric current, voltage, and resistance were first demonstrated in the early 1800s by a German scientist named Georg Ohm, so they are referred to as Ohm’s law.
Ohm’s law can be represented by the following equation.
Current(amps) = \mathrm{\frac{Voltage(volts)}{Resistance(ohms)}}
Understanding Ohm’s Law
Ohm’s law may be easier to understand with an analogy.
