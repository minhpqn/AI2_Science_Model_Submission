At the cathode, water is reduced to hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions.
& \text{oxidation (anode):} && 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{O}_2(g)+4\text{H}^+(aq)+4e^- && E^0 = -1.23 \text{ V} \\& \text{reduction (cathode):} && 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+2e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2(g)+2\text{OH}^-(aq) && E^0 = -0.83 \text{ V} \\\hline& \text{overall reaction:} && 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{O}_2(g)+2\text{H}_2(g) && E^0{_\text{cell}} = -2.06 \text{ V}
In order to obtain the overall reaction, the reduction half-reaction was multiplied by two to equalize the electrons.
The hydrogen ion and hydroxide ions produced in each reaction combine to form water.
The H 2 SO 4 is not consumed in the reaction.
