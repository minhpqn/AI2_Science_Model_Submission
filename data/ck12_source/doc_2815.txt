Elements and Protons
For an atom of one element to change into a different element, the number of protons in its nucleus must change.
That’s because each element has a unique number of protons.
For example, lead atoms always have 82 protons, and gold atoms always have 79 protons.
Q:
So how can one element change into another?
A:
The starting element must be radioactive, and its nuclei must gain or lose protons.
Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus.
The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation .
Only unstable nuclei emit radiation.
They are unstable because they have too much energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons.
For example, all elements with more than 83 protons—such as uranium, radium, and polonium—have unstable nuclei.
They are called radioactive elements.
The nuclei of these elements must lose protons to become more stable.
When they do, they become different elements.
How Radioactivity Was Discovered
Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine Henri Becquerel, who is pictured below .
Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which was known to glow after being exposed to sunlight.
Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light or X-rays.
