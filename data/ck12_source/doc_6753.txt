The collision time is 0.01 seconds.
You hit the deck and bend your legs, lengthening the collision time to 0.2 seconds.
You hit the deck, but it isnâ€™t wood!
It is simply a piece of paper painted to look like a deck.
Below is an infinite void and you continue to fall, forever.
Which method will involve the greatest force acting on you?
Which method will involve the least force acting on you?
Which method will land you on the deck in the least pain?
Which method involves the least impulse delivered to you?
Which method involves the greatest impulse delivered to you?
You punch the wall with your fist.
Clearly your fist has momentum before it hits the wall.

Explain.
You look up one morning and see that a 30 \;\mathrm{kg} chunk of asbestos from your ceiling is falling on you!

Explain your answer.
A baseball player faces a 80.0 \;\mathrm{m/s} pitch.
In a matter of .020 seconds he swings the bat, hitting a 50.0\;\mathrm{m/s} line drive back at the pitcher.
