Mammals raise their hair with tiny muscles in the skin.
Even humans automatically contract these muscles when they are cold.
They cause “goosebumps,” as shown here.
How Mammals Stay Cool
One way mammals lose excess heat is by increasing blood flow to the skin.
This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment.
That’s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on a hot day.
You are likely to sweat as well.
Sweating also reduces body heat.
Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body.
Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat.
Animals with fur, such as dogs, use panting instead of sweating to lose body heat (see Figure below ).
Evaporation of water from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth and throat uses heat and helps cool the body.
Panting Dog.
This dog is overheated.
It is losing excess body heat by panting.
Mammals have several ways of generating and conserving heat, such as a high metabolic rate and hair to trap heat.
Mammals also have several ways to stay cool, including sweating or panting.
