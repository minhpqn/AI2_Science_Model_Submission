Even if you’ve never used a compass, you probably know that the needle of a compass always points north.
That’s because a compass needle is magnetized, so it is attracted by a magnet.
Q:
What magnet attracts a compass needle?
A:
A compass needle is attracted by magnet Earth.
It always points north because Earth acts as a giant magnet.
Earth’s Magnetic Poles
Imagine a huge bar magnet passing through Earth’s axis, as in the Figure below .
This is a good representation of Earth as a magnet.
Like a bar magnet, Earth has north and south magnetic poles.
A magnetic pole is the north or south end of a magnet, where the magnet exerts the most force.

Two North Poles
Although the needle of a compass always points north, it doesn’t point to Earth’s north geographic pole.
Find the north geographic pole in the Figure below .
As you can see, it is located at 90° north latitude.
Where does a compass needle point instead?
It points to Earth’s north magnetic pole, which is located at about 80° north latitude.
Earth also has two south poles: a south geographic pole and a south magnetic pole.
