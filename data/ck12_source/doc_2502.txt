The only element that normally lacks neutrons is _________.
What is a neutron?
Compare and contrast neutrons and protons.
Explain how isotopes of an element differ from one another.
Give an example.
Identify the fundamental particles that make up a neutron.
Explain where electrons are found in atoms.
Describe energy levels in atoms.
Watch out!
Lightning is extremely dangerous.
A single bolt of lightning can carry a billion volts of electricity.
That’s enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb—for three months!
As impressive as it is, lightning is nothing more than a sudden flow of extremely tiny particles.
What are the particles that flow in a lightning bolt?
The answer is electrons.
What Are Electrons?
Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up atoms.
The other two types are protons and neutrons.
Unlike protons and neutrons, which consist of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are fundamental particles that do not consist of smaller particles.
They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons.
