A polysaccharide is a complex carbohydrate polymer formed from the linkage of many monosaccharide monomers.
One of the best known polysaccharides is starch, the main form of energy storage in plants.
Starch is a staple in most human diets.
Foods such as corn, potatoes, rice, and wheat have high starch contents.
Starch is made of glucose monomers and occurs in both straight-chain and branched forms.
Amylose is the straight-chain form and consists of hundreds of linked glucose molecules.
The branched form of starch is called amylopectin.
In the small intestine, starch is hydrolyzed to form glucose.
The glucose can then be converted to biochemical energy or stored for later use.
Structure of amylose and amylopectin
Amylose and amylopectin are the two most common components of naturally occurring starch.
Both consist of many glucose monomers connected into a polymer.
Starch serves as energy storage in plants.
Glycogen is an even more highly branched polysaccharide of glucose monomers that serves a function of energy storage in animals.
Glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and muscles.
Structure of glycogen
Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose and serves as energy storage in animals.
Cellulose is another polymer of glucose, consisting of anywhere from hundreds to over ten thousand monomers.
It is the structural component of the cell walls of green plants and is the single most common organic molecule on Earth.
Roughly 33% of all plant matter is cellulose.
