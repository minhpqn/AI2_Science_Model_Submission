More complex organisms such as jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones have a tissue level of organization.
For example, jellyfish have tissues that have separate protective, digestive, and sensory functions.
Though most animals have many different types of cells, they only have four basic types of tissue: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial.
Even more complex organisms, such as the roundworm shown in Figure above , while also having differentiated cells and tissues, have an organ level of development.
An organ is a group of tissues that has a specific function or group of functions.
Organs can be as primitive as the brain of a flatworm (a group of nerve cells), as large as the stem of a sequoia (up to 90 meters, or 300 feet, in height), or as complex as a human liver.
The most complex organisms (such as mammals, trees, and flowers) have organ systems.
An organ system is a group of organs that act together to carry out complex related functions, with each organ focusing on a part of the task.
An example is the human digestive system in which the mouth ingests food, the stomach crushes and liquifies it, the pancreas and gall bladder make and release digestive enzymes, and the intestines absorb nutrients into the blood.
biofilm :
A colony of prokaryotes that is stuck to a surface, such as a rock or a hostâ€™s tissue.
colonial organism :
Organism formed from a grouping of individuals of the same species living symbiotically together; one of the first evolutionary steps towards multicellular organisms.
Colonial Theory :
Proposes that cooperation between many organisms of the same species led to the development of a multicellular organism.
colony :
A group of individual organisms of the same species that live closely together.
multicellular organism :
Organism made up of more than one type of cell; most have specialized cells that are grouped together to carry out specialized functions.
