Outline the form and function of cellular structures.
How are chromosomes separated during cell division?
They are pulled apart by spindle fibers.
The fibers are made of microtubules and are organized by the centrioles.
Two pairs of centrioles are seen on opposite sides of the cell during prophase, the first phase of mitosis.
Centrioles are rod-like structures made of short microtubules.
Though they are found in most eukaryotic cells, centrioles are absent in some plants and most fungi.
Nine groups of three microtubules (nine triplets) make up each centriole.
The nine triplets are arranged in a cartwheel-like orientation.
Two perpendicularly placed centrioles make up the centrosome .
Centrioles are very important in cellular division, where they arrange the mitotic spindles that pull the chromosome apart during mitosis.
The position of the centriole determines the position of the nucleus, thus playing a crucial role in the spatial arrangement of the cell.
Centrioles are a very important part of centrosomes, which are involved in organizing microtubules in the cytoplasm.
Centrosomes are associated with the nuclear membrane during prophase of the mitosis.
In mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of the centrosome arranges microtubules such that they interact with the chromosomes to build the mitotic spindle.
Structure of the centrioles
Here the centrosome is shown as a pair of orange cylindrical centrioles.
They are made of nine triplets of microtubules.
