Assume that you have walked across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes and become negatively charged.
If you then reach out to touch a metal doorknob, electrons in the neutral metal will be repelled and move away from your hand before you even touch the knob.
In this way, one end of the doorknob becomes positively charged and the other end becomes negatively charged.
This is called polarization.
Polarization occurs whenever electrons within a neutral object move because of the electric field of a nearby charged object.
It occurs without direct contact between the two objects.
The Figure below models how polarization occurs.
Objects can get polarized when charged objects are nearby
Q:
What happens when the negatively charged plastic rod in the diagram is placed close to the neutral metal plate?
A:
Electrons in the plate are repelled by the positive charges in the rod.
The electrons move away from the rod, causing one side of the plate to become positively charged and the other side to become negatively charged.
Did you ever rub an inflated balloon against your hair?
You can see what happens in the Figure below .
Friction between the balloon and hair cause electrons from the hair to “rub off” on the balloon.
That’s because a balloon attracts electrons more strongly than hair does.
After the transfer of electrons, the balloon becomes negatively charged and the hair becomes positively charged.
The individual hairs push away from each other and stand on end because like charges repel each other.
The balloon and the hair attract each other because opposite charges attract.
