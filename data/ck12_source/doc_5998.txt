Many examples in this category are reactions that produce water.
When aqueous hydrochloric acid is reacted with aqueous sodium hydroxide, the products are aqueous sodium chloride and water.
\text{HCl}(aq)+\text{NaOH}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
Sample Problem:
Double-Replacement Reactions
Write a complete and balanced chemical equation for the following double-replacement reactions.
One product is indicated as a guide.
A.  \text{NaCN}(aq)+\text{HBr}(aq) \rightarrow  (hydrogen cyanide gas is formed)
B.  (\text{NH}_4)_2\text{SO}_4(aq)+\text{Ba(NO}_3)_2(aq) \rightarrow (a precipitate of barium sulfate forms)
Step 1:
Plan the problem
In A, the production of a gas drives the reaction.
In B, the production of a precipitate drives the reaction.
In both cases, use the ionic charges of both reactants to construct the correct formulas of the products.
Step 2:
Solve
A.
The cations of both reactants are +1 charged ions, while the anions are -1 charged ions.
After exchanging partners, the balanced equation is:
\text{NaCN}(aq)+\text{HBr}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaBr}(aq)+\text{HCN}(g)
