What alien planet is represented by this picture?
Would it surprise you to learn that the picture represents Earth?
After Earth first formed about 4.6 billion years ago, it may well have looked like this.
Instead of rivers of water, rivers of molten rock flowed over its surface.
Life as we know it could not have survived in such a place.
How did this fiery hot planet become today’s Earth, covered with water and teeming with life?
The long and incredible story of Earth’s history starts with this section.
How Earth Formed:
We Are Made of Stardust!
We’ll start the story of life at the very beginning, when Earth and the rest of the solar system first formed.
The solar system began as a rotating cloud of stardust. “Dust, rocks, and gas” may not sound inspiring, but this cloud contained the 92 elements which somehow combine to form every corner – living and nonliving – of Earth.
Then the Big Bang (14 billion years ago) produced the atoms of hydrogen and helium.
Elements as heavy as lithium followed the Big Bang within minutes.
Stars such as red giants fused hydrogen and helium nuclei to form elements from carbon (the foundation of life) to calcium (now our bones and teeth).
Supernova explosions formed and ejected heavier elements such as iron (for red blood cells).
