The release of that energy does two things.
Some of the potential energy is transformed into work, which is used to move the car.
At the same time, some of the potential energy is converted to heat, making the carâ€™s engine very hot.
The energy changes of a system occur as either heat or work, or some combination of both.
The fuel of a dragster contains large amounts of potential energy
A dragster is able to accelerate because of the chemical potential energy of its fuel.
The burning of the fuel also produces large amounts of heat.
Dynamite is another example of chemical potential energy.
The major component of dynamite is nitroglycerin, a very unstable material.
By mixing it with diatomaceous earth, the stability is increased and it is less likely to explode if it receives a physical shock.
When ignited, the nitroglycerin explodes rapidly, releasing large amounts of nitrogen and other gases along with a massive amount of heat.
When dynamite detonates, a large amount of potential energy is suddenly released
Chemical potential energy is energy available in the chemical bonds of a compound.
