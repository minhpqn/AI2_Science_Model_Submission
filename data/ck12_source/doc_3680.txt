Zooming in on chromosome and chromatids
The human genome has 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the nucleus of somatic cells.
Each chromosome is composed of genes and other DNA wound around histones (proteins) into a tightly coiled molecule.
The human species is characterized by 23 pairs of chromosomes, as shown in Figure below .

Human Chromosomes.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Pairs 1-22 are autosomes.
Females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y chromosome.
Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, 22 pairs are autosomes (numbers 1â€“22 in Figure above ).
Autosomes are chromosomes that contain genes for characteristics that are unrelated to sex.
These chromosomes are the same in males and females.
The great majority of human genes are located on autosomes.
At the link below, you can click on any human chromosome to see which traits its genes control.
The remaining pair of human chromosomes consists of the sex chromosomes , X and Y.
Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome.
In females, one of the X chromosomes in each cell is inactivated and known as a Barr body.
This ensures that females, like males, have only one functioning copy of the X chromosome in each cell.
As you can see from Figure above and Figure above , the X chromosome is much larger than the Y chromosome.
