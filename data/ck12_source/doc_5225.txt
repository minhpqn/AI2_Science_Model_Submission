The probability of any single offspring showing the dominant trait is 3:1, or 75%.
To develop a Punnett square, possible combinations of alleles in a gamete are placed on the top and left side of a square.
For a monohybrid cross ( Table below ), individual alleles are used, whereas for a dihybrid cross ( Table below ), pairs of alleles are used.
A Punnett square for a monohybrid cross is divided into four squares, whereas a Punnett square for a dihybrid cross is divided into 16 squares.
How many boxes would a Punnett square need if three traits were examined?
The squares are filled in with the possible combinations of alleles formed when gametes combine, such as in a zygote.
See Genetic inheritance follows rules at for an animation of Reginald Punnett discussing his work.
This Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygotes, Bb.
Do you know where each letter (allele) in all four cells comes from?
Two pea plants, both heterozygous for flower color, are crossed.
The offspring will show the dominant purple coloration in a 3:1 ratio.
Or, about 75% of the offspring will be purple.

Predicting Offspring Genotypes
In the cross shown in Figure above , you can see that one out of four offspring (25 percent) has the genotype BB , one out of four (25 percent) has the genotype bb , and two out of four (50 percent) have the genotype Bb .
These percents of genotypes are what you would expect in any cross between two heterozygous parents.
Of course, when just four offspring are produced, the actual percents of genotypes may vary by chance from the expected percents.
However, if you considered hundreds of such crosses and thousands of offspring, you would get very close to the expected resultsâ€”just like tossing a coin.
