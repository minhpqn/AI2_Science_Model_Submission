Flight feathers are long, stiff and waterproof.
They provide lift and air resistance without adding weight.
Down feathers are short and fluffy.
They trap air next to a bird’s skin for insulation.
Types of Bird Feathers.
These two types of bird feathers have different uses.
How is each feather’s structure related to its function?
Organ Systems Adapted for Flight
Birds need a light-weight body in order to stay aloft.
Even so, flying is hard work, and flight muscles need a constant supply of oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood.
The organ systems of birds are adapted to meet these needs.
Birds have light-weight bones that are filled with air.
They also lack a jaw, which in many vertebrates is a dense, heavy bone with many teeth.
Instead, birds have a light-weight keratin beak without teeth.
Birds have air sacs that store inhaled air and push it into the lungs like bellows.
This keeps the lungs constantly filled with oxygenated air.
The lungs also contain millions of tiny passages that create a very large surface area for gas exchange with the blood (see Figure below ).
Birds have a relatively large, four-chambered heart.
The heart beats rapidly to keep oxygenated blood flowing to muscles and other tissues.
Hummingbirds have the fastest heart rate at up to 1,200 beats per minute.
