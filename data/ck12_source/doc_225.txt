We can add vectors mathematically using trig functions, the law of cosines, or the Pythagorean theorem.
If the vectors to be added are at right angles to each other, such as the example above, we would assign them to the sides of a right triangle and calculate the sum as the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
We would also calculate the direction of the sum vector by using an inverse sin or some other trig function.
Suppose, however, that we wish to add two vectors that are not at right angles to each other.
Let’s consider the vectors in the following images.
Two vectors on a north-south, east-west grid, one originating between north and east, one originating between north and west
The two vectors we are to add are a force of 65 N at 30° north of east and a force of 35 N at 60° north of west.
We know that vectors in the same dimension can be added by regular arithmetic.
Therefore, we can resolve each of these vectors into components that lay on the axes as pictured below.
The  resolution of vectors  reduces each vector to a component on the north-south axis and a component on the east-west axis.
Sum of two vectors on a north-south, east-west grid, creating a triangle for each vector
After resolving each vector into two components, we can now mathematically determine the magnitude of the components.
Once we have done that, we can add the components in the same direction arithmetically.
This will give us two vectors that are perpendicular to each other and can be the legs of a right triangle.
The east-west component of the first vector is (65 N)(cos 30°) = (65 N)(0.866) = 56.3 N north
The north-south component of the first vector is (65 N)(sin 30°) = (65 N)(0.500) = 32.5 N north
The east-west component of the second vector is (35 N)(cos 60°) = (35 N)(0.500) = 17.5 N west
The north-south component of the second vector is (35 N)(sin 60°) = (35 N)(0.866) = 30.3 N north
The sum of the two east-west components is 56.3 N - 17.5 N = 38.8 N east
The sum of the two north-south components is 32.5 N + 30.3 N = 62.8 N north
