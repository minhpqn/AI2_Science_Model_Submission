Its shape causes the ship to displace much more water than the ball.
In fact, the weight of the displaced water is greater than the weight of the ship.
As a result, the buoyant force is greater than the force of gravity acting on the ship, so the ship floats.
Q :
Why might you be more likely to float in water if you stretch out your body rather than curl up into a ball?
A :
You would displace more water by stretching out your body, so there would be more buoyant force acting on it.
Therefore, you would be more likely to float in this position.
Archimedes determined that an object displaces the same volume of fluid as its own volume.
According to Archimedes’ law, the buoyant force acting on an object equals the weight of the fluid that the object displaces.
The shape of an object may affect how much fluid it displaces and therefore the buoyant force acting on it.
This explains why one object may sink while another object with the same weight but a different shape may float.

Fill in the missing word in the following sentence:
An object will float in a fluid when the weight of the fluid displaced by the object is _______ than the weight of the object.
Demonstrate how the shape of an object affects its ability to float using a container of water and two pieces of aluminum foil that are the same size and therefore the same weight. (Hint:
Form the two pieces of foil into different shapes.)
Relate work to force and distance.
