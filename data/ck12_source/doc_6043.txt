The Kelvin temperature scale is the scale that is based on molecular motion and so absolute zero is also called 0 K.
The Kelvin temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles of the substance.
For example, the particles in a sample of hydrogen gas at 200 K have twice the average kinetic energy as the particles in a hydrogen sample at 100 K.
Liquid helium has very low kinetic energy because of its low absolute temperature
Helium gas liquefies at 4 K or four degrees above absolute zero.
Liquid helium is used as a coolant for large superconducting magnets and must be stored in insulated metal canisters.
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.
At a given temperature, individual particles of a substance have a range of kinetic energies.
The motion of particles theoretically ceases at absolute zero.
Watch the presentation and take the quiz at the end:
What is kinetic energy?
If the temperature increases, will particles move faster or slower that they would ata lower temperature?
What is absolute zero?
List one use for liquid helium.
absolute zero:
The temperature at which the motion of particles theoretically ceases.
Kelvin scale:
The scale that is based on molecular motion and so absolute zero is also called 0 K.
kinetic energy:
The energy of motion.
