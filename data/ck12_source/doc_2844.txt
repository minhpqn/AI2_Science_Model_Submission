Diagram illustrating carbon-14 dating
Q:
Why can’t carbon-14 dating be used to date specimens older than about 60,000 years?
A:
Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5700 years.
After about 60,000 years, too little carbon-14 is left in a specimen to be measured.
The age of a rock or other specimen can be estimated from the remaining amount of a radioisotope it contains and the radioisotope’s known rate of decay, or half-life.
This method of dating specimens is called radioactive dating.
Radioisotopes with longer half-lives are used to date older specimens, and those with shorter half-lives are used to date younger ones.
Carbon-14 dating is used to date specimens younger than about 60,000 years old.
It is commonly used to date fossils of living things and human artifacts.

What is the half-life of carbon-14?
What is the half-life of uranium-238?
Compare the decay rates of carbon-14 and uranium-238.
How long does it take for 75 percent of a sample of carbon-14 atoms to decay?
How long does it take for 75 percent of a sample of uranium-238 to decay?
Do these rates depend on the number of atoms in the samples?
What percentage of carbon-14 remains in a sample after 10,000 years?
How many years does it take for uranium-238 to decay to this same percentage?
