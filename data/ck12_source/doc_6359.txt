\text{AgNO}_3(aq)+\text{NaCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaNO}_3(aq)+\text{AgCl}(s)
The entropy is decreasing because a solid is formed from aqueous reactants.
\text{H}_2 (g)+\text{Cl}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{HCl}(g)
The entropy change is unknown (but likely not zero), because there are equal numbers of molecules on both sides of the equation and all are gases.
Entropy is defined.
Situations involving entropy changes are described.
Read the material at the link below and answer the questions:
Indicate whether entropy increases or decreases in each of the following situations:
The jigsaw puzzle is taken apart and put back in the box.
Clothes are folded and put away.
ice  \rightarrow steam.
\text{Pb(NO}_3)_2(aq)+2\text{KI}(aq) \rightarrow \text{PbI}_2(s)+2 \text{KNO}_3
entropy:
A measure of the degree of randomness or disorder of a system.
Perform change in entropy calculations involving standard entropy.
Geothermal heat sources are a potential source of energy
How much energy is available?
As scientists explore energy supplies, geothermal sources look very appealing.
The natural geysers that exist in some parts of the world could possibly be harnessed to provide power for many purposes.
The change in energy content and the release of energy caused by steam condensing to liquid can help fill some of our growing energy needs.
