Kidneys are organs that filter wastes from blood so they can be excreted from the body.
Vertebrates have an endocrine system of glands that secrete hormones.
Hormones are chemical messengers that control many body functions.
Vertebrates have an adaptive immune system.
The immune system is the organ system that defends the body from pathogens and other causes of disease.
Being adaptive means that the immune system can "learn" to recognize specific pathogens.
Then it can produce tailor-made proteins called antibodies to "attack" them.
This allows the immune system to launch a rapid attack whenever the pathogens invade the body again.
Vertebrates have a centralized nervous system.
As shown in Figure below , the nervous system consists of a brain in the head region.
It also includes a long spinal cord that runs from the brain to the tail end of the backbone.
Long nerve fibers extend from the spinal cord to muscles and organs throughout the body.
Human nervous system
Nervous System (Human).
The vertebrate nervous system includes a brain and spinal cord.
It also includes a body-wide network of nerves, called peripheral nerves.
They connect the spinal cord with the rest of the body.
Vertebrates are a subphylum of chordates that have a vertebral column and an endoskeleton made of cartilage or bone.
Vertebrates also have complex organ systems, including a closed circulatory system with a heart, an excretory system with a pair of kidneys, and an adaptive immune system.
