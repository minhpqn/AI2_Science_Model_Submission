Amphibians evolved about 365 million years ago from a lobe-finned fish ancestor.
As the earliest land vertebrates, amphibians were highly successful for more than 100 million years until reptiles took over as the dominant land vertebrates.
Amphibians are found throughout the world except in Antarctica and Greenland.
Amphibians are important prey for animals such as birds, snakes, and raccoons.
They are important predators of insects, worms, and other invertebrates.
Up to one third of all amphibian species are at risk of extinction because of human actions, such as habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution.
