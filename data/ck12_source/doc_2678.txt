How do reactants change into products during a chemical reaction?
Give examples of irreversible and reversible chemical reactions.
Describe a reversible reaction that is in equilibrium.
This diagram represents a chemical reaction.
In the reaction, two molecules of hydrogen gas (2 H-H) combine one molecule of oxygen gas (O=O) to produce two molecules of water (2 H-O-H).
Look at the arrow in the diagram.
What does it represent?
It shows that the reaction normally occurs in that direction, that is, from the two gases to water.
Does the opposite reaction ever occur?
Can water change back to hydrogen and oxygen gases?
In other words, is the reaction reversible?
Read on to find out.
Some chemical reactions can occur in only one direction.
These reactions are called irreversible reactions.
The reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants.
These reactions are like making a cake.
The ingredients of a cake—such as eggs and flour—are the reactants.
They are mixed together and baked to form the cake, which is the product (see Figure below ).
The cake can’t be “unbaked” and “unmixed” to change it back to the raw eggs, flour, and other ingredients.
So making a cake is irreversible.
