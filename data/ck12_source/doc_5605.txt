Two-Step Metric Conversion
Convert 4.3 cm to μm.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
1 m = 100 cm
1 m = 10 6 μm
4.3 cm = ? μm
You may need to consult a table for the multiplication factor represented by each metric prefix.
First convert cm to m, followed by a conversion of m to μm.
Step 2:
Calculate
4.3 \ \text{cm} \times \frac{1 \ \text{m}}{100 \ \text{cm}} \times \frac{10^6 \ \mu \text{m}}{1 \ \text{m}}=43, 000 \ \mu \text{m}
Each conversion factor is written so that unit of the denominator cancels with the unit of the numerator of the previous factor.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
A micrometer is a smaller unit of length than a centimeter, so the answer in micrometers is larger than the number of centimeters given.
