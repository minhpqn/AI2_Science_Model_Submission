The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus.
The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are neutral in charge.
The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2.

Q:
There are six protons in each atom of carbon.
What is the electrical charge of a carbon nucleus?
A:
The electrical charge of a carbon nucleus is +6.
What Are Protons Made of?
Protons are made of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.
As you can see in the Figure below , a proton contains three quarks (colored circles) and three streams of gluons (wavy white lines).
Two of the quarks are called up quarks (u), and the third quark is called a down quark (d).
The gluons carry the strong nuclear force between quarks, binding them together.
This force is needed to overcome the electric force of repulsion between positive protons.
Although protons were discovered almost 100 years ago, the quarks and gluons inside them were discovered much more recently.
Scientists are still learning more about these fundamental particles.
