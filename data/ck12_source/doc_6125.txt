Sample Problem:
Graham’s Law
Calculate the ratio of diffusion rates of ammonia gas (NH 3 ) to hydrogen chloride (HCl) at the same temperature and pressure.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
molar mass NH 3 = 17.04 g/mol
molar mass HCl = 36.46 g/mol
velcoity ratio  \dfrac{v_{\text{NH}_3}}{v_{\text{HCl}}}
Substitute the molar masses of the gases into Graham’s law and solve for the ratio.
Step 2:
Solve.
\frac{v_{NH_3}}{v_{HCl}}=\sqrt{\frac{36.46 \text{ g/mol}}{17.04 \text{ g/mol}}}=1.46
The rate of diffusion of ammonia is 1.46 times faster than the rate of diffusion of hydrogen chloride.
Step 3:
Think about your result
Since ammonia has a smaller molar mass than hydrogen chloride, the velocity of its molecules is greater and the velocity ratio is larger than 1.
The processes of gas diffusion and effusion are described.
Graham’s law relates the molecular mass of a gas to its rate of diffusion or effusion.
