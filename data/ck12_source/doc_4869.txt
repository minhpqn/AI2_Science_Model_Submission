Two Types of Cells - Advanced
Define prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
Describe common features of prokaryotic cells.
Compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
How many different types of cells are there?
There are many different types of cells.
For example, in you there are blood cells and skin cells and bone cells and even bacteria.
Here we have drawings of bacteria and animal cells.
Can you tell which depicts various types of bacteria?
However, all cells - whether from bacteria, human, or any other organism - will be one of two general types: prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
In fact, all cells other than bacteria will be one type, and bacterial cells will be the other.
And it all depends on how the cell stores its DNA.
Two Types of Cells
There are two cell types: prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Prokaryotic cells are usually single-celled and smaller than eukaryotic cells.
Eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms, but there are some single-celled eukaryotes.
Diagram of a typical prokaryotic cell.
Among other things, prokaryotic cells have a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA.
Prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles or a cell nucleus.
