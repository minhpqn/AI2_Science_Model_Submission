All polar compounds contain polar bonds.
But having polar bonds does not necessarily result in a polar compound.
It depends on how the atoms are arranged.
This is illustrated in the Figure below .
In both molecules, the oxygen atoms attract electrons more strongly than the carbon or hydrogen atoms do, so both molecules have polar bonds.
However, only formaldehyde is a polar compound.
Carbon dioxide is nonpolar.
Polarity of formaldehyde and carbon dioxide
Q:
Why is carbon dioxide nonpolar?
A:
The symmetrical arrangement of atoms in carbon dioxide results in opposites sides of the molecule having the same charge.
In polar covalent bonds, electrons are not shared equally between the two atoms, so one atom is slightly negative in charge and one is slightly positive in charge.
In nonpolar covalent bonds, electrons are shared equally so the atoms remain neutral in charge.
Covalent compounds with polar bonds may be polar or nonpolar, depending on their arrangement of atoms.
