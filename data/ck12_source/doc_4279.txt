The sea anemone.
Plant or animal?
It may look like a plant, but it's not.
Sea anemones are a group of water-dwelling, predatory animals in the phylum Cnidaria.
A sea anemone is a polyp attached at the bottom to the surface beneath it.
They can have anywhere from a few tens of tentacles to a few hundred tentacles.
And they eat small fish and shrimp.
Cnidarians are invertebrates such as jellyfish and corals.
They belong to the phylum Cnidaria.
All cnidarians are aquatic.
Most of them live in the ocean.
Cnidarians are a little more complex than sponges.
They have radial symmetry and tissues.
There are more than 10,000 cnidarian species.
They are very diverse, as shown in Figure below .
See The First to Move at and Biology of Cnidarians at  for an overview of these animals.
