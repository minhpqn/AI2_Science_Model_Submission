The kinetic energy of a moving object depends on its mass and its
The bowling ball in the Figure below is whizzing down the bowling lane at 4 m/s.
If the mass of the bowling ball is 7 kg, what is its kinetic energy?
Bowling balls have kinetic energy
Define potential energy.
Show how to calculate gravitational potential energy.
Describe elastic potential energy.
Identify other forms of potential energy.
This diver has just jumped up from the end of the diving board.
After she dives down and is falling toward the water, she’ll have kinetic energy, or the energy of moving matter.
But even as she is momentarily stopped high above the water, she has energy.
Do you know why?
The diver has energy because of her position high above the pool.
The type of energy she has is called potential energy.
Potential energy is energy that is stored in a person or object.
Often, the person or object has potential energy because of its position or shape.
Q:
What is it about the diver’s position that gives her potential energy?
A:
Because the diver is high above the water, she has the potential to fall toward Earth because of gravity.
