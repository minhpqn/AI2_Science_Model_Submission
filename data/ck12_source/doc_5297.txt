This real possibility is usually due to mistakes during meiosis; the chromosomes do not fully separate from each other during sperm or egg formation.
Specifically, nondisjunction is the failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during anaphase II.
If a zygote forms from a gamete lacking a chromosome, a viable embryo cannot be produced.
Most human abnormal chromosome numbers result in the death of the developing embryo, often before a woman even realizes she is pregnant.
Occasionally, a zygote with an extra chromosome can become a viable embryo and develop.
Trisomy is a state where humans have an extra autosome.
That is, they have three of a particular chromosome instead of two.
For example, trisomy 18 results from an extra chromosome 18, resulting in 47 total chromosomes.
To identify the chromosome number (including an abnormal number), a sample of cells is removed from an individual or developing fetus.
Metaphase chromosomes are photographed and a karyotype is produced.
A karyotype will display any abnormalities in chromosome number or large chromosomal rearrangements.
Trisomy 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 21 have been identified in humans.
Trisomy 16 is the most common trisomy in humans, occurring in more than 1% of pregnancies.
This condition, however, usually results in spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester.
The most common trisomy in viable births is Trisomy 21 .
Trisomy 21:
Down Syndrome
One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ).
Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy where an affected individual may survive to adulthood.
Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance.
