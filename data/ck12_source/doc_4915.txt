Hydrogen peroxide is toxic, and in turn is broken down into water (H 2 O) and oxygen (O 2 ) molecules.
Secretory Vesicles contain materials that are to be excreted from the cell, such as wastes or hormones .
Secretory vesicles include synaptic vesicles and vesicles in endocrine tissues.
Synaptic vesicles store neurotransmitters.
They are located at presynaptic terminals in neurons.
When a signal reaches the end of an axon, the synaptic vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release the neurotransmitter.
The neurotransmitter crosses the synaptic junction, and binds to a receptor on the next cell.
Some cells also produce molecules, such as hormones produced by endocrine tissues, needed by other cells.
These molecules are stored in secretory vesicles and released when needed.
Secretory vesicles also hold enzymes needed to make extracellular structures, such as the extracellular matrix of animal cells.
Vesicles and Transport
Most vesicles are involved in transporting some sort of molecule, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter.
These vesicles must first form around the substance being transported.
This requires numerous vesicle coats to surround and bind to the proteins being transported.
They also trap various transmembrane receptor proteins, called cargo receptors, which in turn trap the cargo molecules.
The Vesicle Coat
The vesicle coat selects specific proteins as cargo.
It selects cargo proteins by binding to sorting signals.
These complexes cluster in the membrane, forming a vesicle buds, or coated pit .
There are three types of vesicle coats: clathrin , COPI and COPII.
