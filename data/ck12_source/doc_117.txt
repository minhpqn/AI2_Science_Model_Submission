One birdâ€™s flight.
About 60 living bird species are flightless, such as penguins, as were many extinct birds.
Flightlessness often evolves when birds live on isolated islands.
The absence of land predators might make flying no longer necessary.
Other birds evolved into new niches where flying was no longer necessary.
This may have been in response to limited resources.
For example, the flightless cormorant can no longer fly, but its wings are now adapted to swim in the sea ( Figure below ).

A flightless cormorant can no longer fly, but it uses its wings for swimming.
Birds are endothermic (warm-blooded), have beaks, and lay eggs.
Adaptations for flight include a lightweight skeleton and flexible neck bones.
