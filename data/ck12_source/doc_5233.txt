A dihybrid cross-examines the inheritance of two traits at the same time.
Dihybrid crosses are more complicated than monohybrid crosses.
With unlinked genes, a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio will result in the offspring of a cross of two completely heterozygous individuals.
The following are problems associated with the link below.
