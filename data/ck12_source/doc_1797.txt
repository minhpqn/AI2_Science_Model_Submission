How is chemical weathering altering the landscape?
Chemical weathering is different than mechanical weathering.
The minerals in the rock change their chemical makeup.
They become a different type of mineral or even a different type of rock.
Chemical weathering works through chemical reactions that change the rock.
No Longer Stable
Most minerals form deep within Earth's crust.
At these depths, temperatures and pressures are much higher than at the surface.
Minerals that were stable deeper in the crust are not stable under surface conditions.
Thatâ€™s why chemical weathering happens.
Minerals that formed at higher temperature and pressure change into minerals that are stable at the surface.
Agents of Chemical Weathering
There are many agents of chemical weathering.
Remember that water was a main agent of mechanical weathering.
Well, water is also an agent of chemical weathering.
That makes it a double agent!
Carbon dioxide and oxygen are also agents of chemical weathering.
Each of these is discussed below.
Water is an amazing molecule.
It has a very simple chemical formula, H 2 O.
