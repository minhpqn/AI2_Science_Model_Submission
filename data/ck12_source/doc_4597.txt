Identify three types of barriers in the body’s first line of defense.
Give an example of each type of barrier.
Which type of pathogen causes the common cold?
Which type causes athlete’s foot?
Inflammatory Response and Leukocytes
Explain the inflammatory response.
Describe cytokines and histamines.
Outline how nonspecific leukocytes help fight pathogens that enter the body.
What happens when an enemy gets past the first line of defense?
For this running back to make it past the first line of defense, there usually has to be a hole or break in the line.
He then runs into the secondary, or the second line of defense.
Whenever the skin is broken, it is possible for pathogens to easily enter your body.
They get past the first line of defense, and run into the second line of defense.
The Second Line of Defense
If you have a cut on your hand, the break in the skin provides a way for pathogens to enter your body.
Assume bacteria enter through the cut and infect the wound.
These bacteria would then encounter the body’s second line of defense.
The cut on your hand may become red, warm, and swollen.
These are signs of an inflammatory response.
This is the first reaction of the body to tissue damage or infection.
