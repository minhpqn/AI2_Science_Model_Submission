What is the outcome of glycolysis?
What is produced during the Krebs cycle?
What occurs during the electron transport system?
Cellular Respiration at
Define cellular respiration.
What are the three stages of cellular respiration?
Describe the structure of the mitochondrion and discuss the importance of this structure in cellular respiration.
Assume that a new species of organism has been discovered.
Scientists have observed its cells under a microscope and determined that they lack mitochondria.
What type of cellular respiration would you predict that the new species uses?
Explain your prediction.
When you exhale onto a cold window pane, water vapor in your breath condenses on the glass.
Where does the water vapor come from?
List the products of glycolysis.
How do you slice a molecule of glucose in half?
With sharp knives?
Not really.
But you essentially slice it in half through glycolysis.
This is an extremely important part of cellular respiration.
It happens all the time, both with and without oxygen.
