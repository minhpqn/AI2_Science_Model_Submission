Yes, some air can be harmful.
Air Pollution and Illness
Almost 5 million people die each year because of air pollution .
In fact, polluted air causes more deaths than traffic accidents.
Air pollution harms the respiratory and circulatory systems.
Both outdoor and indoor air can be polluted.
Outdoor Air Pollution
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an assessment of the pollutants in the outdoor air based on their human health effects.
The health risks associated with different values of AQI are shown in Figure below .
When AQI is high, you should limit the time you spend outdoors.
Avoiding exposure to air pollution can help limit its impact on your health.
People with certain health problems, including asthma, are very sensitive to the effects of air pollution.
They need to be especially careful to avoid it.
EPA air quality index
Air quality is especially important for sensitive people.
They include people with asthma, other respiratory illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases.
AQI generally refers to the levels of ground-level ozone and particulates.
Ozone is a gas that forms close to the ground when air pollutants are heated by sunlight.
It is one of the main components of smog (see Figure below ).
Smog also contains particulates.
