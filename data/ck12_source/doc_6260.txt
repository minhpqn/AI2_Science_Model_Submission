A frequently used and inexpensive calorimeter is a set of nested foam cups fitted with a lid to limit the heat exchange between the liquid in the cup and the air in the surroundings (see Figure below ).
In a typical calorimetry experiment, specific volumes of the reactants are dispensed into separate containers and the temperature of each is measured.
They are then mixed into the calorimeter, which starts the reaction.
The reactant mixture is stirred until the reaction is complete, while the temperature of the reaction is continuously monitored.
A simple constant-pressure calorimeter can be produced using styrofoam cups
A simple constant-pressure calorimeter.
The key to all calorimetry experiments is the assumption that there is no heat exchange between the insulated calorimeter and the room.
Consider the case of a reaction taking place between aqueous reactants.
The water in which the solids have been dissolved is the surroundings, while the dissolved substances are the system.
The temperature change that is measured is the temperature change that is occurring in the surroundings.
If the temperature of the water increases as the reaction occurs, the reaction is exothermic.
Heat was released by the system into the surrounding water.
An endothermic reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings, so the temperature of the water decreases as heat leaves the surroundings to enter the system.
The temperature change of the water is measured in the experiment and the specific heat of water can be used to calculate the heat absorbed by the surroundings (q_{\text{surr}}) .
q_{\text{surr}}=m \times c_p \times \Delta T
In the equation,  m is the mass of the water,  c_p is the specific heat of the water, and  \Delta T is T_f - T_i .
The heat absorbed by the surroundings is equal, but opposite in sign, to the heat released by the system.
Because the heat change is determined at constant pressure, the heat released by the system  (q_{\text{sys}}) is equal to the enthalpy change (\Delta H) .
q_{\text{sys}}=\Delta H=-q_{\text{surr}}=-(m \times c_p \times \Delta T)
The sign of  \Delta H is positive for an endothermic reaction and negative for an exothermic reaction.
