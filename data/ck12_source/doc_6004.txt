Step 3:
Think about your result.
The 8 ham slices will make 4 ham sandwiches.
With 5 pickles per sandwich, the 20 pickles are used in the 4 sandwiches.
An example of everyday stoichiometry is given.
Use the link below to answer the following questions:
What does stoichiometry help you figure out?
What are all reactions dependent upon?
If I have ten hydrogen molecules and three oxygen molecules, how many molecules of water can I make?
What will be left over and how much?
I donâ€™t like pickles.
What would my ideal ham sandwich be?
How does that change the equation?
Will this change affect the amounts of other materials?
stoichiometry:
The calculation of amounts of substances in a chemical reaction from the balanced equation.
Define mole ratio.
Use mole ratios to determine amounts of materials involved in a reaction.
Making a porch requires a certain ratio of lumber
What does this porch need?
