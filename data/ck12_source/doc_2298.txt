This type of reasoning is the basis of the scientific method.
In science, inductive reasoning is used to draw general conclusions from evidence.
The conclusions are changed if necessary to explain new evidence as it becomes available.
Inductive reasoning cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true, but it may lead to conclusions that are very likely to be true.
Deductive reasoning is another type of reasoning.
You can think of deductive reasoning as inductive reasoning in reverse.
With deductive reasoning, you draw specific conclusions based on general statements that are assumed to be true.

What is inductive reasoning?
Describe how inductive reasoning is used in science.
Rayna studied rats in a lab.
She observed that all 50 rats in her sample preferred to eat brand A rat food and would eat brand B food only when brand A was not available.
Can she correctly conclude that all rats prefer brand A rat food over brand B food?
Why or why not?
