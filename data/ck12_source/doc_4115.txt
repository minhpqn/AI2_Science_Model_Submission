In this way, selective breeding of the cows would increase milk quality and quantity.
Humans have also artificially bred dogs to create new breeds ( Figure below ).
Artificial selection created these different breeds of dogs
Artificial Selection:
Humans used artificial selection to create these different breeds.
Both dog breeds are descended from the same wolves, and their genes are almost identical.
There are two main ways that speciation happens naturally.
Both processes create new species by reproductively isolating populations of the same species from each other.
Organisms can be geographically isolated or isolated by a behavior.
Either way, they will no longer be able to mate.
Over a long period of time, usually thousands of years, each of the isolated populations evolves in a different direction, forming distinct species.
How do you think scientists test whether two populations are separate species?
They bring species from two populations back together again.
If the two populations do not mate and produce fertile offspring, they are separate species.
Allopatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species are geographically isolated for long periods.
Imagine all the ways that plants or animals could be isolated from each other:
Emergence of a mountain range.
Formation of a canyon.
New rivers or streams.
Here are two examples of allopatric speciation:
