DNA is found in chromosomes.
In eukaryotic cells, chromosomes always remain in the nucleus, but proteins are made at ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
How do the instructions in DNA get to the site of protein synthesis outside the nucleus?
Another type of nucleic acid is responsible.
This nucleic acid is RNA , or ribonucleic acid.
RNA is a small molecule that can squeeze through pores in the nuclear membrane.
It carries the information from DNA in the nucleus to a ribosome in the cytoplasm and then helps assemble the protein.
In short:
DNA → RNA → Protein
Discovering this sequence of events was a major milestone in molecular biology.
It is called the central dogma of molecular biology .
You can watch a video about the central dogma and other concepts in this lesson at this link:
The vocabulary of DNA, including the two processes involved in the central dogma, transcription and translation , is discussed at

An overview of protein synthesis can be viewed at
The central dogma of molecular biology states that DNA contains instructions for making a protein, which are copied by RNA.
RNA then uses the instructions to make a protein.
In short:
DNA → RNA → Protein, or DNA to RNA to Protein.
