Why would we want to correct for water vapor?
A student wants to collect his gas over diethyl ether (vapor pressure of 530 mm Hg at 25°C).
Is this a good idea?
Explain your answer.
water displacement:
Collection of a gas over water.
Diffusion and Effusion and Graham's Law
Define diffusion and effusion.
State Graham’s law.
Use Graham’s law to perform calculations involving movement of gases.
A classic experiment to find the rate of diffusion for gases uses hydrochloric acid and ammonia
How do we know how fast a gas moves?
We usually cannot see gases, so we need ways to detect their movements indirectly.
The relative rates of diffusion of ammonia to hydrogen chloride can be observed in a simple experiment.
Cotton balls are soaked with solutions of ammonia and hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) and attached to two different rubber stoppers.
These are simultaneously plugged into either end of a long glass tube.
The vapors of each travel down the tube at different rates.
Where the vapors meet, they react to form ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), a white solid that appears in the glass tube as a ring.
When a person opens a bottle of perfume in one corner of a large room, it doesn’t take very long for the scent to spread throughout the entire room.
Molecules of the perfume evaporate and the vapor spreads out to fill the entire space.
