Conversions Between Moles and Number of Particles
Using our unit conversion techniques, we can use the mole label to convert back and forth between the number of particles and moles.
Sample Problem 1:
Converting Number of Particles to Moles
The element carbon exists in two primary forms: graphite and diamond.
How many moles of carbon atoms is 4.72 × 10 24 atoms of carbon?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
number of C atoms = 4.72 × 10 24
1 mole = 6.02 × 10 23 atoms
4.72 × 10 24 = ? mol C
One conversion factor will allow us to convert from the number of C atoms to moles of C atoms.
Step 2:
Calculate.
4.72 \times 10^{24}\ \text{atoms C} \times \frac{1 \ \text{mol C}}{6.02 \times 10^{23}\ \text{atoms C}}=7.84 \ \text{mol C}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The given number of carbon atoms was greater than Avogadro’s number, so the number of moles of C atoms is greater than 1 mole.
Since Avogadro’s number is a measured quantity with three significant figures, the result of the calculation is rounded to three significant figures.
Suppose that you wanted to know how many hydrogen atoms were in a mole of water molecules.  First, you would need to know the chemical formula for water, which is H 2 O.  There are two atoms of hydrogen in each molecule of water.  How many atoms of hydrogen would there be in two water molecules?  There would be 2 × 2 = 4 hydrogen atoms.
