It acts almost like the "skin" of the cell, controlling the movement of substances in and out of cells.
The cell membrane is semi-permeable , allowing only select ions and organic molecules to enter and/or leave the cell.
The cell membrane consists of two layers of phospholipids (a lipid bilayer) with embedded proteins which have numerous functions.
More about the cell membrane will be discussed in the The Plasma Membrane (Advanced) concepts.
Cytoplasm is the general term for all of the material inside the cell, excluding the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
All the contents of a prokaryotic cell are contained within the cytoplasm.
Cytoplasm is made up of cytosol , a watery fluid that contains cytoskeletal fragments, dissolved particles and organelles.
Organelles are structures that carry out specific functions inside the cell.
It is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, such as many metabolic pathways and processes such as cell division.
More about the cytoplasm will be discussed in the Cell Structures:
The Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton (Advanced) concept.
Ribosomes are the organelles on which proteins are made during protein synthesis .
Ribosomes are found throughout the cytosol of the cell and attached to the endoplasmic reticulum organelle.
Ribosomes order amino acids using messenger RNA (mRNA) as a template in a process called translation.
Ribosomes are made from complexes of ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) and proteins called ribonucleoproteins .
Each ribosome is divided into two subunits.
The smaller subunit binds to the mRNA pattern, while the larger subunit binds to the transfer RNA (tRNA) and the growing polypeptide chain.
More about the ribosome will be discussed in the Cell Structures:
Ribosomes (Advanced) concept.
All cells also have DNA .
