The properties of metals—as well as of elements in the other classes—depend mainly on the number and arrangement of their electrons.
Explaining the Properties of Metals
To understand why metals can conduct electricity, consider the metal lithium as an example.
An atom of lithium is modeled below.
Look at lithium’s electrons.
There are two electrons at the first energy level.
This energy level can hold only two electrons, so it is full in lithium.
The second energy level is another story.
It can hold a maximum of eight electrons, but in lithium it has just one.
A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Lithium would need to gain seven electrons to fill its outer energy level and make it stable.
It’s far easier for lithium to give up its one electron in energy level 2, leaving it with a full outer energy level (now level 1).
Electricity is a flow of electrons.
Because lithium (like most other metals) easily gives up its “extra” electron, it is a good conductor of electricity.
This tendency to give up electrons also explains other properties of metals such as lithium.
Metals are elements that can conduct electricity.
Most elements are metals.
All metals except for mercury are solids at room temperature.
Many metals are shiny, ductile, and malleable.
Most are also good conductors of heat.
