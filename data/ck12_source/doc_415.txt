Macrophages are large WBCs that can also swallow and destroy old and dying cells, bacteria, or viruses.
Below, a macrophage is attacking and swallowing two particles, possibly disease-causing pathogens ( Figure below ).
Macrophages also release chemical messages that cause the number of WBCs to increase.
Lymphocytes are WBCs that fight infections caused by viruses and bacteria.
Some lymphocytes attack and kill cancer cells.
Lymphocytes called B-cells make antibodies.
White blood cells help attack and kill pathogens and cancer cells
A type of white blood cell, called a macrophage, is attacking a cancer cell.
Platelets ( Figure below ) are very small, but they are very important in blood clotting.
Platelets are not cells.
They are sticky little pieces of larger cells.
Platelets bud off large cells that stay in the bone marrow.
When a blood vessel gets cut, platelets stick to the injured areas.
They release chemicals called clotting factors, which cause proteins to form over the wound.
This web of proteins catches red blood cells and forms a clot.
This clot stops more blood from leaving the body through the cut blood vessel.
The clot also stops bacteria from entering the body.
Platelets survive in the blood for ten days before they are removed by the liver and spleen.
Platelets are parts of a larger cell that help seal wounds
A platelet lies between a red blood cell, at left, and a white blood cell at right.
