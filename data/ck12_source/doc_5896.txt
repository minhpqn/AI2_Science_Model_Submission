Structure of cholesterol
What does cholesterol really look like?
We can write the structure of the cholesterol molecule a couple of different ways.  The simplest approach is to just write C 27 H 46 O.
This “structure” is not very useful because it does not tell us how the carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen are connected to one another.
The structure in the figure above is much more helpful – we see how the different atoms are connected together to form the molecule.
