Tool using in a primate.
A gorilla uses a stick to determine the water's depth.
Most primate species eat both plants and meat ( omnivorous ), but fruit is the preferred food among all but humans.
In contrast, humans eat a large amount of highly processed, low fiber foods, and unusual proportions of grains and vertebrate meat.
As a result of our diets, human teeth and jaws are markedly smaller for our size than those of other apes.
Humans may have been eating cooked food for a million years or more, so perhaps our teeth adapted to eating cooked food.
Gestation (pregnancy) lasts 8-9 months and usually results in the birth of a single offspring.
The young are born helpless, and thus, they need parental care for long periods of time.
Compared with most other mammals, great apes have a long adolescence and are not fully mature until 8-13 years of age (longer in humans).
Females usually give birth only once every few years.
Gorillas and chimpanzees live in family groups of approximately five to ten individuals, although larger groups are sometimes observed.
The groups include at least one dominant male, and females leave the group when they can mate.
Orangutans, however, generally live alone.
Genetic and Behavioral Similarities
Gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans have more than 97% of their DNA sequence in common.
This means that a similar percent of the amino acid sequences of the proteins will be the same, resulting in many proteins with similar or identical functions.
All organisms in the Hominidae communicate with some kind of language.
They can also create simple cultures beyond the family or group of animals.
Having a culture means that knowledge and behaviors can be passed on from generation to generation.
