Another example of a human polygenic trait is adult height.
If human height followed simple Mendelian genetics, than people would either be tall or short, with both phenotypes probably falling into a very narrow range.
But like skin color, humans height fall into essentially a phenotypic spectrum.
Within the human population, every conceivable height between less than 5 feet and over 7 feet probably exists.
This range can not be controlled by just one gene with two alleles.
In fact, several genes, each with more than one allele, contribute to human height, resulting in many possible adult heights.
For example, one adult’s height might be 1.655 m (5.430 feet), and another adult’s height might be 1.656 m (5.433 feet) tall.
Adult height ranges from less than 5 feet to more than 6 feet, but the majority of people fall near the middle of the range, as shown in Figure below .
Human Adult Height.
Like many other polygenic traits, adult height has a bell-shaped distribution.
Many disorders with genetic components are polygenic, including autism, certain cancers, diabetes and numerous others.
Most phenotypic characteristics are the result of the interaction of multiple genes.
The environment plays a significant role in many of these phenotypes.
But what happens when multiple genes are either missing or duplicated?
Changes in Chromosome Number
So far we have focused on traits due to one gene or several genes.
But what about many genes? 100s or 1000s of genes?
What would happen if an entire chromosome were missing or duplicated?
What if a human had only 45 chromosomes?
Or 47?
