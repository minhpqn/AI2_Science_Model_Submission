What's the chance of the coin landing on heads?
What's the chance of inheriting the paternal allele?
Or the maternal allele?
Probability and Genetics
A Mendelian trait is a trait that is controlled by a single gene that has two alleles.
One of these alleles is dominant and the other is recessive.
Many inheritable conditions in humans are passed to offspring in a simple Mendelian fashion.
Medical professionals use Mendel’s laws to predict and understand the inheritance of certain traits in their patients.
Also, farmers, animal breeders, and horticulturists who breed organisms can predict outcomes of crosses by understanding Mendelian inheritance and probability.
Tossing a Coin.
Competitions often begin with the toss of a coin.
Why is this a fair way to decide who goes first?
If you choose heads, what is the chance that the toss will go your way?
Is this similar to the probability of inheriting a particular allele?
The rules of probability that apply to tossing a coin or throwing a die also apply to the laws of segregation and independent assortment.
Probability is the likelihood that a certain event will occur.
It is expressed by comparing the number of events that occur to the total number of possible events.
The equation is written as:
Probability = (number of times an event is expected to occur)/(total number of times an event could happen)
For example, in Mendel’s F 2 hybrid generation, the dominant trait of purple flower color appeared 705 times, and the recessive trait appeared 224 times.
