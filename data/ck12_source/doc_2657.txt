Because valence electrons are shared in covalent compounds, rather than transferred between atoms as they are in ionic compounds, covalent compounds have very different properties than ionic compounds.
Many covalent compounds, especially those containing carbon and hydrogen, burn easily.
In contrast, many ionic compounds do not burn.
Many covalent compounds do not dissolve in water, whereas most ionic compounds dissolve well in water.
Unlike ionic compounds, covalent compounds do not have freely moving electrons, so they cannot conduct electricity.
The individual molecules of covalent compounds are more easily separated than the ions in a crystal, so most covalent compounds have relatively low boiling points.
This explains why many of them are liquids or gases at room temperature.
You can compare the boiling points of some covalent and ionic compounds in the Table below .

Q:
The two covalent compounds in the table are gases at room temperature, which is 20°C.
For a compound to be a liquid at room temperature, what does its boiling point have to be?
A:
To be a liquid at room temperature, a covalent compound has to have a boiling point higher than 20°C.
