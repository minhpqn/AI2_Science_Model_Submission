The surface-area to volume ratio of the large cell is:
Now, replace the three unit cell with enough one unit cells to equal the volume of the single three unit cell.
This can be done with 27 one unit cells.
Find the total surface area of the 27 cells:
1u × 1u × 6 × 27 = 162u 2
The total volume of the block of 27 cells is:
1 × 1 × 1 × 27 = 27u 3
The surface-area to volume ratio of the 27 cells is:
An increased surface area to volume ratio means increased exposure to the environment.
This means that nutrients and gases can move in and out of a small cell more easily than in and out of a larger cell.
Ostrich eggs (A) can weigh as much as 1.5 kg and be 13 cm in diameter, whereas each of the mouse cells (B) shown at right are each about 10 µm in diameter, much smaller than the period at the end of this sentence.
The cells you have learned about so far are much smaller than the period at the end of this sentence, so they are normally measured on a very small scale.
The smallest prokaryotic cell currently known has a diameter of only 400 nm.
Eukaryotic cells normally range between 1– 100µm in diameter.
The mouse cells in Figure above are about 10 µm in diameter.
One exception, however, is eggs .
Eggs contain the largest known single cell, and the ostrich egg is the largest of them all.
The ostrich egg in Figure above is over 10,000 times larger than the mouse cell.
The variety of cell shapes seen in prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the functions that each cell has, confirming the structure-function relationship seen throughout biology.
Each cell type has evolved a shape that is best related to its function.
