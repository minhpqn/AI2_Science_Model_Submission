In fact, evolution can be genetically defined as the change allele frequencies over time.
Mutations are the key to species evolving.
Lets say an organism "mutates" due to a new allele for a gene that determines coat color.
There are, theoretically, only three outcomes of that mutation:
The "new" coat color does not allow the organism to camouflage itself.
The organism dies and the new allele dies with it.
The mutation has no significant effect on organism.
The organism lives as before, passing the allele to its offspring.
The mutation is beneficial to the organism.
The organism can hunt and survive more efficiently than before.
Individuals with this beneficial allele live longer and reproduce more; they are more "fit" to survive in their environment.
This is the basis of Darwin's "survival of the fittest" philosophy.
Soon more individuals within the population have the beneficial allele.
Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans, and a significant health concern all over the world.
Except for a small community in Italy.
All humans have a gene for a protein called Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), which is part of the system that transports cholesterol through the bloodstream.
Apo-A1 is an high density lipoprotein (HDL).
HDLs are known as "good" cholesterol as they remove cholesterol from artery walls.
A small community in Italy is known to have a mutant version of this protein, named Apolipoprotein A1-Milano (or Apo A1M).
This protein is even more effective at removing cholesterol from cells and dissolving arterial plaques associated with heart disease.
