Explain the relationship between kinetic energy and state of matter.
Changes of State
Define change of state.
Identify processes that cause changes of state.
Explain the role of energy in changes of state.
Both of these photos show the famous Golden Gate Bridge near San Francisco, California.
The pictures were taken from about the same point of view, but they look very different.
In the picture on the left, the deck of the bridge is almost completely hidden by a thick layer of fog.
In the picture on the right the fog has disappeared, and the deck of the bridge—as well as the water below it—is clearly visible.
Fog consists of tiny droplets of liquid water.
The fog in the picture is like a cloud at ground level.
Where did the fog come from, and where did it go?
What Are Changes of State?
The water droplets of fog form from water vapor in the air.
Fog disappears when the water droplets change back to water vapor.
These changes are examples of changes of state.
A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state to another.
Common states of matter on Earth are solid, liquid, and gas.
Matter may change back and forth between any two of these states.
Changes of state are physical changes in matter.
