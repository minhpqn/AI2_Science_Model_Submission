Echinoderms are marine organisms that make up the phylum Echinodermata.
They can be found in the ocean from the equator to the poles.
There are roughly 6000 living species of echinoderms.
They are among the most distinctive organisms within the animal kingdom.
Members of the phylum include sea stars (starfish), sand dollars, and feather stars, shown in Figure below .
See “Different But Equal” at for an introduction to echinoderms.
Examples of echinoderms: sand dollar, sea star, feather star
Examples of Echinoderms.
You may have seen sea stars and sand dollars at the beach because they live in shallow water near the shore.
Other echinoderms, such as feather stars, are less commonly seen because they live in the deep ocean.
Structure and Function of Echinoderms
Echinoderms are named for their “spiny skin.” However, the spines aren’t on their skin.
They are part of the endoskeleton.
The endoskeleton consists of calcium carbonate plates and spines, covered by a thin layer of skin.
Adult echinoderms have radial symmetry .
This is easy to see in the sea star and sand dollar in Figure above .
However, echinoderms evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry.
Evidence for this is the bilateral symmetry of their larvae.
A unique feature of echinoderms is their water vascular system .
This is a network of canals that extend along each body part.
