Define a transcription factor.
Describe common cis-regulatory elements.
What turns a gene on?
Many times it involves a protein binding to DNA.
Shown here is a model of p53 protein bound to DNA. p53 is a transcription factor whose inactivation can trigger the onset of cancer.
Mechanisms of Gene Regulation
Any step of gene expression may be modulated, from the initiation of transcription to the post-translational modification of a protein.
Following is a list of stages where gene expression is regulated:
Chemical and structural modification of DNA or chromatin.
In this concept, we will focus on regulation at the level of transcription.
During transcription, RNA polymerase binds to a gene and reads the DNA template to make a complementary strand of RNA.
How does RNA polymerase know which genes to bind to, when to bind to those genes, and where on the gene to bind?
Concerning the binding of RNA polymerase, the which, when and where is a highly regulated process.
When RNA polymerase binds to a gene, it binds to the promoter , a segment of DNA that allows a gene to be transcribed.
The promoter helps RNA polymerase find the start of a gene.
cis and trans
Gene regulation at the level of transcription controls when transcription occurs as well as how much RNA is created.
This regulation is controlled by cis-regulatory elements ( cis from the Latin word meaning "on the same side as") and trans-acting factors ( trans from the Latin root meaning "across from").
A cis-regulatory element is a region of DNA which regulates the expression of a gene or multiple genes located on that same strand of DNA.
These cis-regulatory elements are often the binding sites of one or more trans-acting factors, usually a regulatory protein which interacts with RNA polymerase.
