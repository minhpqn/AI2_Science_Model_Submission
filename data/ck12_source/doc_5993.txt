Fluorine is the most reactive halogen, while iodine is the least.
Since chlorine is above bromine, it is more reactive than bromine and can replace it in a halogen replacement reaction.
The activity series describes the relative reactivities of metals and halogens.
Read the material at the link below and do the practice problems:
What is a metal replacement reaction?
Will a non-metal replace a metal?
What is the most reactive halogen?
What products will I get if I add potassium metal to water?
single-replacement reaction:
A reaction in which one element replaces a similar element in a compound.
Define activity series.
Use the activity series to predict the outcome of reactions.
Sodium and silver have very different reactivities with water
Whatâ€™s the difference between the two pictures above?
We see above two metals that can be exposed to water.
The picture on the left is of sodium, which gives a violent reaction when it comes in contact with water.
The picture on the right is of silver, a metal so unreactive with water that it can be made into drinking vessels.
Both metals have a single s electron in their outer shell, so you would predict similar reactivities.
However, we have a better tool that allows us to make better prediction about what will react with what.
