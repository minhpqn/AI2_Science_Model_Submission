How Water Recycles
Like other matter on Earth, water is continuously recycled.
Individual water molecules are always going through the water cycle , in which molecules of water cycle through both the living and non-living parts of the biosphere (discussed in the Recycling Matter:
The Water Cycle (Advanced) concept).
In fact, water molecules on Earth have been moving through the water cycle for billions of years.
In this cycle, water evaporates from Earth’s surface (or escapes from the surface in other ways), forms clouds, and falls back to the surface as precipitation.
This cycle keeps repeating.
Several processes change water from one state to another during the water cycle.
They include:
Evaporation —Liquid water on Earth’s surface changes into water vapor in the atmosphere.
Sublimation —Snow or ice on Earth’s surface changes directly into water vapor in the atmosphere.
Transpiration —Plants give off liquid water, most of which evaporates into the atmosphere.
Condensation —Water vapor in the atmosphere changes to liquid water droplets, forming clouds or fog.
Precipitation —Water droplets in clouds are pulled to Earth’s surface by gravity, forming rain, snow, or other type of falling moisture.
Like other biogeochemical cycles, there is no beginning or end to the water cycle.
It just keeps repeating.
condensation :
The process by which water vapor in the atmosphere changes to liquid water droplets, forming clouds or fog.
evaporation :
Liquid water on Earth’s surface changes into water vapor in the atmosphere.
