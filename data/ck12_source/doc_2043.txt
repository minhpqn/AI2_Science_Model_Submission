History of Cenozoic Life
Describe the diversification of life during the Cenozoic.
Do these animals look familiar?
The ice ages were very recent as Earth history goes.
The animals are familiar, but they're still very different from modern ones.
For one thing, most of them were huge.
A small surface area-to-volume ratio is better for keeping warm (less surface to lose heat from).
Although the dominant animals were mammals, the Pleistocene Earth still does not look quite modern.
The Cenozoic Era
The Cenozoic Era is going on right now!
It is the age of mammals.
The Cenozoic began with the extinction of every land creature larger than a dog.
This left many niches open.
Organisms evolved to fill them.
There was a huge radiation of mammals.
But birds, like the few seen in the pictures ( Figure below ), are more common and even more diverse.
Both mammals and birds have the ability to regulate their own body temperature.
They are endotherms (warm blooded).
