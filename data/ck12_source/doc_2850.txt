That’s because a great deal of energy is needed to overcome the force of repulsion between the positively charged nuclei.
The sun’s energy comes from fusion in its core, shown in the Figure below .
In the core, temperatures reach millions of degrees Kelvin.
The video at the following URL relates nuclear fusion to energy and high temperatures in the sun.

Q :
Why doesn’t nuclear fusion occur naturally on Earth?
A :
Nuclear fusion doesn’t occur naturally on Earth because it requires temperatures far higher than Earth temperatures.
Using Nuclear Fusion
Scientists are searching for ways to create controlled nuclear fusion reactions on Earth.
Their goal is develop nuclear fusion power plants, where the energy from fusion of hydrogen nuclei can be converted to electricity.
You can see how this might work in the Figure below .
In the thermonuclear reactor, radiation from fusion is used to heat water and produce steam.
The steam can then be used to turn a turbine and generate electricity.

The use of nuclear fusion for energy has several pros.
Unlike nuclear fission, which involves dangerous radioactive elements, nuclear fusion involves just hydrogen and helium.
These elements are harmless.
