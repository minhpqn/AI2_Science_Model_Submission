The pH will change as a result of many factors.
Adjustment can be accomplished with different chemicals depending on the tested pH.
High pH can be lowered with liquid HCl (unsafe material) or sodium bisulfate.
The bisulfate anion is a weak acid and can dissociate partially in solution.
To increase pH, use sodium carbonate.
The carbonate anion forms an equilibrium with protons that results in some formation of carbon dioxide.
Calculating pH of Salt Solutions
It is often helpful to be able to predict the effect a salt solution will have on the pH of a certain solution.
Knowledge of the relevant acidity or basicity constants allows us to carry out the necessary calculations.
Sample Problem:
Salt Hydrolysis
If we dissolve NaF in water, we get the following equilibrium:
\text{F}^-(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{HF}(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq)
The pH of the resulting solution can be determined if the  K_b of the fluoride ion is known.
20.0 g of sodium fluoride is dissolve in enough water to make 500.0 mL of solution.
Calculate the pH of the solution.
The  K_b of the fluoride ion is 1.4 × 10 −11 .
Step 1:
List the known values and plan the problem.
mass NaF = 20.0 g
