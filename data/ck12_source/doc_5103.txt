What are the most numerous organisms on the planet?
The single-celled prokaryotic organism otherwise known as bacteria.
And all it takes is one to quickly grow, under just the right conditions, into millions and billions.
Luckily, we know how to control bacteria when necessary.
But bacteria do serve many important purposes.
In fact, we could not survive without them.
Describe common bacterial shapes.
Summarize the similarities between bacterial cells and eukaryotic cells.
Summarize the differences between bacterial cells and eukaryotic cells.
Explain the roles of the cell wall and the flagella in bacteria.
Are bacteria living things?
Bacteria are individual living cells.
Bacteria cells are similar to your cells in many ways; yet, they also have distinct differences.
Bacteria have many unique adaptations allowing them to live in many different environments.
Characteristics of Bacteria
Bacteria are the most successful organisms on the planet.
They lived on this planet for two billion years before the first eukaryotes and, during that time, evolved into millions of different species.
Size and Shape
Bacteria are so small that they can only be seen with a microscope.
When viewed under the microscope, they have three distinct shapes ( Figure below ).
