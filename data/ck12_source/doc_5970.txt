What is the difference between an empirical formula and a molecular formula?
In addition to the elemental analysis, what do you need to know to calculate the molecular formula?
What does the empirical formula mass tell you?
empirical formula mass (EFM):
The molar mass represented by the empirical formula.
molecular formula:
Gives the kind and number of atoms of each element present in a molecular compound.
