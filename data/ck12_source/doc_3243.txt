Slap!
Did you ever hear this slogan?
It stands for slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen, and slap on a hat.
The slogan originated in Australia in the 1980s, but it has since been adopted in many other places around the globe.
It sums up simple steps you can take to protect your skin from sunlight.
Sunlight consists of a wide range of electromagnetic waves, some of which are harmful.
The Waves in Sunlight
Electromagnetic waves are waves that carry energy through matter or space as vibrating electric and magnetic fields.
Electromagnetic waves have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies.
Sunlight contains the complete range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves, which is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
The Figure below shows all the waves in the spectrum.
Infrared, ultraviolet, and visible light fall in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum
Let There Be Light
Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light.
As you can see from the Figure above , light falls roughly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum.
It has shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than microwaves, but not as short and high as X rays.
Q:
Which type of light do you think is harmful to the skin?
A:
Waves of light with the highest frequencies have the most energy and are harmful to the skin.
