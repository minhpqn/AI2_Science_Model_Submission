Sponge life cycle
The sponge life cycle includes sexual reproduction.
Sponges may also reproduce asexually.
Sperm are released into the surrounding water through the osculum.
If they enter a female sponge through a pore, they may be trapped by collar cells.
Trapped sperm are delivered to eggs inside the female body, where fertilization takes place.
The resulting zygote develops into a larva.
Unlike the adult, the larva is motile.
It is covered with cilia that propel it through the water.
As the larva grows, it becomes more similar to an adult sponge and loses its ability to swim.
Ecology of Sponges
Sponges that live on coral reefs have symbiotic relationships with other reef species.
They provide shelter for algae, shrimp, and crabs.
In return, they get nutrients from the metabolism of the organisms they shelter.
Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish.
Because sponges are sessile, they cannot flee from predators.
Their sharp spicules provide some defense.
They also produce toxins that may poison predators that try to eat them.
Sponges are aquatic invertebrates.
They make up the phylum Porifera.
