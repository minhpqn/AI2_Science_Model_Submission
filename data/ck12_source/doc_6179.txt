Think about your result.
The answer represents the moles of glucose per kilogram of water and has three significant figures.
Molality and molarity are closely related in value for dilute aqueous solutions because the density of those solutions is relatively close to 1.0 g/mL.
This means that 1.0 L of solution has nearly a mass of 1.0 kg.
As the solution becomes more concentrated, its density will not be as close to 1.0 g/ml and the molality value will be different than the molarity.
For solutions with solvents other than water, the molality will be very different than the molarity.
Make sure that you are paying attention to which quantity is being used in a given problem.
The calculation of molality is described.
Read the material at the link below and do the practice problems:
What is the difference between molarity and molality?
Is molality affected by changes in temperature?
Do you dilute the solute to a given final volume when making molal solutions?
molality ( m) :
Moles of solute divided by the kilograms of solvent.
Vapor Pressure Lowering
Define colligative property.
Define vapor pressure.
Use vapor pressure to explain colligative properties of solutions.
The word &squot;colligative&squot; comes from two Latin words meaning "to tie together"
