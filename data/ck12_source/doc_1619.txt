Red blood cells can be kept from bursting or shriveling if put in a solution that is isotonic to the blood cells.
If the blood cells were put in pure water, the solution would be hypotonic to the blood cells, so water would enter the blood cells, and they would swell and burst ( Figure below ).
Drawing of blood cells in a hypertonic, isotonic, or hypotonic environment
Osmosis causes these red blood cells to change shape by losing or gaining water.
Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
The diffusion of water across a membrane because of a difference in concentration is called osmosis.
