Do not share food and other things that go in the mouth, as in guzzling milk from the carton or double dipping chips.
You never know what pathogens can be lurking around.
Cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and to dispose of the tissue yourself.
No time to grab a tissue.
Cough or sneeze into the inside of your elbow instead of your hands.
Visit Your Doctor
Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as whooping cough and flu.
In fact, a yearly flu vaccine is recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months of age.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu.
People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, pregnant women, and people younger than 5 years (and especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should also make sure they get the yearly flu vaccine.
Seeking medical help for diseases like asthma can help stop the disease from getting worse.
