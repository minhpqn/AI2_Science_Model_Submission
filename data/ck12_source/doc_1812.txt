Humus forms from the remains of plants and animals.
It is an extremely important part of the soil.
Humus coats the mineral grains.
It binds them together into clumps that hold the soil together.
This gives the soil its structure.
Soils with high humus are better able to hold water.
Soils rich with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more fertile.
These soils are more easily farmed.
The color of soil indicates its fertility.
Black or dark brown soils are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials.
Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray, yellow, or red ( Figure below ).
Soil with low organic material is not good for growing plants.
An area with sandy soil and low fertility
This sandy soil shows evidence of very little organic activity.
Plants grow, but are far apart and short-lived.
This means that little soil can form.
The soil that's there has little organic content.
An animation of how different types of weathering affect different minerals in soil:
Many factors affect soil formation.
Some are climate, rock type, slope, time, and biological activity.
