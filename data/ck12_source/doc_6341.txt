You can automatically deposit paychecks, pay bills, and designate how much goes into savings or other special accounts each month.
If you want to maintain 10% of your bank account in savings, you can set up a program that moves money in and out of the account when you get a paycheck or pay bills.
The amount of money in savings will change as the money comes in and out of the bank, but the ratio of savings to checking will always be constant.
LeChâtelier’s Principle and the Equilibrium Constant
Occasionally, when students apply LeChatelier’s principle to an equilibrium problem involving a change in concentration, they assume that K_{eq} must change.
This seems logical since we talk about “shifting” the equilibrium in one direction or the other.
However, K_{eq} is a constant, for a given equilibrium at a given temperature, so it must not change.
Here is an example of how this works.
Consider the simplified equilibrium below:
A \rightleftarrows B
Let’s say we have a 1.0 liter container.
At equilibrium the following amounts are measured.
A &=0.50 \text{ mol} \\B &=1.0 \text{ mol}
The value of  K_{eq} is given by:
K_{eq}= \frac{\left [B \right ]}{\left [A \right ]}=\frac{1.0 \text{ M}}{0.50 \text{ M}}=2.0
Now we will disturb the equilibrium by adding 0.50 mole of  A to the mixture.
The equilibrium will shift towards the right, forming more B .
Immediately after the addition of  A and before any response, we now have 1.0 mol of  A and 1.0 mol of B .
The equilibrium then shifts in the forward direction.
We will introduce a variable (x) , which will represent the change in concentrations as the reaction proceeds.
