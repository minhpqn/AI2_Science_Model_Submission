The first stage transforms light energy into chemical energy, stored to this point in molecules of ATP and NADPH.
Look again at the overall equation below.
What is left?
Waiting in the atmosphere is one more reactant, carbon dioxide, and yet to come is the product which is food for all life – glucose.
These key players perform in the second stage of the photosynthesis, in which food is “made from thin air.” The second stage of photosynthesis can proceed without light, so its steps are sometimes called “light-independent” or “dark” reactions.
Many biologists honor the scientist, Melvin Calvin, who won a 1961 Nobel Prize for working out this complex set of chemical reactions, naming it the Calvin Cycle .
The Calvin Cycle has two parts.
First carbon dioxide is "fixed." Then ATP and NADPH from the Light Reactions provide energy to combine the fixed carbons to make sugar.

Carbon Dioxide is “Fixed”
Why does carbon dioxide need to be fixed?
Was it ever broken?
Life on Earth is carbon-based.
Organisms need not only energy but also carbon atoms for building bodies.
For nearly all life, the ultimate source of carbon is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), an inorganic molecule pulled into the producer from the atmosphere.
CO 2 , as you saw in Figure below , makes up .038% of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Animals and most other heterotrophs cannot take in CO 2 directly.
They must eat other organisms or absorb organic molecules to get carbon.
Only autotrophs can build low-energy inorganic CO 2 into high-energy organic molecules like glucose.
