Assigning Oxidation Numbers
List the rules for determining oxidation numbers.
Use these rules to determine oxidation number in materials.
Traces of iron oxide make these rocks red
Once we move from the element iron to iron compounds, we need to be able to designate clearly the form of the iron ion.  An example of this is iron that has been oxidized to form iron oxide during the process of rusting.
Although Antoine Lavoisier first began the idea off oxidation as a concept, it was Wendell Latimer (1893-1955) who gave us the modern concept of oxidation numbers.
His 1938 book The Oxidation States of the Elements and Their Potentials in Aqueous Solution laid out the concept in detail.
Latimer was a well-known chemist who later became a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
Not bad for a gentleman who started college planning on being a lawyer.
Assigning Oxidation Numbers
The oxidation number is a positive or negative number that is assigned to an atom to indicate its degree of oxidation or reduction.
In oxidation-reduction processes, the driving force for chemical change is in the exchange of electrons between chemical species.
A series of rules have been developed to help us:
For free elements (uncombined state), each atom has an oxidation number of zero.
