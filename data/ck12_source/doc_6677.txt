Do you care about the distance the scissors have traveled or their displacement?
Explain your answer.
You’re trying to predict how long it’s going to take to get to Los Angeles for the long weekend.
Do you care about the distance you’ll travel or your displacement?
Explain your answer.

No, displacement is 'as the crow flies' so to speak, while distance takes into account the curves and turns that the fox takes.
Explain the meaning of speed, velocity and average velocity.
Students will learn the meaning of speed, velocity and average velocity.
Speed = distance/time
v_{avg} & = \frac{\boldsymbol{\Delta} x}{\Delta t} \\
Guidance Speed is the distance traveled divided by the time it took to travel that distance.
Velocity is the instantaneous speed and direction.
Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time.
Pacific loggerhead sea turtles migrate over 7,500 miles (12,000 km) between nesting beaches in Japan and feeding grounds off the coast of Mexico.
If the average speed of a loggerhead is about 45 km/day, how long does it take for it to complete the distance of a one-way migration?
Question: t = ? [days]
Given: d = 12,000 \ km
{\;} \qquad v_{avg} = 45 \ km/day
Equation: v_{avg} = \frac{d}{t} therefore t = \frac{d}{v_{avg}}
