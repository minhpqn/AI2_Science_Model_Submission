Speaking of helping things go fast brings us to enzymes.
Life could not exist without enzymes.
Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions.
Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions
Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell.
For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes.
Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide.
Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst.
A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions.
In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes .
Like other catalysts, enzymes are not reactants in the reactions they control.
They help the reactants interact but are not used up in the reactions.
Instead, they may be used over and over again.
Unlike other catalysts, enzymes are usually highly specific for a particular chemical reaction.
They generally catalyze only one or a few types of reactions.
Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up biochemical reactions.
They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second.
As a result, the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous.
A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme, but less than a second with the enzyme.
