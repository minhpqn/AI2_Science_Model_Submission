The answer must be rounded to three significant figures.
Therefore, the decimal must be written in to show that the two ending zeros are significant.
If the decimal is omitted (left as an understood decimal), the two zeros will not be significant and the answer will be wrong.
Example: (5.444 \ \text{cm})(22 \ \text{cm}) = 119.768 \ \text{cm}^2 = 120 \ \text{cm}^2
In this case, the answer must be rounded back to two significant figures.
We cannot have a decimal after the zero in 120 cm 2 because that would indicate the zero is significant, whereas this answer must have exactly two significant figures.
Mathematics is a major tool for doing physics.
The very large and very small measurements in physics make it useful to express numbers in scientific notation.
There is uncertainty in all measurements.
The use of significant figures is one way to keep track of uncertainty.
Measurements must be written with the proper number of significant figures and the results of calculations must show the proper number of significant figures.
Rules for Determining the Number of Significant Figures:
All non-zero digits are significant.
All zeros between non-zero digits are significant.
All beginning zeros are not significant.
Ending zeros are significant if the decimal point is actually written in but not significant if the decimal point is an understood decimal (the decimal point is not written in).
