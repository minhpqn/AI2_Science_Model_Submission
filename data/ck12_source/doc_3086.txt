Look at the wheelbarrow in the Figure below .
It is used to carry heavy objects.
It consists of two simple machines: a lever and a wheel and axle.
Effort is applied to the lever by picking up the handles of the wheelbarrow.
The lever, in turn, applies upward force to the load.
The force is increased by the lever, making the load easier to lift.
Effort is applied to the wheel of the wheelbarrow by pushing it over the ground.
The rolling wheel turns the axle and increases the force, making it easier to push the load.

The corkscrew in the Figure below is also a compound machine.
It is used to pierce a cork and pull it out of the neck of a bottle.
It consists of a screw and two levers.
Turning the handle on top twists the screw down into the center of the cork.
Then, pushing down on the two levers causes the screw to pull upward, bringing the cork with it.
The levers increase the force and change its direction.

Efficiency of Compound Machines
Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching.
All machines have moving parts and friction, so they have to use some of the work that is applied to them to overcome friction.
