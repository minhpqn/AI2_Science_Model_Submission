The space outside the plasma membrane of plant cells; formed by the continuum of cell walls of adjacent cells.
cell wall :
Rigid layer that surrounds the plasma membrane of prokaryotic cells and plant cells; helps support and protect the cell.
central vacuole :
Large saclike organelle in plant cells; stores substances such as water; helps keep plant tissues rigid.
chloroplast :
The organelle of photosynthesis; site of photosynthesis.
chromoplast :
Plastid responsible for pigment synthesis and storage in specific photosynthetic eukaryotes.
cytoplasmic sleeve :
A fluid-filled space enclosed by the plasmalemma and a continuous extension of the cytosol.
grana (singular: granum ):
Structure within the chloroplast; consists of stacks of sac-like thylakoid membranes.
leucoplast :
Non-pigmented plastid specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid or protein; located in roots and non-photosynthetic tissues of plants.
photosynthesis :
The process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose and oxygen, using sunlight for energy.
plasmodesmata (singular, plasmodesma ):
Microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells; enables transport and communication between them.
plastid :
