The diagram also shows the maximum possible number of electrons at each energy level.
Electrons at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus, have less energy.
At the lowest energy level, which has the least energy, there is just one orbital, so this energy level has a maximum of two electrons.
Only when a lower energy level is full are electrons added to the next higher energy level.
Electrons at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus, have more energy.
They also have more orbitals and greater possible numbers of electrons.
Electrons at the outermost energy level of an atom are called valence electrons.
They determine many of the properties of an element.
Thatâ€™s because these electrons are involved in chemical reactions with other atoms.
Atoms may share or transfer valence electrons.
Shared electrons bind atoms together to form chemical compounds.

Energy levels and electrons
Q:
If an atom has 12 electrons, how will they be distributed in energy levels?
A:
The atom will have two electrons at the first energy level, eight at the second energy level, and the remaining two at the third energy level.
Q:
Sometimes, an electron jumps from one energy level to another.
How do you think this happens?
