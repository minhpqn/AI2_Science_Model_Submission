When a satellite, space shuttle, or some other object is orbiting a planet, it maintains a circular orbit around the planet a constant distance off the surface.
Manmade satellites typically orbit between 200 and 400 miles.
For example, the International Space Station (ISS) orbits at 370 km, or 230 miles.
The ISS has an average velocity of 7.66 km/sec tangential to its orbit.
An orbiting satellite is close enough to be acted upon by Earth’s gravity.
This force is constantly pulling the satellite in toward the center of the earth – it is a centripetal force and causes a centripetal acceleration.
At this height, however, Earth’s gravity is only about 8.7 m/s 2 .
As was discussed in Motion in Two Dimensions:
Circular Motion, the velocity and centripetal acceleration are perpendicular.
NASA scientists, in designing this and all other satellites, must carefully calculate the velocity necessary to keep the satellite orbiting.
To keep the satellite from falling back to Earth, the horizontal velocity must be large enough.
The satellite must travel far enough horizontally that it follows the curve of the planet, as shown below.
When the satellite is orbiting in this way, it is falling straight down towards Earth.
Imagine standing in an elevator when the bottom drops out from under you.
The elevator, you, and anything you might have had with you all fall straight down.
If you had a backpack on your back, the weight of the books can no longer be felt because the books are in free fall as well.
A similar thing is happening in the space shuttle or orbiting satellite, where objects are weightless.
For a full description of weight, look at Forces:
Mass versus Weight.
In sum, weight is the result of the force of gravity being opposed by the normal force.  As we just learned, objects in orbit are in freefall; they have nothing exerting a normal force against them and thus no weight.
