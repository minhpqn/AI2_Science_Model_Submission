So how does a scientist work with DNA?
It usually starts with the sequence of As, Cs, Gs and Ts.
Once the sequence is known, so much more can be done.
Specific regions can be isolated, cloned, amplified, and analyzed.
In fact, the ability to amplify a specific region of DNA has revolutionized biological research.
And all of this is done to directly or indirectly help us.
Is it really possible to clone people?
Another question is, should we clone people?
Are scientific fantasies, such as depicted on TV shows such as Star Trek or in the movie GATTACA , actually a possibility?
Who can really say?
How, really, will science affect our future?
The answers partially lie in the field of biotechnology.
Biotechnology is technology based on biological applications.
These applications are increasingly used in medicine, agriculture and food science.
Biotechnology combines many features of biology, including genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, embryology, and cell biology.
Many aspects of biotechnology center around DNA and its applications, otherwise known as DNA technology.
We could devote a whole textbook to current applications of biotechnology, however, we will focus on the applications towards medicine and agriculture, and the extension into the forensic sciences.
First, though, we need to understand DNA technology.
What is DNA technology?
Is it using and manipulating DNA to help people?
