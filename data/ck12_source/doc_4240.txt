Learned Behavior of Animals
Define learning and insight learning.
State ways that animals learn.
Give examples of learned behaviors.
Fighting or playing?
You might think that these young tigers are fighting, but theyâ€™re really just playing.
Like most other young mammals, tigers like to play.
Why do mammals play?
Is playing just for fun, or does it serve some other purpose as well?
Playing is actually an important way of learning.
By playing, these tigers are learning moves that will help them become successful predators as adults.
Playing is just one of many ways that mammals and other animals learn how to behave.
Learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience.
Compared with innate behaviors, learned behaviors are more flexible.
They can be modified to suit changing conditions.
This may make them more adaptive than innate behaviors.
For example, drivers may have to modify how they drive (a learned behavior) when roads are wet or icy.
