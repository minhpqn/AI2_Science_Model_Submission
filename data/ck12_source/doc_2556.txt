Schrödinger’s work on orbitals is the basis of the modern model of the atom, which scientists call the quantum mechanical model.
The modern model is also commonly called the electron cloud model.
That’s because each orbital around the nucleus of the atom resembles a fuzzy cloud around the nucleus, like the ones shown in the Figure below for a helium atom.
The densest area of the cloud is where the electrons have the greatest chances of being.
Schrodinger's model of the atom
Q:
In the model pictured in the Figure above , where are the two helium electrons most likely to be?
A:
The two electrons are most likely to be inside the sphere closest to the nucleus where the cloud is darkest.
Bohr’s model of the atom, in which electrons circle the nucleus at fixed energy levels, cannot explain all the behaviors of electrons.
In the 1920s, Erwin Schrödinger proposed that electrons travel in waves, which means their exact positions cannot be determined.
He developed an equation to calculate the chances of an electron being in any given place.
Using his equation, he identified regions around the nucleus, called orbitals, where electrons are most likely to be.
Orbitals are the basis of the electron cloud model of the atom.
This model is still accepted by scientists today.
