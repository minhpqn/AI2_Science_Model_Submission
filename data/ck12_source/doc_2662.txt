The other atom attracts the shared electrons less strongly, so it is has a partial positive charge.
In a water molecule, the oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do.
This explains why the oxygen side of the water molecule has a partial negative charge and the hydrogen side of the molecule has a partial positive charge.
Q:
If a molecule is polar, how might this affect its interactions with nearby molecules of the same compound?
A:
Opposite charges on different molecules of the same compound might cause the molecules to be attracted to each other.
Because of water’s polarity, individual water molecules are attracted to one another.
You can see this in the Figure below .
The positively charged hydrogen side of one water molecule is attracted to the negatively charged oxygen side of a nearby water molecule.
This force of attraction is called a hydrogen bond .

Hydrogen bonds between polar water molecules
Hydrogen bonds are intermolecular (“between-molecule”) bonds, rather than intramolecular (“within-molecule”) bonds.
They occur not only in water but in other polar molecules in which positive hydrogen atoms are attracted to negative atoms in nearby molecules.
Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak as chemical bonds go.
For example, they are much weaker than the bonds holding atoms together within molecules of covalent compounds.
