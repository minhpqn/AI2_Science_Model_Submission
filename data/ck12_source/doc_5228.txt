So what would be done if it was necessary to know the genotype?
A testcross can be used to determine the organism's genotype.
In a testcross, the individual with the unknown genotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive individual ( Figure below ).
Consider the following example:
Suppose you have a purple and white flower and purple color ( P ) is dominant to white ( p ).
The white flower must be homozygous for the recessive allele, but the genotype of the purple flower is unknown.
It could be either PP or Pp .
A testcross will determine the organism's genotype.
The unknown genotype can be determined by observing the phenotypes of the resulting offspring.
If crossing the unknown dominant phenotype ( PP or Pp genotype) individual with the recessive phenotype individual produces only dominant phenotypes (no recessive), then the unknown individual is homozygous dominant.
If any recessive phenotypic individuals result from the cross, then the unknown individual must carry the recessive allele, and have the heterozygous genotype.
In the example shown here, a testcross is done to determine the genotype of a parental Agouti rat.
Agouti ( A ) refers to a pattern of pigmentation in which individual hairs have several bands of light and dark pigment with black tips, and is the common color of the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus .
Agouti is the dominant phenotype, and in this example, has the genotypes AA or Aa.
White fur color is the recessive phenotype, with a aa genotype.
If rats with white fur result from the parental cross, then both parents must carry the recessive allele, and the unknown parent must have an Aa genotype.
A testcross helps reveal the genotype of an organism when that organism shows the dominant trait, such as agouti coat color in rats.
Such an organism could be homozygous dominant or heterozygous.
Determining Missing Genotypes
A Punnett square can also be used to determine a missing genotype based on the other genotypes involved in a cross.
