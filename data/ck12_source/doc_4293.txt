Common and Familiar mollusks: snail, scallop, squid
This figure shows some of the more common and familiar mollusks.
Structure and Function of Mollusks
Mollusks are a very diverse phylum.
Some mollusks are nearly microscopic.
The largest mollusk, a colossal squid, may be as long as a school bus and weigh over half a ton!
The basic body plan of a mollusk is shown in Figure below .
The main distinguishing feature is a hard outer shell.
It covers the top of the body and encloses the internal organs.
Most mollusks have a distinct head region.
The head may have tentacles for sensing the environment and grasping food.
There is generally a muscular foot, which may be used for walking.
However, the foot has evolved modifications in many species to be used for other purposes.

Basic Mollusk Body Plan.
The basic body plan shown here varies among mollusk classes.
For example, several mollusk species no longer have shells.
Do you know which ones?
Two unique features of mollusks are the mantle and radula (see Figure above ).
