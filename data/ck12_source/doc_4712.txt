A hypothesis cannot be proven conclusively to be true.
This is because you can never examine all of the possible evidence, and someday evidence might be found that disproves the hypothesis.
Nonetheless, the more evidence that supports a hypothesis, the more likely the hypothesis is to be true.
The last step in a scientific investigation is communicating what you have learned with others.
This is a very important step because it allows others to test your hypothesis.
If other researchers get the same results as yours, they add support to the hypothesis.
However, if they get different results, they may disprove the hypothesis.
When scientists share their results, they should describe their methods and point out any possible problems with the investigation.
Results can be communicated in various ways.
A scientist usually contributes material through publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
Peer-review ensures the material is of an acceptable quality for the scientific community.
Scientists also write review articles, book chapters, and even whole books.
They also regularly participate in scientific meetings, presenting their material in front of large audiences of their peers.
accuracy :
The measure of how close a calculated or measured quantity is to its actual value.
control :
Something that is not tested during the investigation.
controlled experiment :
Two identical experiments are carried out side-by-side; in one of the experiments the independent variable being tested is used, in the other experiment, the control, or the independent variable is not used.
controlled variables :
