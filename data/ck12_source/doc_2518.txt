For example, all helium atoms have two protons, and no other elements have atoms with two protons.
In the case of helium, the atomic number is 2.
The atomic number of an element is usually written in front of and slightly below the element’s symbol, like in the Figure below for helium.
Atomic and mass number of helium
Atoms are neutral in electrical charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons.
Therefore, the atomic number of an atom also tells you how many electrons the atom has.
This, in turn, determines many of the atom’s properties.
There is another number in the Figure above for helium.
That number is the mass number , which is the mass of the atom in a unit called the atomic mass unit (amu) .
One atomic mass unit is the mass of a proton, or about 1.67 × 10 -27 kilograms, which is an extremely small mass.
To better appreciate how small an atomic mass unit is, go to this URL:
A neutron has just a tiny bit more mass than a proton, so its mass is often assumed to be one atomic mass unit as well.
Because electrons have virtually no mass, just about all the mass of an atom is in its protons and neutrons.
Therefore, the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom determines its mass in atomic mass units.
Consider helium again.
Most helium atoms have two neutrons in addition to two protons.
Therefore the mass of most helium atoms is 4 atomic mass units (2 amu for the protons + 2 amu for the neutrons).
However, some helium atoms have more or less than two neutrons.
Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Because the number of neutrons can vary for a given element, the mass numbers of different atoms of an element may also vary.
