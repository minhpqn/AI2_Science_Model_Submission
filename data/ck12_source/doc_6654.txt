Mating Behavior and Defending Territory
Some of the most important animal behaviors involve mating.
Mating is the pairing of an adult male and female to produce young.
Adults that are most successful at attracting a mate are most likely to have offspring.
Traits that help animals attract a mate and have offspring increase their fitness.
As the genes that encode these traits are passed to the next generation, the traits will become more common in the population.
In many species, females choose the male they will mate with.
