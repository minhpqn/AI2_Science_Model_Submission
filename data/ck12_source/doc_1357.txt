What happens where there is plate convergence?
How is carbon dioxide released from the rock?
How is carbon dioxide returned to the atmosphere?
What are the two sources of melting at convergent plate boundaries?
Why are there so many volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean basin?
What causes melting at divergent plate boundaries?
Volcanoes at Hotspots
Describe hotspots and the volcanic activity they create.
What does an intraplate eruption look like?
The Hawaiian Islands are formed from a hotspot beneath the Pacific Ocean.
Volcanoes grow above the hotspot.
Lava flows down the hillsides, and some of it reaches the ocean, causing the islands to grow.
Too hot now, but a great place in the future for beach lovers!
Some volcanoes form over active hotspots .
Scientists count about 50 hotspots on the Earth.
Hotspots lie directly above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume .
Mantle plumes continuously bring hot rock up from the mantle toward the crust ( Figure below ).
The rock melts due to the release of pressure.
Map of mantle plumes around the world
Mantle plumes are found all over the world, especially in the ocean basins.
