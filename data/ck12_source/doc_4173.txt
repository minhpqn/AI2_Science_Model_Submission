There are three basic types of cells in most plants.
These cells make up ground tissue, which will be discussed in another concept.
The three types of cells are described in Table below .
The different types of plant cells have different structures and functions.
See Vascular Plant Tissues at for additional information.

Plants have eukaryotic cells with large central vacuoles, cell walls containing cellulose, and plastids such as chloroplasts and chromoplasts.
Different types of plant cells include parenchymal, collenchymal, and sclerenchymal cells.
The three types differ in structure and function.
