Calculating Standard Heat of Reaction
Calculate the standard heat of reaction  (\Delta H^\circ) for the reaction of nitrogen monoxide gas with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide gas.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem .
\Delta H{_f}^\circ \ \text{for NO}(\text{g})=90.4 \text{ kJ/mol}
\Delta H{_f}^\circ \ \text{for O}_2 (\text{g})=0 \ (\text{element})
\Delta H{_f}^\circ \ \text{for NO}_2(\text{g})=33.85 \text{ kJ/mol}
\Delta H^\circ=? \text{ kJ}
First write the balanced equation for the reaction.
Then apply the equation to calculate the standard heat of reaction for the standard heats of formation.
Step 2:
Solve .
The balanced equation is: 2\text{NO(g)}+\text{O}_2(\text{g}) \rightarrow 2\text{NO}_2(\text{g})
Applying the equation form the text:
\Delta H^\circ&=[2 \text{ mol NO}_2 (33.85 \text{ kJ/mol})] - [2 \text{ mol NO}(90.4 \text{ kJ/mol}) + 1 \text{ mol O}_2 (0 \text{ kJ/mol})] \\&=-113 \text{ kJ}
The standard heat of reaction is -113 kJ.
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The reaction is exothermic, which makes sense because it is a combustion reaction and combustion reactions always release heat.
Standard heats of reaction can be calculated from standard heats of formation.
