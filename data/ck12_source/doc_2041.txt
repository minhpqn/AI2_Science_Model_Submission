These features are more typical of endotherms.
An interesting look at the points for dinosaur endothermy is seen here:  .
Skeleton of a plesiosaur, a swimming dinosaur
Plesiosaurs were swimming dinosaurs.
Plants also did well in the Mesozoic.
Lush forests covered the land.
Flowering plants evolved later in the Mesozoic.
Rise of the Mammals
Mammals appeared near the end of the Triassic.
The most famous mass extinction was 65 million years ago.
Between the Mesozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era, about 50% of all animal species died off.
This mass extinction is when the dinosaurs became extinct.
Most scientists think that the extinction was caused by a giant meteorite that struck Earth.
The impact heated the atmosphere until it became as hot as a kitchen oven.
Animals roasted.
Dust flew into the atmosphere and blocked sunlight for a year or more.
This caused a deep freeze and ended photosynthesis.
Sulfur from the impact mixed with water in the atmosphere.
The result was acid rain.
The rain dissolved the shells of the tiny marine plankton that form the base of the food chain.
