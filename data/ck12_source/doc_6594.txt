Marathon runners running together
Are we there yet?
As the weather warms up, the runners come out.
Not just the casual joggers, but those really serious ones who actually enjoy running all 26.2 miles of a marathon.
Prior to these races (and a lot of shorter ones), you hear a lot about carbo-loading.
This practice involves eating a lot of starch in the days prior to the race.
The starch is converted to glucose, which is normally used for biochemical energy.
Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in liver and muscle tissue to be used when needed.
If there is a lot of glycogen available, the muscles will have more biochemical energy to draw on when needed for the long run.
The rest of us will just sit at the sidewalk restaurant eating our spaghetti and enjoying watching other people work hard.
Many simple sugars can combine by repeated condensation reactions until a very large molecule is formed.
