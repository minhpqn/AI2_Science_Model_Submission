Contractile vacuoles are found in certain protists.
These vacuoles take water from the cytoplasm and excrete it from the cell to avoid bursting due to osmotic pressure.
clathrin :
A protein that plays a major role in the formation of coated vesicles.
contractile vacuole :
An organelle found in freshwater protists involved in osmoregulation; pumps excess water out of a cell.
endocytosis :
The cellular process of capturing a material/substance from outside the cell by vesicle formation.
exocytosis :
The cellular process of secreting materials by vesicle fusion.
hormone :
A chemical messenger molecule.
lysosome :
A vesicle that contains powerful digestive enzymes.
neurotransmitter :
Chemical messages which are released at the synapse; relay the message/signal onto the next neuron or other type of cell.
peroxisome :
Vesicles that use oxygen to break down toxic substances in the cell.
porosome :
A cup-shaped structure in the cell membranes of eukaryotic cells where vesicles dock in the process of vesicle fusion and secretion.
