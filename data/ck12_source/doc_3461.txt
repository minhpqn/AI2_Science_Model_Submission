In glutamic acid, in contrast, the side chain is CH 2 CH 2 COOH.
Variable side chains give amino acids different chemical properties.
The order of amino acids, together with the properties of the amino acids, determines the shape of the protein, and the shape of the protein determines the function of the protein.
KEY:
H = hydrogen, N = nitrogen, C = carbon, O = oxygen, R = variable side chain
When amino acids bind together, they form a long chain called a polypeptide .
A protein consists of one or more polypeptide chains.
A protein may have up to four levels of structure.
The lowest level, a proteinâ€™s primary structure, is its sequence of amino acids.
Higher levels of protein structure are described in Figure below .
The complex structures of different proteins give them unique properties, which they need to carry out their various jobs in living organisms.

Protein Structure.
The structure of a protein starts with its sequence of amino acids.
What determines the secondary structure of a protein?
What are two types of secondary protein structure?
Functions of Proteins
Proteins play many important roles in living things.
Some proteins help cells keep their shape (structural proteins), some, such as connective and motor proteins, make up muscle tissues, and some transport items in and out of cells (transport proteins).
