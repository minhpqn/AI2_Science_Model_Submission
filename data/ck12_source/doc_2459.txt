In order for solid chocolate to melt and change to a liquid, the particles of chocolate must gain energy.
The chocolate pictured in the Figure above gained energy from sunlight.
Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter, and it is always involved in changes of state.
When matter changes from one state to another, it either absorbs energy—as when chocolate melts—or loses energy.
For example, if you were to place the melted chocolate in a refrigerator, it would lose energy to the cold air inside the refrigerator.
As a result, the liquid chocolate would change to a solid again.
Q:
Why is energy always involved in changes of state?
A:
The energy of particles of matter determines the matter's state.
Particles of a gas have more energy than particles of a liquid, and particles of a liquid have more energy than particles of a solid.
Therefore, in order for matter to change from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas, particles of matter must absorb energy.
In order for matter to change from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, particles of matter must lose energy.
A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state to another.
Changes of state are physical changes in matter.
They are reversible changes that do not change matter’s chemical makeup or chemical properties.
Processes involved in changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and evaporation.
Energy is always involved in changes of state.
Particles of matter either absorb or lose energy when matter changes from one state to another.
