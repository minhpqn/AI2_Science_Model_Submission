Diagram of Chinnok winds
As air rises over a mountain it cools and loses moisture.
The air warms by compression on the leeward side.
The resulting warm and dry winds are Chinook winds.
The leeward side of the mountain experiences rainshadow effect.
Santa Ana Winds
Santa Ana winds ( Figure below ) are responsible for many large fires in Southern California ( Figure below ).
The Santa Ana winds arrive at the end of Californiaâ€™s long summer drought season.
Air east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains cools in late fall.
This creates a high pressure zone.
The air is then forced downhill through the deserts of the Southwest.
It blows westward toward the ocean.
The air is blocked by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains.
So it is funneled rapidly through the mountain passes.
If a fire starts, it spreads quickly.
The result is large-scale devastation.

The winds are especially fast through Santa Ana Canyon, for which they are named.
Santa Ana winds blow dust and smoke westward over the Pacific from Southern California.
