Of course!
This photo of a partial solar eclipse was taken on May 20, 2012 in Gilbert, Arizona.
The maximum was 82% at that location.
Further north people experienced totality.
The next two eclipses in North America will be a partial on October 23, 2014 and a total on August 21, 2017.
If you try to view an eclipse, be sure you use eye protection!
When a new moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, it causes a solar eclipse ( Figure below ).
The Moon casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks our view of the Sun.
This only happens if all three are lined up and in the same plane.
This plane is called the ecliptic.
The ecliptic is the plane of Earth’s orbit around the Sun.
The Moon’s shadow has two distinct parts.
The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow.
It is the part in which all of the light has been blocked.
The penumbra is the outer part of Moon’s shadow.
It is where the light is only partially blocked.
The moon's position during a solar eclipse
During a solar eclipse, the Moon casts a shadow on the Earth.
The shadow is made up of two parts: the darker umbra and the lighter penumbra.
When the Moon's shadow completely blocks the Sun, it is a total solar eclipse ( Figure below ).
