A supersaturated solution is a solution that contains more than the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved at a given temperature.
The recrystallization of the excess dissolved solute in a supersaturated solution can be initiated by the addition of a tiny crystal of solute, called a seed crystal.
The seed crystal provides a nucleation site on which the excess dissolved crystals can begin to grow.
Recrystallization from a supersaturated solution is typically very fast.
A supersaturated solution can recrystallize when a seed crystal is added to the solution.

Henry's Law tells us that the carbon dioxide in soda needs to be pressurized to stay in solution
How is sipping soda in outer space different then on Earth?
Having a soft drink in outer space poses some special problems.
Under microgravity, the carbonation could quickly dissipate if not kept under pressure.
