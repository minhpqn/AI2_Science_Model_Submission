Faults are seen on this geologic map cutting across rock layers.
When rock layers are tilted, you will see stripes of each layer on the map.
There are symbols on a geologic map that tell you which direction the rock layers slant.
Often there is a cut away diagram, called a cross section .
A cross section shows what the rock layers look like below the surface.
A large-scale geologic map will just show geologic provinces.
They do not show the detail of individual rock layers.
