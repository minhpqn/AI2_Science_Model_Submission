This pump will be discussed in the Active Transport:
The Sodium-Potassium Pump (Advanced) concept.
Other sources of energy for primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy (light energy).
Redox energy is used in the mitochondrial electron transport chain during cellular respiration.
In this transport, the reduction energy of NADH is used to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient.
An example of primary active transport using photon energy occurs during photosynthesis.
During photosynthesis, proteins use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.
That energy is used to pump H + ions into the thylakoid.
Secondary Active Transport
In secondary active transport, which is also known as cotransport , energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane.
However, in contrast to primary active transport, there is no direct coupling of ATP.
Instead, the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions out of the cell is used.
The process is called cotransport because one carrier protein mediates the transport of both substances.
The two main forms of this are antiport and symport.
Antiport and Symport
The difference between the two types of cotransport depends on the direction of transport of the molecules.
A system in which one substance moves in one direction while cotransporting another substance in the other direction is called antiport .
Symport is transport of two substrates in the same direction across the membrane.
The protein involved in this transport is a symporter.
The protein involved in antiport is an antiporter.
