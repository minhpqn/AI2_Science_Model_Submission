Is the question the scientists are trying to answer a bad question?
What are multiple working hypotheses?
What are the two hypotheses proposed to answer the question in this concept?
Identify and explain the steps required to test a hypothesis.
How can I show that my hypothesis is wrong?
Many young scientists learn that a good scientist tries to disprove her hypothesis.
This is the best way to be sure that your hypothesis is getting a rigorous test.
Why do you think established scientists tell students this?
Why is it a good idea?
How do you test a hypothesis?
Often you need scientific tools, perhaps a microscope or a magnetometer.
You need to know how to analyze the data that comes from those tools.
Often computers are needed to gather, analyze, and interpret the data.
In this example, we will look into the scientific literature to find data.
These studies were done using scientific method.
The scientists used the necessary tools and computers.
To test a new hypothesis, we would need to do the experiments ourselves.
We will test the two hypothesis that we developed to explain this fact:
Atmospheric CO 2 has increased over the past five decades.
Testing Hypothesis 1
