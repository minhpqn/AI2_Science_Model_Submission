Climate is the average weather in an area over a long period of time.
Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere from day to day.
Climate is generally described in terms of temperature and moisture.
Temperature falls from the equator to the poles.
Therefore, major temperature zones are based on latitude .
They include tropical, temperate, and arctic zones (see Figure below ).
However, other factors besides latitude may also influence temperature.
For example, land near the ocean may have cooler summers and warmer winters than land farther inland.
This is because water gains and loses heat more slowly than does land, and the water temperature influences the temperature on the coast.
Temperature also falls from lower to higher altitudes.
That’s why tropical zone mountain tops may be capped with snow.

What temperature zone do you live in?
In terms of moisture, climates can be classified as arid (dry), semi-arid, humid (wet), or semi-humid.
The amount of moisture depends on both precipitation and evaporation.
Precipitation increases moisture.
Evaporation decreases moisture.
The global pattern of precipitation is influenced by movements of air masses.
For example, there is a global belt of dry air masses and low precipitation at about 30° N and 30° S latitude.
