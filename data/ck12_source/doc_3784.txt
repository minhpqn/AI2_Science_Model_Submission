It also caused tremendous volcanic activity.
Mass extinctions occurred at the end of the Triassic and Cretaceous Periods.
The first extinction paved the way for a dinosaur takeover.
In the second extinction, the dinosaurs finally disappeared.
At the link below, you can watch a video about these and other exciting events during the age of dinosaurs.
The Mesozoic Era consists of the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods
The Mesozoic Era consists of the three periods described here.
The Triassic Period :
During the Triassic Period (245–200 million years ago), the first dinosaurs branched off from the reptiles and colonized the land, air, and water.
Huge seed ferns and conifers dominated the forests, and modern corals, fish, and insects evolved.
The supercontinent Pangaea started to separate into Laurasia (today’s Northern Hemisphere continents) and Gondwanaland (today’s Southern Hemisphere continents).
The Triassic Period ended with a mass extinction.
The Jurassic Period :
The next period, the Jurassic Period (200–145 million years ago), began after the mass extinction that ended the Triassic Period.
This mass extinction allowed dinosaurs to flourish in the Jurassic Period.
This was the golden age of dinosaurs.
Also during the Jurassic, the earliest birds evolved from reptile ancestors, and all the major groups of mammals evolved, though individual mammals were still small in size.
Flowering plants appeared for the first time, and new insects also evolved to pollinate the flowers.
The continents continued to move apart, and volcanic activity was especially intense.
The classic Steven Spielberg movie Jurassic Park realistically depicts some of the dinosaurs present during this period:  .
