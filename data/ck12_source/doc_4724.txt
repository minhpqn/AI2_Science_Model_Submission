Scientific theories are constructed in order to explain, predict, and understand phenomena.
This could include explanations for the movement of planets, weather patterns, or the behavior of animals.
In many instances we are constructing models of reality.
A theory makes generalizations about observations and is made up of a related set of ideas and models.
The important difference between theories and models is that the first is explanatory as well as descriptive, while the second is only descriptive and predictive in a much more limited sense.
A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological processes and concepts.
These organisms are chosen because it is believed that discoveries made in the model organism will provide insight into the workings of other organisms, including humans.
Model organisms range from single-celled bacteria to complex multi-cellular organisms.
Even some viruses are utilized as models, though technically a virus is not considered an organism.
The Table below lists some common model organisms.
All of these organisms listed have had their complete genomes sequenced.
