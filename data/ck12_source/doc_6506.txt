Both of these units are concerned with the disintegration rate of the radioactive isotope and give no indication of dosage to the target material.
Exposure gives an indication of the amount of radiation that travels through the air.
Two factors influence the amount of exposure a person may receive – time and intensity.
Acute exposure indicates a large amount of radiation received over a short period of time.
Chronic exposure deals with lower levels of exposure over a longer period of time.
Dose equivalence combines the amount of radiation received and the medical effect of that radiation.
Calculations of exposure and dose equivalence are complicated and will not be pursued at this time.
Measurement of exposure to radioactivity is important for anyone who deals with radioactive materials on a regular basis.
Perhaps the simplest device is a personal dosimeter – a film badge that will fog up when exposed to radiation.
The amount of fogging is proportional to the amount of radiation present.
These devices are not very sensitive to low levels of radiation.
More sensitive systems use crystals that respond in some way to radioactivity by registering the number of emissions in a given time.
These systems tend to be more sensitive and more reliable than film badges.
Dosimeters help measure personal exposure to radiation
A Geiger counter provides a sensitive means of detecting radioactivity.
A tube is filled with an inert gas, which will conduct electricity when radiation enters it.
When a charged particle comes into the tube, it changes the electrical potential between the anode and the cathode.
This change in potential in the tube produces a change in voltage in the electrical circuit and registers as a count.
Geiger counters are fairly inexpensive and reliable, so they are useful in a wide range of applications.
More complicated types of counters are also available, but are generally used in sophisticated experiments.
