As the water flows by, specialized collar cells (which are also known as choanocytes) filter out food particles such as bacteria.
Collar cells have tiny hairs that trap the particles.
They also have a flagellum that whips the water and keeps it moving.
Once the food is trapped, the collar cells digest it (see Figure below ).
Cells called amebocytes also help digest the food.
They distribute the nutrients to the rest of the body as well.
Finally, the water flows back out of the body through an opening called the osculum .
As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponge’s cells.
The cells also expel wastes into the water for removal through the osculum.

The collar cells of sponges trap and digest food.
Sponges reproduce both asexually and sexually.
Asexual reproduction occurs by budding.
Figure below shows the sponge life cycle when sexual reproduction is involved.
Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm.
In many species, the same individuals produce both.
However, they don’t produce eggs and sperm at the same time.
As a result, self-fertilization is unlikely to occur.
What is an advantage of avoiding self-fertilization?
