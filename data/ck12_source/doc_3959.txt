Annual temperature over the last 100 years
The average annual temperature on Earth has been rising for the past 100 years.
Most scientists agree that global warming is caused by more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (see Figure below ).
This increases the greenhouse effect.
There is more carbon dioxide mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels.
Destroying forests is another cause.
With fewer forests, less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis.

Effects of Climate Change
How has global warming affected Earth and its life?
Some of its effects include:
Decline in cold-adapted species such as polar bears.
Melting of glaciers and rising sea levels.
Coastal flooding and shoreline erosion.
Heat-related human health problems.
More droughts and water shortages.
Changing patterns of precipitation.
Increasing severity of storms.
Major crop losses.
