Without peristalsis, food would not be able to move through the digestive system.
Peristalsis is an involuntary process, which means that it occurs without your conscious control.
Peristalsis helps to move food through the digestive system
This diagram shows how muscles push food through the digestive system.
Muscle contractions travel through the system in waves, pushing the food ahead of them.
This is called peristalsis.
The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are also organs of the digestive system ( Figure above ).
Food does not pass through these three organs.
However, these organs are important for digestion.
They secrete or store enzymes or other chemicals that are needed to help digest food chemically.
Mouth, Esophagus, and Stomach
The mouth is the first organ that food enters.
But digestion may start even before you put the first bite of food into your mouth.
Just seeing or smelling food can cause the release of saliva and digestive enzymes in your mouth.
Once you start eating, saliva wets the food, which makes it easier to break up and swallow.
Digestive enzymes, including the enzyme amylase, start breaking down starches into sugars.
Your tongue helps mix the food with the saliva and enzymes.
Your teeth also help digest food.
Your front teeth are sharp.
They cut and tear food when you bite into it.
