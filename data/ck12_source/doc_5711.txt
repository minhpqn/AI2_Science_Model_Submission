Electrons can be situated in one of three planes in three dimensional space around a given nucleus  (x, y, and z) .
For a given value of the angular momentum quantum number l , there can be  (2l+1) values for m_l .
As an example:
l = 0  or 1
for l=0 , \ m_l=0
for l = 1, \ m_l = -1, \ 0, \ +1

Table above shows the possible magnetic quantum number values  (m_l) for the corresponding angular momentum quantum numbers (l) of l=0, \ l=1, \ l=2, and l=3 .
Spin Quantum Number  (m_s)
The spin quantum number describes the spin for a given electron.
An electron can have one of two associated spins, \left(+\frac{1}{2}\right) spin, or \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) spin.
An electron cannot have zero spin.
We also represent spin with arrows \uparrow or \downarrow .
A single orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons and each must have opposite spin.
Quantum numbers specify the arrangements of electrons in orbitals.
