As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder.
For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater.
Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper.
High-decibel sounds are dangerous.
They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.
Relationship between decibel level and intensity
Q:
How much louder than a 20-decibel whisper is the 60-decibel sound of a vacuum cleaner?
A:
The vacuum cleaner is 10,000 times louder than the whisper!
Amplitude and Distance
The intensity of sound waves determines the loudness of sounds, but what determines intensity?
Intensity results from two factors: the amplitude of the sound waves and how far they have traveled from the source of the sound.
Amplitude is a measure of the size of sound waves.
It depends on the amount of energy that started the waves.
Greater amplitude waves have more energy and greater intensity, so they sound louder.
For a video demonstration of the amplitude and loudness of sounds, go to this URL:
As sound waves travel farther from their source, the more spread out their energy becomes.
You can see how this works in the Figure below .
As distance from the sound source increases, the area covered by the sound waves increases.
