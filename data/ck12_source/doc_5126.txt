These are key events in the life of a cell.
This image depicts an animal cell in the final stages of cell division.
Essentially, the cell grows in size, the nucleus divides (mitosis), and then the cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis), forming new plasma membrane between the two genetically identical daughter cells.
Corresponding cell division in prokaryotes is known as binary fission .
In binary fission, the cell divides, but of course, there is no nucleus, so mitosis does not occur.
The DNA must still replicate prior to division.
For single-celled organisms, which includes all bacteria and single-celled eukaryotes, cell division is how that organism reproduces, creating an entirely new organism.
In another type of eukaryotic cell division called meiosis , a cell is permanently transformed into a haploid gamete, with half as much DNA as the parent cell, and may not divide again until fertilization.

binary fission :
Asexual reproduction in prokaryotic organisms; produces two identical cells.
cell :
The basic unit of structure and function of all living organisms.
cell cycle :
A repeating series of events, during which the eukaryotic cell carries out its necessary functions, including metabolism, cellular growth, DNA replication and cell division, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.
cell division :
The process of cell formation from the division of older cells.
chromosome :
The coiled structure of DNA and histone proteins; allows for the precise separation of replicated DNA; forms during prophase of mitosis and meiosis.
