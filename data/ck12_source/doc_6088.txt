The kinetic-molecular theory explains why.
The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire.
The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force.
The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode.
An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.
Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K).
On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K.
The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before.
As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles.
Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.
An increase in temperature causes an increase in pressure for a gas
Increase in temperature produces increase in pressure.
An increase in the number of gas molecules in the same volume container increases pressure.
A decrease in container volume increases gas pressure.
An increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container increases the pressure.
