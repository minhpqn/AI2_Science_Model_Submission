The vector for Chagas disease is shown in Figure below .
Trypanosoma parasites enter a person’s blood when the vector bites.
Then they spread to other tissues and organs.
The diseases may be fatal without medical treatment.
Vector for Chagas Disease.
In Chagas disease, the Trypanosoma parasite is spread by an insect commonly called the “kissing bug.” A bite from this bug could be the kiss of death.
The discovery of Chagas disease is unique in the history of medicine.
That’s because a single researcher—a Brazilian physician named Carlos Chagas—single-handedly identified and explained the new infectious disease.
In the early 1900s, Chagas did careful lab and field studies.
He determined the pathogen, vector, host, symptoms, and mode of transmission of the disease that is now named for him.
Giardia are flagellate protozoa that cause giardiasis .
The parasites enter the body through food or water that has been contaminated by feces of infected people or animals.
The protozoa attach to the lining of the host’s small intestine, where they prevent the host from fully absorbing nutrients.
They may also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.
A picture of a Giardia protozoan opens this concept.
Plasmodium protozoa cause malaria .
The parasites are spread by a mosquito vector.
Parasites enter a host’s blood through the bite of an infected mosquito.
The parasites infect the host’s red blood cells, causing symptoms such as fever, joint pain, anemia, and fatigue.
Malaria is common in tropical and subtropical climates throughout the world (see Figure below ).
