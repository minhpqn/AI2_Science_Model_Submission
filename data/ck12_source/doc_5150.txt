centriole :
A cylindrical shaped cell structure composed of nine triplets of microtubules; structure from which spindle fibers originate.
cytokinesis :
Division of the cytoplasm, forming two daughter cells.
kinetochore :
The protein structure on chromatids where the spindle fibers attach during cell division.
metaphase :
Phase of mitosis during which chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell.
metaphase plate :
The center (equator) of a cell during mitosis; chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate to ensure the proper separation of the sister chromatids.
mitosis :
The division of the nucleus into two genetically identical nuclei.
phragmosome :
A sheet of cytoplasm that forms in highly vacuolated plant cells to prepare for mitosis; forms in the approximate center of the cell.
preprophase :
Phase of mitosis prior to prophase; only in plant cells; ensures the nucleus is positioned in the center of the cell.
prometaphase :
Phase of mitosis during which the nuclear envelope breaks down, centrioles separate, and a spindle moves through the center of the cell.
prophase :
First phase of mitosis during which chromatin condense into chromosomes, the nuclear envelope breaks down, centrioles separate, and a spindle begins to form.
