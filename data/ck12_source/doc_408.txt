There are four valves of the heart.
The two atrioventricular (AV) valves stop blood from moving from the ventricles to the atria.
The two semilunar (SL) valves are found in the arteries leaving the heart, and they prevent blood from flowing back from the arteries into the ventricles.
Why does a heart beat?
The “lub-dub” sound of the heartbeat is caused by the closing of the AV valves ("lub") and SL valves ("dub") after blood has passed through them.
Blood flows from atria to ventricles in the heart
Blood flows in only one direction in the heart.
Blood enters the atria, which contract and push blood into the ventricles.
The atria relax and the ventricles fill with blood.
Finally, the ventricles contract and push blood around the body.
Blood enters the heart at the atria and then flows into the ventricles, which contract and push blood around the body.
Valves in the heart keep the blood flowing in one direction.
