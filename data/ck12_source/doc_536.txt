This is one type of meter used by people with diabetes to measure their blood sugar.
Modern meters like this one need only a drop of blood and take less than a minute to use.
Type 2 Diabetes
Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells are no longer sensitive to insulin.
The pancreas may still make insulin, but the cells of the body cannot use it efficiently.
Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood, but it is becoming more common in teens and children.
This is because more young people are overweight, due to a high sugar and fat diet, now than ever before.
Some cases of type 2 diabetes can be cured with weight loss.
However, most people with the disease need to take medicine to control their blood sugar.
Regular exercise and balanced eating also help, and should be a regular part of the treatment for these people.
Like people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes must frequently check their blood sugar.
Common symptoms of diabetes include the following:
feeling very thirsty
feeling very hungry, even though you are eating
cuts or bruises that are slow to heal
weight loss, even though you are eating more (type 1)
tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands or feet (type 2)
Complications of diabetes can include the following:
high blood pressure
