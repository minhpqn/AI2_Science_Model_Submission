There is no need to explicitly calculate the moles of Cl 2 .
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Since the given mass is less than half of the molar mass of chlorine, the resulting number of molecules is less than half of Avogadro’s number.
Calculations are illustrated for conversions between mass and number of particles.
Read the material at the link below and then do practice problems on page 9 and the problem on page 17 (don’t peak at the answers until you have tried the problems).
Why can’t we convert directly from number of particles to grams?
How many atoms of chlorine are present in the problem above?
The periodic table says the atomic weight of chlorine is 35.5.
Why can’t I use that value in my calculations?
Avogadro's Hypothesis and Molar Volume
State Avogadro’s hypothesis.
Define standard temperature and pressure.
Define molar volume.
Gas laws are used to determine the amount of air in a scuba tank
How do scuba divers know if they will run out of gas?
Knowing how much gas is available for a dive is crucial to the survival of the diver.
The tank on the diver’s back is equipped with gauges to tell how much gas is present and what the pressure is.
A basic knowledge of gas behavior allows the diver to assess how long to stay under water without developing problems.
