What is the human genome?
Discuss the importance of characterizing the human genome.
All these ACGTs.
What are they?
Over three billion of them from a human form the human genome - the human genetic material - all the information needed to encode a human being.
It would take about 9.5 years to read out loud - without stopping - the more than three billion pairs of bases in one person's genome.

What makes each one of us unique?
You could argue that the environment plays a role, and it does to some extent.
But most would agree that your parents have something to do with your uniqueness.
In fact, it is our genes that make each one of us unique â€“ or at least genetically unique.
A gene is a segment of DNA that has the instructions to encode a protein or RNA molecule and give you a trait.
We all have the genes that make us human: the genes for skin and bones, eyes and ears, fingers and toes, and so on.
However, we all have different skin colors, different bone sizes, different eye colors and different ear shapes.
In fact, even though we have the same genes, the products of these genes work a little differently in most of us.
