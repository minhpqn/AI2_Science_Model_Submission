You can't go to the mantle but small pieces of the mantle can come to you.
Kimberlite forms deep in the mantle and is erupted violently into the crust.
Kimberlite can contain diamonds.
Most kimberlites reached the surface much earlier in Earth history.
Beneath the crust is the mantle .
The mantle is made of hot, solid rock.
They know this because of seismic waves, meteorites, and the heat that comes from inside the planet.
Mantle rock is mostly peridotite , which is rich in iron and magnesium ( Figure below ).
Peridotite is rare at Earth's surface.
Peridotite is formed of crystals of olivine and pyroxene
The rock of the mantle is mostly peridotite.
Peridotite is formed of crystals of olivine (green) and pyroxene (black).
Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects ( Figure below ).
The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core.
In conduction , heat is transferred as atoms collide.

In the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects.
Hot lower mantle material rises upward ( Figure below ).
As it rises, it cools.
At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally.
