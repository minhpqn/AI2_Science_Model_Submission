They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair.
Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining.
Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life.
These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood.
Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans, and one of the main killers of people the world over.
A common cause of heart disease is arteriosclerosis.
This is the stiffening or hardening of the arteries that happens, in part, because of growing older.
Atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, is another cause of cardiovascular disease.
When fat accumulates along the walls of arteries, there is less space for blood to flow.
This makes it harder for blood to get to all the parts of the body that need it, including the heart itself.
The accumulation of fatty deposits, or plaque, can eventually lead to a heart attack or stroke.
Other changes to the heart occur during middle adulthood.
For example, to help the heart pump blood through stiffer blood vessels, some parts of the heart wall thicken.
The size of the four chambers of the heart also change, as do the valves between the chambers.
The resting heart rate does not change as you age, but the heart cannot beat as fast when you are physically active or stressed, as it did when you were younger.
Both genetic and lifestyle choices lead to heart disease.
Though you cannot change your genetic background, there are things you can do to slow or prevent the onset of heart disease, especially as you grow older.
