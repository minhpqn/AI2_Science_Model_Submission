Does the heart have muscles?
When you think of muscles, you might think of biceps and the external muscles you see in a bodybuilder.
However, some muscles are found deep inside your body.
The heart, for example, is a very muscular organ.
It has to pump blood all around your body.
Types of Muscles
The muscular system consists of all the muscles in the body.
This is the body system that allows us to move.
You also depend on many muscles to keep you alive.
Your heart, which is mostly muscle, pumps blood around your body.
Each muscle in the body is made up of cells called muscle fibers.
Muscle fibers are long, thin cells that can do something that other cells cannot doâ€”they are able to get shorter.
Shortening of muscle fibers is called contraction .
Muscle fibers can contract because they are made of proteins, called actin and myosin, that form long filaments (or fibers).
When muscles contract, these protein filaments slide or glide past one another, shortening the length of the cell.
When your muscles relax, the length extends back to the previous position.
Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction.
You can control some muscle movements.
However, certain muscle movements happen without you thinking about them.
Muscles that are under your conscious control are called voluntary muscles .
