DNA replication does not occur after meiosis I.
Notice how the chromosomes align in prophase I.
The alignment of homologous chromosomes allows for crossing-over, a process that increases genetic variability, which will be discussed in more detail in another concept.

chiasmata (singular, chiasma ):
The point where two homologous non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material during recombination (crossing-over).
crossing-over :
The exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes; also known as recombination.
diakinesis :
The fifth stage of prophase I; from Greek words meaning moving through.
dictyotene stage :
A prolonged resting phase in oogenesis; occurs in late prophase I; starts in fetal life and is terminated shortly before ovulation after puberty.
diplotene :
The fourth stage of prophase I; also known as diplonema, from Greek words meaning two threads.
genetic recombination :
The breaking and rejoining of DNA strands to form new molecules of DNA.
homologues :
A pair of chromosomes (one from each parent) consisting of two chromosomes that are similar in size, shape, and genes; also known as homologous chromosomes.
homologous recombination :
