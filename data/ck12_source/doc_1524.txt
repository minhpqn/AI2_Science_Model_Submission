Other molecules of air are pushing back.
Altitude and Air Pressure
Like density, the pressure of the air decreases with altitude.
There is less air pressing down from above the higher up you go.
Look at the bottle pictured below ( Figure below ).
It was drained by a hiker at the top of a mountain.
Then the hiker screwed the cap on the bottle and carried it down to sea level.
At the lower altitude, air pressure crushed it.
Can you explain why?
Water bottle collapsing due to greater air pressure at lower altitudes
At high altitude the air pressure is the same inside and outside the bottle.
At sea level, the pressure is greater outside than inside the bottle.
The greater outside pressure crushes the bottle.
Air density and pressure decrease with increasing altitude.
Ears pop as air pressures inside and outside of the ear equalize.
Gravity pulls more air molecules toward the center of the planet.
