Eat lots of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, smaller portions of lean meats and fish, and whole grains such as oats and whole wheat.
Limit saturated fats like butter, instead choose unsaturated vegetable oils such as canola oil.
Coronary Heart Disease
Like any other muscle, your heart needs oxygen.
Hearts have arteries that provide oxygen through the blood.
They are known as coronary arteries .
Coronary heart disease is the end result of the buildup of plaque within the walls of the coronary arteries.
Coronary heart disease often does not have any symptoms.
A symptom of coronary heart disease is chest pain.
Occasional chest pain can happen during times of stress or physical activity.
The pain of angina means the heart muscle fibers need more oxygen than they are getting.
Most people with coronary heart disease often have no symptoms for many years until they have a heart attack.
A heart attack happens when the blood cannot reach the heart because a blood vessel is blocked.
If cardiac muscle is starved of oxygen for more than roughly five minutes, it will die.
Cardiac muscle cells cannot be replaced, so once they die, they are dead forever.
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States.
The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can cause a heart attack and cause part of the heart muscle to die ( Figure below ).
Maybe one day stem cells will be used to replace dead cardiac muscle cells.
When the coronary artery gets blocked, the heart gets starved of oxygen and eventually dies
A blockage in a coronary artery stops oxygen from getting to part of the heart muscle, so areas of the heart that depend on the blood flow from the blocked artery are starved of oxygen.
