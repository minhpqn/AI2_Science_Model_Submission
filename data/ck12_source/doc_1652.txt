The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during mitosis.
The spindles separate sister chromatids from each other.
How DNA coils to make a chromosome
The DNA double helix wraps around proteins (2) and tightly coils a number of times to form a chromosome (5).
This figure shows the complexity of the coiling process.
The red dot shows the location of the centromere, which holds the sister chromatids together and is where the spindle microtubules attach during mitosis and meiosis.
Notice that a chromosome resembles an "X."
Four Phases of Mitosis
During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided.
This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it.
After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome.
Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid.
So, each chromosome after this separation is made of "1/2 of the X." Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome.
The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase ( Figure below ).
Prophase :
The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming chromosomes.
The DNA becomes so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope.
The membrane around the nucleus, called the nuclear envelope, disappears.
Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move.
Metaphase :
