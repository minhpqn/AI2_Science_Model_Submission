What is a courtship behavior.
Give an example.
Give an example of display behavior exhibited by a territorial animal.
Cyclic Behavior of Animals
Identify animal behaviors that occur in cycles.
Explain hibernation and migration.
Define circadian rhythms and biological clock.
What are these butterflies doing?
Monarch butterflies gather in large groups as they migrate 2,500 miles south each fall.
They return to the north in the spring.
This migration is a cycle that repeats every year.
Cycles of Behavior
Many animal behaviors change in a regular way.
They go through cycles.
Some cycles of behavior repeat each year.
Other cycles of behavior repeat every day.
An example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is hibernation .
Hibernation is a state in which an animalâ€™s body processes are slower than usual, and its body temperature falls.
An animal uses less energy than usual during hibernation.
This helps the animal survive during a time of year when food is scarce.
