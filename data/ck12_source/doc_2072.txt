The is on top of a precipice.
The rest of the ride runs on the potential energy the platform has when it is at the top.
Conservation of Energy
In this section, we're not talking about saving energy.
This section is about how energy cannot be created or destroyed.
Energy can only change forms.
So we say that energy is conserved.
Energy changes form when something happens.
But the total amount of energy always stays the same.
The Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
Scientists observed that energy could change from one form to another.
They also observed that the overall amount of energy did not change.
Here is an example of how energy changes form: kicking a soccer ball.
Your body gets energy from food.
Where does the food get its energy?
If you're eating a plant, then the energy comes directly from the Sun.
If you're eating an animal, then the energy comes from a plant that got its energy from the Sun.
Your body breaks down the food.
It converts the food to chemical energy and stores it.
When you are about to kick the ball, the energy must be changed again.
