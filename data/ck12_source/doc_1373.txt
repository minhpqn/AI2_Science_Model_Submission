Scientists measure the gases that escape from a volcano to predict eruptions.
Gases like sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water vapor can be measured at the site.
Gases may also be measured from satellites.
The amounts of gases and the ratios of gases are calculated to help predict eruptions.
Satellites can be used to monitor more than just gases ( Figure below ).
Satellites can look for high temperature spots or areas where the volcano surface is changing.
This allows scientists to detect changes accurately and safely.

Costs and Benefits of Predictions
No scientist or government agency wants to announce an eruption and then be wrong.
There is a very real cost and disruption to society during a large-scale evacuation.
If the scientists are wrong, people would be less likely to evacuate the next time scientists predicted an eruption.
But if scientists predict an eruption that does take place, it could save many lives.
Volcanologists use several lines of evidence to try to forecast volcanic eruptions.
Magma moving beneath a volcano will cause earthquakes and slope deformation.
Gases may be released from the magma out of the volcano vent.
Deciding whether to call for an evacuation is very tricky.
