Diagram showing how sugar dissolves in water
A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another.
The substance that dissolves is called the solute.
The substance that dissolves it is called the solvent.
Solutes and solvents may be any state of matter.
Many solutes dissolve in water because water is a very polar compound.
A general rule: like dissolves like.
For example, polar solvents dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes.
Ionic solutes separate into individual ions when they dissolve.
Covalent solutes separate into individual molecules.
