Single-replacement reactions only occur when the element that is doing the replacing is more reactive than the element that is being replaced.
Therefore, it is useful to have a list of elements in order of their relative reactivities.
The activity series is a list of elements in decreasing order of their reactivity.
Since metals replace other metals, while nonmetals replace other nonmetals, they each have a separate activity series.
The Table below is an activity series of most common metals and of the halogens.
Activity of Metals
Activity of Halogens
K       React with cold water, replacing
Al      React with steam, but not cold
Zn     water, replacing hydrogen.
Ni     Do not react with water.
React
Sn    with acids, replacing hydrogen.
Hg    Unreactive with water or acids.
For a single-replacement reaction, a given element is capable of replacing an element that is below it in the activity series.
This can be used to predict if a reaction will occur.
Suppose that small pieces of the metal nickel were placed into two separate aqueous solutions: one of iron(III) nitrate and one of lead(II) nitrate.
Looking at the activity series, we see that nickel is below iron, but above lead.
Therefore, the nickel metal will be capable of replacing the lead in a reaction, but will not be capable of replacing iron.
& \text{Ni}(s)+\text{Pb(NO}_3)_2(aq) \rightarrow \text{Ni(NO}_3)_2(aq)+\text{Pb}(s)\\& \text{Ni}(s)+\text{Fe(NO}_3)_3(aq) \rightarrow \text{NR (no reaction)}
