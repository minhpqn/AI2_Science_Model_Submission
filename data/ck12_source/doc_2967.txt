When the car slows down, you feel like you are being pushed forward, especially if the change in speed is sudden.
If the car changes direction and turns right, you feel as though you are being pushed to the left.
With a left turn, you feel a push to the right.
The next time you ride in a car, notice how it feels as the car accelerates in each of these ways.
You can also simulate acceleration at this URL:
Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object.
It measures the rate at which the change is occurring.
It may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both.
Like velocity, acceleration is a vector.
Examples of acceleration include a person riding a carousel and a skydiver in free fall.
When you experience acceleration, you may be able to feel the changes in speed and/or direction.
Watch the acceleration animation at the following URL.
Then answer the questions on the Web page and check to see if your answers are correct.
Describe an example of acceleration and explain how velocity is changing.
The skydiver pictured in the Figure above will soon open her parachute.
How will her velocity change when the parachute first opens?
Calculating Acceleration from Velocity and Time
Explain how to calculate average acceleration when direction is constant.
Identify the SI unit for acceleration.
