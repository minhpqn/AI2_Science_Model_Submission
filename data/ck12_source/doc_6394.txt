H + donor
H + acceptor
Lewis acids and bases are defined.
Examples of Lewis acids and bases are given.
Do the practice problems associated with Section 3 Lewis Theory at the link below:
What is the difference between a Lewis acid or base and a Br√∏nsted Lowry acid or base?
What is required to happen in Lewis acid-base reactions?
Do all Lewis acid-base reactions involve protons?
Lewis acid:
A substance that accepts a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond.
Lewis base:
A substance that donates a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond.
Ion-Product of Water
Define the ion-product constant of water.
Define acidic solution.
Define basic solution.
Use the constant to calculate [H + ] or [OH - ] when the other is known.
Car batteries contain sulfuric acid
At one time, you could take the little caps off the top of a car battery and check the condition of the sulfuric acid inside.
If it got low, you could add more acid.
