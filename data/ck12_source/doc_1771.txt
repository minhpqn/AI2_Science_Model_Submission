They created a good plan for reducing substances that destroy the ozone layer.
A treaty similar to the Montreal Protocol is needed for regulating greenhouse gases.
The Kyoto Protocol was passed in 1997.
The Protocol focused on controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
Many nations signed the protocol, but not all.
The United States, which at the time was the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, did not.
The U.S. is currently the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China.
Other treaties have been worked on but there has not been much progress.
There are many people, organizations and nations that think that this is too vague and too slow.
A stricter agreement must be reached very soon.
By doing nothing we are doing somethingâ€”continuing to raise greenhouse gas levels and failing to prepare for the coming environmental changes.
Efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions are mired in politics.
Meanwhile, crucial time is being lost.
Ways to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions
There are several possible ways to encourage organizations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
They include cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes, and carbon sequestration.
In a cap-and-trade system , each nation is given a cap on carbon dioxide emissions.
This is the most carbon dioxide the country is allowed to emit.
Sometimes a nation may need to go over its cap.
In that case, it can trade with another nation that is below its cap.
