Describe how sediment moves along the shore.
What function does a barrier island in its natural state serve?
Describe the barriers humans construct to protect beaches.
Why do you see man-made structures on some beaches?
When you go to a beach, you may see man-made structures like these.
Most attempt to keep the sand where people want the sand to be.
A smaller number keep the sand from coming into an area where it is not wanted.
Shores are attractive places to live and vacation.
But development at the shore is at risk of damage from waves.
Wave erosion threatens many homes and beaches on the ocean.
This is especially true during storms, when waves may be much larger than normal.
People build several types of structures to protect beaches.
Barrier islands provide natural protection to shorelines.
Storm waves strike the barrier island before they reach the shore.
People also build artificial barriers, called breakwaters .
Breakwaters also protect the shoreline from incoming waves.
The breakwater pictured below ( Figure below ) runs parallel to the coast like a barrier island.

This rocky breakwater protects the beach at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain.
Longshore drift can erode the sediment from a beach.
