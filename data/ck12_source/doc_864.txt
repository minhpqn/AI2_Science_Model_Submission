Abiotic factors such as soil quality, water, and climate will determine the species that continue the process of succession.
Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the newly created soil.
During early succession, plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over the landscape.
Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow.
Slowly, the shrubs are replaced by small trees.
Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees.
Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses, a forest may be the end result of primary succession.
Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already existed.
These areas already have soil full of nutrients.
Secondary succession is the type of succession that happens after something destroys the habitat, such as a flood or other natural disaster.
Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary succession ( Figure below ).
In this case, the pioneer species would be the grasses that first appear.
Lichen would not be necessary as there is already nutrient-rich soil.
Slowly, the field would return to its natural state.
Secondary succession occurs when nature reclaims areas formerly occupied by life
This land was once used for growing crops.
Now that the field is abandoned, secondary succession has begun.
Pioneer species, such as grasses, appear first, and then shrubs begin to grow.
A forest fire can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs ( Figure below and Figure below ).
Although the area will look devastated at first, the seeds of new plants are underground.
