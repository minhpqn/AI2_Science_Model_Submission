Mitochondria are called the "power plants" of the cell because they are the site of cellular respiration.
In cellular respiration, the energy from organic compounds such as glucose, is used to make ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ).
ATP is the cell's energy source that is used for such things such as movement and cell division.
Some ATP is made in the cytosol of the cell, but most of it is made inside mitochondria.
The number of mitochondria in a cell depends on the cell’s energy needs.
For example, active human muscle cells may have thousands of mitochondria, while less active red blood cells do not have any.
As the Figure below (a) and (b) shows, a mitochondrion has two phospholipids membranes.
The smooth outer membrane separates the mitochondrion from the cytosol.
The inner membrane has many folds, called cristae .
These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area for integral proteins.
Many proteins involved in cellular respiration are embedded in this inner membrane.
The greater surface area allows more proteins to be located there, resulting in more cellular respiration reactions, and more ATP synthesis.
ATP is produced by the enzyme ATP synthase, which is a membrane protein of the mitochondria inner membrane.
The fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrian, called matrix , is where most of the cell’s ATP is made.

Mitochondria range from 1 to 10 μm in size. (b):
This model of a mitochondrian shows the organized arrangement of the outer membrane and folded inner membrane with cristae, the inter membrane space, the mitochondrial matrix, and ATP synthase protein complex.
The mitochondria essentially has five compartments, each with its own function:
