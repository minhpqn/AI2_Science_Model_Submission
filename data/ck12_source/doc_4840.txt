As a result, virtually all life processes depend on water.
Clearly, without water, life as we know it could not exist.
anabolic reaction :
Endothermic reaction that occurs in organisms; chemical reaction that builds new molecules and/or stores energy.
catabolic reaction :
Chemical reaction that breaks down more complex organic molecules into simpler substances; usually releases energy.
cellular respiration :
Metabolic process which transfers chemical energy from glucose (a deliverable fuel molecule) to ATP (a usable energy-rich molecule); most efficient in the presence of oxygen (aerobic).
condensation reaction :
A chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form one single molecule, together with the loss of a small molecule, often water.
dehydration reaction :
A condensation reaction that involves the loss of water from the reacting molecule (product).
hydration reaction :
A chemical reaction in which a water molecule is added to a molecule, breaking the reactant into two separate products.
metabolism :
The sum of all the chemical reactions in a cell and/or organism.
photosynthesis :
The process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose and oxygen, using sunlight for energy.
Water is essential for most life processes, including photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and other important chemical reactions that occur in organisms.
