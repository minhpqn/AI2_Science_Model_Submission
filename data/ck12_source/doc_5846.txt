Uses for Transition Metals
Because there are so many metals in this group, there are a wide variety of uses.
Many of the metals are used in electronics, while others (such as gold and silver) are used in monetary systems.  Iron is a versatile structural material.  Cobalt, nickel, platinum, and other metals are employed as catalysts in a number of chemical reactions.  Zinc is a significant component of batteries.
