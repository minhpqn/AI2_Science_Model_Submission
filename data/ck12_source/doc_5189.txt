Next, the zygote's DNA is replicated.
Finally, the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells.
Through repeated rounds of growth and division, this organism becomes a diploid adult and the cycle continues.
This is the life cycle of humans.
Alternation of Generations
Plants, algae, and some protists have a life cycle that alternates between diploid and haploid phases, known as alternation of generations .
In plants, the life cycle alternates between the diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte .
Spore forming cells in the diploid sporophyte undergo meiosis to produce spores , a haploid reproductive cell.
Spores can develop into an adult without fusing with another cell.
The spores give rise to a multicellular haploid gametophyte, which produce gametes by mitosis.
The gametes fuse, producing a diploid zygote, which grow into the diploid sporophyte.
alternation of generations :
A life cycle that alternates between diploid and haploid phases.
diploid life cycle :
Life cycle with the majority of time spent as diploid adults.
gametophyte :
The gamete-producing phase in the alternation of generations life cycle; a haploid structure which produces gametes by mitosis.
haploid life cycle :
Life cycle with the majority of time spent as haploid organisms.
