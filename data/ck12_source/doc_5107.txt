How are bacterial cells different from your cells?
Describe the bacterial flagella.
Identify how bacteria aquire energy.
Explain the importance of chemosynthetic bacteria.
Can bacteria make their own food from sunlight?
Plants aren't the only organisms that use the energy of the sun to make food.
Some bacteria can also perform photosynthesis.
In fact, the first photosynthetic organisms on Earth were bacteria.
Photosynthesis is just one of many ways that bacteria can obtain energy.
Like all organisms, bacteria need energy, and they can acquire this energy through a number of different ways.
Photosynthetic bacteria use the energy of the sun to make their own food.
In the presence of sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are turned into glucose and oxygen.
The glucose is then turned into usable energy.
Glucose is like the "food" for the bacteria.
An example of photosynthetic bacteria is cyanobacteria, as seen in the opening image.
Bacteria known as decomposers break down wastes and dead organisms into smaller molecules.
These bacteria use the organic substrates they break down to get their energy, carbon, and nutrients they need for survival.
Bacteria can also be chemotrophs.
Chemosynthetic bacteria, or chemotrophs , obtain energy by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment.
An example of one of these chemicals broken down by bacteria is nitrogen-containing ammonia.
