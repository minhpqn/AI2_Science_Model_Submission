Flagella help bacteria move
The flagella facilitate movement in bacteria.
Bacteria may have one, two, or many flagellaâ€”or none at all.
Bacteria can be classified by their shape, including bacilli (rods), cocci (spheres), and spirilli (spirals)
Bacteria are like eukaryotic cells in that they have cytoplasm, ribosomes, and a plasma membrane.
Features that distinguish a bacterial cell from a eukaryotic cell include the circular DNA of the nucleoid, the lack of membrane-bound organelles, the cell wall of peptidoglycan, and flagella.
