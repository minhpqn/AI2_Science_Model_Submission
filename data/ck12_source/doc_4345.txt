Characteristics of the Five Vertebrate Groups  at
List three characteristics of each of the following:
Describe the vertebrate vertebral column, and list its functions.
Contrast cartilage and bone, and state the advantages of a bony endoskeleton relative to a cartilaginous endoskeleton.
Identify the components of the vertebrate nervous system.
What is an adaptive immune system?
Explain how vertebrates reproduce.
Distinguish between ovipary, ovovivipary, and vivipary.
Does the embryo develop in the mother or in an egg?
Is the egg within the mother or not?
Vertebrate reproduction occurs by one of three methods.
These bird eggs demonstrate one of three types of vertebrate reproduction.
Vertebrates reproduce sexually, and almost all of them have separate male and female sexes.
Recall that sexual reproduction is the joining of gametes during fertilization, producing genetically variable offspring.
Generally, aquatic species have external fertilization, whereas terrestrial species have internal fertilization.
Can you think of a reason why aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates differ in this way?
Vertebrates have one of the following three reproductive strategies: ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary.
Ovipary refers to the development of an embryo within an egg outside the mother’s body.
This occurs in most amphibians and reptiles and in all birds.
Ovovivipary refers to the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mother’s body until it hatches.
