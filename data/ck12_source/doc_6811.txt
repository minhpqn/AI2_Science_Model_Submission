We also know the frequency because we just found the period, so all we have to do is solve for the amplitude.
v(t)&=-2\pi fA\cos(2\pi f\Delta t) && \text{start with the equation for velocity}\\\v_{max}&=-2\pi fA\cos(2\pi f\frac{1}{4}T) && \text{put in the terms we know}\\\A&=-\frac{v_{max}}{2\pi f\cos(2\pi f\frac{1}{4}T)} && \text{solve for the amplitude}\\\A&=-\frac{2\:\text{m/s}}{2\pi \frac{1}{2}\:\text{Hz}*\cos(2\pi *\frac{1}{2}\:\text{Hz}*\frac{1}{4}*2\:\text{s})} && \text{plug in the known values}\\\A&=.63\:\text{m}

Pendulum Lab (PhET Simulation)
Why doesn’t the period of a pendulum depend on the mass of the pendulum weight?
Shouldn’t a heavier weight feel a stronger force of gravity?
The pendulum of a small clock is 1.553\;\mathrm{cm} long.
How many times does it go back and forth before the second hand goes forward one second?
On the moon, how long must a pendulum be if the period of one cycle is one second?
The acceleration of gravity on the moon is one sixth that of Earth.
Answers to Selected Problems
We have explored two examples of simple harmonic motion: the pendulum and the mass-spring system in the previous lesson.
The purpose of this investigation is to get you to notice the connections between the two systems.
Your task:
Match the period of the pendulum system with that of the spring system.
You are only allowed to change the mass involved in the spring system.
Consider the effective length of the pendulum to be fixed at 2m because that is the distance between the center of mass and the pivot.
The spring constant(13.5N/m) is also fixed.
You may use any relationships you have learned about to help you.
