Learned Behavior of Animals
Distinguish between learned behavior and innate behavior.
Explain observational learning
Give examples of conditioning.
Summarize learning by playing.
Define insight learning.
Do you play a sport?
If you play a sport like soccer, then you realize it takes a lot of work.
Remember how you didn't know at all what you were doing when you first started?
You had rules to figure out and skills to practice.
Playing a sport is an example of a learned behavior.
Just about all human behaviors are learned.
Learned behavior is behavior that occurs only after experience or practice.
Learned behavior has an advantage over innate behavior : it is more flexible.
Learned behavior can be changed if conditions change.
For example, you probably know the route from your house to your school.
Assume that you moved to a new house in a different place, so you had to take a different route to school.
What if following the old route was an innate behavior?
You would not be able to adapt.
Fortunately, it is a learned behavior.
