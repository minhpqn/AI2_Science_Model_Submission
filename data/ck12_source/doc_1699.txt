Severe thunderstorms have a lot of energy and strong winds.
This allows them to produce tornadoes.
A tornado ( Figure below ) is a funnel-shaped cloud of whirling high winds.
The funnel moves along the ground, destroying everything in its path.
As it moves, it loses energy.
Before this happens, it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles).
Fortunately, tornadoes are narrow.
They may be only 150 meters (500 feet) wide.
Tornadoes are also called twisters.

Tornadoes are small but mighty storms.
The winds of a tornado can reach very high speeds.
The faster the winds blow, the greater the damage they cause.
Wind speed and damage are used to classify tornadoes ( Table below ).
Wind Speed (kilometers per hour)
Wind Speed (miles per hour)
Light - tree branches fall and chimneys may collapse
Moderate - mobile homes, autos pushed aside
Considerable - roofs torn off houses, large trees uprooted
Severe - houses torn apart, trees uprooted, cars lifted
