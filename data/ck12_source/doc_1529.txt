All of the air you breathe is in the troposphere.
All of Earth's weather—wind, rain, snow, heat—is in the troposphere.
The troposphere is the lowest and most important layer of the atmosphere!
Properties of the Troposphere
The troposphere is the shortest layer of the atmosphere.
It rises to only about 12 kilometers (7 miles) above the surface.
Even so, this layer holds 75% of all the gas molecules in the atmosphere.
That’s because the air is densest in this layer.
In the troposphere, temperature decreases with altitude.
The troposphere gets some of its heat directly from the Sun.
Most, however, comes from Earth's surface.
The surface is heated by the Sun.
Some of that heat radiates back into the air.
This makes the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes.
Mixing of Air
Air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earth’s surface.
Warm air is less dense than cool air, so it rises higher in the troposphere.
This starts a convection cell.
Convection mixes the air in the troposphere.
Rising air is also a main cause of weather.
