The X chromosome has about 2,000 genes, whereas the Y chromosome has fewer than 100, none of which are essential to survival. (For comparison, the smallest autosome, chromosome 22, has over 500 genes.) Virtually all of the X chromosome genes are unrelated to sex.
Only the Y chromosome contains genes that determine sex.
A single Y chromosome gene, called SRY (which stands for sex-determining region Y gene), triggers an embryo to develop into a male.
Without a Y chromosome, an individual develops into a female, so you can think of female as the default sex of the human species.
Can you think of a reason why the Y chromosome is so much smaller than the X chromosome?
At the link that follows, you can watch an animation that explains why:
Humans have an estimated 20,000 to 22,000 genes.
This may sound like a lot, but it really isnâ€™t.
Far simpler species have almost as many genes as humans.
However, human cells use splicing and other processes to make multiple proteins from the instructions encoded in a single gene.
Of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, only about 25 percent make up genes and their regulatory elements.
The functions of many of the other base pairs are still unclear.
To learn more about the coding and noncoding sequences of human DNA, watch the animation at this link:
The majority of human genes have two or more possible alleles , which are alternative forms of a gene.
Differences in alleles account for the considerable genetic variation among people.
In fact, most human genetic variation is the result of differences in individual DNA bases within alleles.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Of these, 22 pairs are autosomes.
The X and Y chromosomes are the sex chromosomes.
Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y.
