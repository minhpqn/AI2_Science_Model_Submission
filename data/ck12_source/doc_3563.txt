How does ATP drive cellular processes?
The fact that all organisms use similar energy-carrying molecules shows one aspect of the grand "Unity of Life." Name two universal energy-carrying molecules, and explain why most organisms need both carriers rather than just one.
A single cell uses about 10 million ATP molecules per second.
Explain how cells use the energy and recycle the materials in ATP.
ATP and glucose are both molecules that organisms use for energy.
They are like the tank of a tanker truck that delivers gas to a gas station and the gas tank that holds the fuel for a car.
Which molecule is like the tank of the delivery truck, and which is like the gas tank of the car?
Explain your answer.
Summarize the chloroplast structure.
Describe the role of the chloroplast in photosynthesis.
Explain the significance of an electron transport chain.
What do pancakes and chloroplasts have in common?
The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis.
Part of the photosynthesis reactions occur in an internal membrane within the organelle.
The chloroplast contains many of these internal membranes, making photosynthesis very efficient.
These internal membranes stack on top of each other, just like a stack of pancakes.
Stages of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis occurs in two stages, which are shown in Figure below .
Stage I is called the light reactions .
This stage uses water and changes light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in ATP and NADPH (another energy-carrying molecule).
