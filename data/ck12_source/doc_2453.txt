Besides the northern lights, where are other examples of plasma in this picture?
A:
The stars consist of plasma.
Q:
What properties of plasma do you think explain why this state of matter is used in artificial lights?
A:
Plasma consists of charged particles called ions, so it conducts electric current and glows when electricity passes through it.
These properties explain why plasma is used in artificial lights.
Plasma is a state of matter that lacks a fixed volume and a fixed shape and consists of charged particles called ions.
Because it consists of charged particles, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to a magnetic field.
The sun and other stars consist of plasma.
Plasma is also found naturally in lightning and the northern and southern lights.
Human-made plasma is found in fluorescent lights, plasma TV screens, and plasma spheres.
