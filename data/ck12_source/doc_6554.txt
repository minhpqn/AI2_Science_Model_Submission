Following are three examples of alcohols and their IUPAC names.
Nomenclature of three alcohols
Aliphatic alcohols can be classified according to the number of R groups attached to the carbon with the hydroxyl group.
If one R group is attached to that carbon, the alcohol is a primary alcohol.
If two R groups are attached, the alcohol is a secondary alcohol.
If three R groups are attached, the alcohol is a tertiary alcohol.
Shown below is an example of each.
The primary alcohol is 1-propanol, the secondary alcohol is 2-butanol, and the tertiary alcohol is 2-methy-2-propanol.
Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols
Properties of Alcohols
The smallest and lightest alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol) are completely soluble in water in all proportions.
In a solution, the hydroxyl groups of alcohol molecules and the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other, resulting in complete miscibility.
However, as the length of the carbon chain increases, the solubility decreases.
The solubility of 1-butanol is 7.4 g per 100 g of water, while that of 1-pentanol is 2.7 g per 100 g water, and 1-octanol is 0.06 g per 100 g water.
The carbon chain portion of the larger alcohol molecule is nonpolar and leads to the decreased solubility of the overall compound.
The presence of hydrogen bonds in alcohols also explains the relatively high boiling points of alcohols compared to alkanes of similar molar mass (see Table below ).
