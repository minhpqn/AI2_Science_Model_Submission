chlorophyll :
The primary pigment of photosynthesis; found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
FADH 2 :
Flavin adenine dinucleotide; an energy carrier molecule produced during the Krebs cycle of aerobic cellular respiration.
glucose :
The carbohydrate product of photosynthesis; it serves as the universal fuel for life:
C 6 H 12 O 6 .
NADH :
Short-term energy carrier; temporarily stores energy during cellular respiration; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
NADP + (NADPH) :
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; an energy carrier molecule produced in the light reactions of photosynthesis;
NADPH is the reduced form of NADP + .
photosynthesis :
The process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose and oxygen, using sunlight for energy.
All organisms use similar energy-carrying molecules for food and to carry out life processes.
Glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ,) is a nearly universal fuel delivered to cells, and the primary product of photosynthesis.
ATP molecules store smaller amounts of energy and are used within cells to do work.
Chlorophyll and NADPH molecules hold energy temporarily during the process of photosynthesis.
The fact that all organisms use similar energy-carrying molecules shows one aspect of the grand "Unity of Life." Name two universal energy-carrying molecules, and explain why most organisms need both carriers rather than just one.
A single cell may use millions of ATP molecules each second.
