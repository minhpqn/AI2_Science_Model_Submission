Organisms are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells.
The matter is structured in an ordered way.
Atoms are arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules, which make up organelles, which work together to form cells.
Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire multicellular organisms, as shown in Figure below .
Cells together form tissues, which make up organs, which are part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism.
Of course, beyond this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem.
All of Earth's ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is Earth.
