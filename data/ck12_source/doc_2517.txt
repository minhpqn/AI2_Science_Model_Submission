It’s often useful to have ways to signify different people or objects like athletes on teams.
The same is true of atoms.
It’s important to be able to distinguish atoms of one element from atoms of other elements.
Elements are pure substances that make up all other matter, so each one is given a unique name.
The names of elements are also represented by unique one- or two-letter symbols, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon, and He for helium.
You can see other examples in the Figure below .
The periodic table
Q:
The table shown in the Figure above is called the periodic table of the elements.
Each symbol stands for a different element.
What do you think the symbol K stands for?
A:
The symbol K stands for the element potassium.
The symbol comes from the Latin name for potassium, which is kalium .
The symbols in the Figure above would be more useful if they revealed more information about the atoms they represent.
For example, it would be useful to know the numbers of protons and neutrons in the atoms.
That’s where atomic number and mass number come in.
The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number .
This number is very important because it is unique for atoms of a given element.
All atoms of an element have the same number of protons, and every element has a different number of protons in its atoms.
