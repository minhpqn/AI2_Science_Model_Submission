This way, a seed will be produced that can turn into a genetically identical plant.
Cross-fertilization:
Pollen from one flower travels to a stigma of a flower on another plant.
Pollen travels from flower to flower by wind or by animals.
Flowers that are pollinated by animals such as birds, butterflies, or bees are often colorful and provide nectar, a sugary reward, for their animal pollinators.
Why Are Angiosperms Important to Humans?
Angiosperms are important to humans in many ways, but the most significant role of angiosperms is as food.
Wheat, rye, corn, and other grains are all harvested from flowering plants.
Starchy foods, such as potatoes, and legumes, such as beans, are also angiosperms.
And, as mentioned previously, fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase seed dispersal and are nutritious.
There are also many non-food uses of angiosperms that are important to society.
For example, cotton and other plants are used to make cloth, and hardwood trees are used for lumber.
Angiosperms are plants that produce flowers and fruit.
Angiosperms can be self-pollinated, meaning pollen falls on the stigma of the same flower, or cross-fertilized, during which pollen from one flower travels to a stigma of a flower on another plant.
