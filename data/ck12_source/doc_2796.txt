Solubility of various compounds
Q:
Assume that a solution contains 150 grams of Epsom salt in 1 liter of water at 20 °C.
Is the solution saturated or unsaturated?
A:
A saturated solution of Epsom salt in 1 liter of 20 °C water would contain 250 grams of Epsom salt.
Therefore, this solution is unsaturated.
It can hold another 100 grams of Epsom salt.
Q:
What do you think would happen if you added more than 250 grams of Epsom salt to a liter of 20 °C water?
A:
Any Epsom salt over 250 grams would not dissolve in the solution.
A saturated solution is a solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature.
An unsaturated solution is a solution that contains less solute than can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature.
Solutes differ in their solubility in a given solvent.
Therefore, a saturated solution of one solute might contain more or less solute than a saturated solution of a different solute.

Pay special attention to minutes 3:50–6:55 (the section on saturation).
Then answer the questions below.
Describe how particles of solute behave when a solution is saturated.
