The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization.
It may occur when atoms are exposed to high levels of radiation.
The radiation may give their outer electrons enough energy to escape from the attraction of the positive nucleus.
However, most ions form when atoms transfer electrons to or from other atoms or molecules.
For example, sodium atoms may transfer electrons to chlorine atoms.
This forms positive sodium ions (Na + ) and negative chloride ions (Cl - ).

Q:
Why do you think atoms lose electrons to, or gain electrons from, other atoms?
A:
Atoms form ions by losing or gaining electrons because it makes them more stable and this state takes less energy to maintain.
The most stable state for an atom is to have its outermost energy level filled with the maximum possible number of electrons.
In the case of metals such as lithium, with just one electron in the outermost energy level, a more stable state can be achieved by losing that one outer electron.
In the case of nonmetals such as fluorine, which has seven electrons in the outermost energy level, a more stable state can be achieved by gaining one electron and filling up the outer energy level.

Properties of Ions
Ions are highly reactive, especially as gases.
They usually react with ions of opposite charge to form neutral compounds.
