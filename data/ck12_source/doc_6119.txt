2.91 mol O 2
P_{\text{Total}}=104 \ \text{kPa}
P_{H_2}=? \ \text{kPa}
P_{O_2}=? \ \text{kPa}
First, the mole fraction of each gas can be determined.
Then, the partial pressure can be calculated by multiplying the mole fraction by the total pressure.
Step 2:
Solve .
& X_{H_2}=\frac{1.24 \ \text{mol}}{1.24 \ \text{mol} + 2.91 \ \text{mol}}=0.299 && X_{O_2}=\frac{2.91 \ \text{mol}}{1.24 \ \text{mol} + 2.91 \ \text{mol}}=0.701 \\& P_{H_2}=0.299 \times 104 \text{ kPa}=31.1 \text{ kPa} && P_{O_2}=0.701 \times 104 \text{ kPa}=72.9 \text{ kPa}
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The hydrogen is slightly less than one third of the mixture, so it exerts slightly less than one third of the total pressure.
Use of the mole fraction allows calculation to be made for mixtures of gases.
