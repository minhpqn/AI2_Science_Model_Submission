How small would the smallest pieces be?
Just a Guess
Democritus’ idea of the atom has been called “the best guess in antiquity.” That’s because it was correct in many ways, yet it was based on pure speculation.
It really was just a guess.
Here’s what Democritus thought about the atom:
All matter consists of atoms, which cannot be further subdivided into smaller particles.
Atoms are extremely small—too small to see.
Atoms are solid particles that are indestructible.
Atoms are separated from one another by emptiness, or “void.”
Q:
How are Democritus’ ideas about atoms similar to modern ideas about atoms?
A:
Modern ideas agree that all matter is made up of extremely small building blocks called atoms.
Q:
How are Democritus’ ideas different from modern ideas?
A:
Although atoms are extremely small, it is now possible to see them with very powerful microscopes.
Atoms also aren’t the solid, uncuttable particles Democritus thought.
Instead, they consist of several kinds of smaller, simpler particles as well as a lot of empty space.
In addition, atoms aren’t really indestructible because they can be changed to other forms of matter or energy.
