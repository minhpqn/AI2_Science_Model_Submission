Continents drifted.
They collided to form a gigantic supercontinent and then broke up again and moved apart.
Continental drift changed climates worldwide and caused intense volcanic activity.

Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rose and fell.
This was due to volcanic activity and other factors.
When the levels were high, they created a greenhouse effect .
More heat was trapped on Earth’s surface, and the climate became warmer.
When the levels were low, less heat was trapped and the planet cooled.
Several times, cooling was severe enough to plunge Earth into an ice age.
One ice age was so cold that snow and ice completely covered the planet.
Earth during this ice age has been called snowball Earth (see Figure below ).
Snowball Earth during the early Precambrian
Snowball Earth.
During the late Precambrian, Earth grew so cold that it was covered with snow and ice.
Earth during this ice age has been called snowball Earth.
Life During the Late Precambrian
The dramatic changes of the late Precambrian had a major impact on Earth’s life forms.
Living things that could not adapt died out.
They were replaced by organisms that evolved new adaptations.
