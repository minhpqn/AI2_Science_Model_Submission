According to his theory the natural state of things is at rest; force is required to keep something moving at a constant rate.
This made sense to people throughout history because on earth, friction and air resistance slow moving objects.
When there is no air resistance (or other sources of friction), a situation approximated in space, Newton's first law is much more evident.
The amount of inertia an object has is simply related to the mass of the object.
Mass and Weight are two different things.
Mass (typically in units of kg or grams) is basically a measure of what comprises an object.
Weight is the measure of how much the force of gravity is pulling on you.
In fact, instead of saying 'I weigh 80 lb.', one could say that 'the force of gravity is pulling on me with a force of 80 lb.' The metric unit for weight (and force) is the Newton.
F_g = mg  ;
The force of gravity (i.e. your weight) is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration of gravity for that planet.
1 \text{lb.} = 4.45 \text{N}
An object will not change its state of motion (i.e., accelerate) unless a net force acts on it.
Equal and oppositely directed forces do not produce acceleration.
If no net force acts on an object the object remains at constant velocity or at rest.
Question :
What is the weight of a 90 kg person on Earth?
What about the moon?
Answers :
On Earth, F_g = mg = (90 \ kg)(9.8 \ m/s^2) = 882 \ N
On moon, F_g = mg = (90 \ kg)(1.6 \ m/s^2) = 144 \ N
