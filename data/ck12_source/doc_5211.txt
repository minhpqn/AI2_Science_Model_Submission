Identify the relationship between genes and alleles.
What were Mendel's four hypotheses?
Summarize the law of segregation.
Mendel's Second Experiment - Advanced
Outline the Law of Independent Assortment.
Round and green, round and yellow, wrinkled and green, or wrinkled and yellow?
Can two traits be inherited together?
Or are all traits inherited separately?
Mendel asked these questions after his first round of experiments.
And the answer to the first question is Yes.
And the answer to the second question is also Yes.
And Mendel's work began to explain how this is so.
Mendelâ€™s Second Experiment
After Mendel's first set of experiments, Mendel wanted to see if the inheritance of characteristics were dependent, or were they independent events.
Mendel asked if the segregation of the heritable factors (allele) for one characteristic (gene) had any effect of the segregation of the factors for another characteristic.
For example, did the segregation of the flower color factors have any effect on the segregation of the seed shape factors?
So Mendel performed crosses in which he followed the segregation of two genes.
Mendel crossed pea plants that differed in two characteristics, such as seed color and shape.
A dihybrid cross is a cross in which the inheritance of two characteristics are tracked at the same time.
The offspring of such a cross are called dihybrids .
