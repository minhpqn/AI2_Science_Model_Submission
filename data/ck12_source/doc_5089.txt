However, anaerobic respiration has persisted far longer on this planet, through major changes in atmosphere and life.
There must be value in this alternative way of making ATP.
E. coli bacteria are anaerobic bacteria that live in the human digestive tract.
A major argument in favor of aerobic over anaerobic respiration is overall energy production.
Without oxygen, organisms can only break a 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.
As we saw earlier, glycolysis releases only enough energy to produce two (net) ATPs per molecule of glucose.
In anaerobic respiration, this is where ATP production stops.
There is a final total of only two ATPs produced per molecule of glucose.
This anaerobic process does occur very quickly though.
For example, it lets your muscles get the energy they need for short bursts of intense activity.
The muscles of these hurdlers need to use anaerobic respiration for energy.
It gives them the energy they need for the short-term, intense activity of this sport.
Aerobic respiration, on the other hand, produces ATP more slowly.
It does, however, break glucose all the way down to CO 2 , producing up to 38 ATPs.
Membrane transport (active transport) costs can slightly reduce this theoretical yield, but aerobic respiration consistently produces at least 15 times as much ATP as anaerobic respiration.
This vast increase in energy production probably explains why aerobic organisms have come to dominate life on earth.
It may also explain how organisms were able to increase in size, adding multicellularity and great diversity.
However, anaerobic pathways do persist, and obligate anaerobes have survived over 2 billion years beyond the evolution of aerobic respiration.
So there must be advantages to fermentation.
What are these advantages?
