How much organic material do they contain?
What is pedalfer?
How much chemical weathering leads to this soil type and why?

What is laterite?
How much chemical weathering leads to this soil type and why?
What is the plant life found with laterite soils?
If a forest is leveled so that a laterite soil is exposed to the Sun, what happens to it?
Explain how human activities cause soil erosion.
Could it happen again?
Farmers were forced off their lands during the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.
The rains stopped, and the topsoil blew off these former grasslands.
This scene was repeated throughout the central United States.
During long droughts, some people wonder if another dust bowl could come.

The same agents that erode landscapes also erode soil.
They are water, wind, ice, or gravity.
Running water is the leading cause of soil erosion.
Water is abundant and has a lot of power.
Wind is also a leading cause of soil erosion.
