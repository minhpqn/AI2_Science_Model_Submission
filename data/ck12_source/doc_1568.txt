These pollutants include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.
Motor vehicles account for almost half of fossil fuel use.
Power plants and factories account for more than a quarter of fossil fuel use ( Figure below ).
Homes and other buildings burn fossil fuels.
Pollution from a power plant
Smoke stacks release a lot of pollutants into the air.
Millions of acres of forest have been cut and burned to make way for farming ( Figure below ).
Burning trees produces most of the same pollutants as burning fossil fuels.
Cutting and burning trees to clear land for farming is called slash-and-burn agriculture.
How does this affect the atmosphere?
Evaporation of VOCs
VOCs enter the air by evaporation.
VOCs are found in many products, like paints and petroleum products.
Methane is a VOC that evaporates from livestock waste and landfills.
There are many types of primary pollutants, including carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulates, lead, and volatile organic compounds.
Secondary pollutants form from chemical reactions that occur when pollution is exposed to sunlight.
Most pollutants enter the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning.
Burning forests and evaporation of some chemicals account for most of the rest.
