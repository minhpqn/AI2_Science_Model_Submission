These include the western blot and northern blot.
These procedures analyze proteins and RNA, respectively.
RFLP and Southern blot analysis involved several steps:
First, the DNA being analyzed is cut into different-sized pieces using restriction enzymes.
The resulting DNA fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis.
Next, an alkaline solution or heat is applied to the gel so that the DNA denatures and separates into single strands.
Nitrocellulose paper is pressed evenly against the gel and then baked so the DNA is permanently attached to it.
The DNA is now ready to be analyzed using a radioactive single-stranded DNA probe in a hybridization reaction.
After hybridization, excess probe is washed from the membrane, and the pattern of hybridization is visualized on X-ray film by autoradiography ( Figure below ).
Mutations can create or abolish restriction enzyme (RE) recognition sites, thus affecting quantities and length of DNA fragments resulting from RE digestion.
Hybridization is when two genetic sequences bind together because of the hydrogen bonds that form between the base pairs.
To make hybridization work, the radioactive probe has to be denatured so that it is single-stranded.
The denatured probe and the Southern blot are incubated together, allowing the probe to bind to the corresponding fragment on the Southern blot.
The probe will bond to the denatured DNA wherever it finds a fit.
Hybridization of a probe made to a variable segment of DNA will produce a DNA fingerprint pattern specific for an individual.
This procedure has a number of steps and is very labor intensive.
PCR-based methods are much simpler.
