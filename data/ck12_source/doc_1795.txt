Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of a glacier scrape against the rock below.
If you have ever collected beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion.
Rocks that have been worn smooth due to abrasion
Water flowing through river or beach cobbles causes them to hit each other.
This contact causes abrasion, which makes the rocks round.
Plants and Animals in Mechanical Weathering
Sometimes plants or animals cause mechanical weathering.
This can happen slowly.
A plantâ€™s roots grow into a crack in rock.
As the roots grow larger, they wedge open the crack ( Figure below ).
Burrowing animals can also cause weathering.
By digging for food or creating a hole to live, in the animal may break apart rock.
Plant roots can cause mechanical weathering
The large roots of this tree can break apart rock.
This is mechanical weathering.
Humans and Mechanical Weathering
Today, human beings do a lot of mechanical weathering whenever we dig or blast into rock.
This is common when we build homes, roads, and subways, or quarry stone for construction or other uses.
Mechanical weathering breaks down existing rocks and minerals.
Mechanical weathering keeps the chemical makeup of materials the same.
