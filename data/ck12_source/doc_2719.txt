How Fast Does It Go?
How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the reaction rate .
Several factors affect the rate of a given chemical reaction.
They include the:
temperature of reactants.
concentration of reactants.
surface area of reactants.
presence of a catalyst.
At the following URL, you can see animations showing how these factors affect the rate of chemical reactions.
Temperature of Reactants
When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster.
At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster.
As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force.
For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).
This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ).
The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.
