hydrolysis reaction :
A chemical process in which a molecule of water is split, resulting in the separation of a large molecule into two smaller molecules.
isomers :
Molecules with the same chemical formula but with differently arranged atoms.
monosaccharide :
A simple sugar such as glucose; the building block of carbohydrates.
oligosaccharide :
A saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of monosaccharides.
polysaccharide :
A chain of monosaccharides; a complex carbohydrate such as starch or glycogen.
starch :
A carbohydrate used for long-term energy storage in plant cells.
Carbohydrates are organic molecules that consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
They are made up of repeating units called saccharides.
They provide cells with energy, store energy, and form structural tissues.
