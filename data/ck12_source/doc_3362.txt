Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism.
In 1820, Oersted discovered by accident that electric current creates a magnetic field.
Prior to that, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated.
Oersted also used a compass to find the direction of the magnetic field around a wire carrying current.
Around 1830, Michael Faraday discovered that a magnetic field can generate an electric current if a conductor crosses the lines of force in a magnetic field.
This is known as Faraday’s law.
