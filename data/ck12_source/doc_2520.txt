Describe the atomic mass unit.
What does it represent and what does it equal?
The symbol below represents an isotope of helium.
How many protons and neutrons does it have?
All carbon atoms have six protons.
Most also have six neutrons, but some have seven or eight neutrons.
What is the mass number of a carbon isotope that has seven neutrons?
State why atoms are neutral in electric charge.
Explain how ions form.
Identify properties of ions.
The incredible green lights in this cold northern sky consist of charged particles known as ions.
Their swirling pattern is caused by the pull of Earth’s magnetic north pole.
Called the northern lights, this phenomenon of nature shows that ions respond to a magnetic field.
Do you know what ions are?
Read on to find out.
Atoms Are Neutral
The northern lights aren’t caused by atoms, because atoms are not charged particles.
An atom always has the same number of electrons as protons.
Electrons have an electric charge of -1 and protons have an electric charge of +1.
Therefore, the charges of an atom’s electrons and protons “cancel out.” This explains why atoms are neutral in electric charge.
