At the end of this period of rapid evolution, the life forms do not look much like the ones that were around before the mass extinction.
One example came after the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Mammals underwent adaptive radiation and became the dominant life form.
Although they lived in the habitats the dinosaurs had lived in, they didn't look much like the dinosaurs.
Species go extinct when all of the individuals die out or evolve into a different species.
Many species go extinct at roughly the same time during a mass extinction.
New habitats become available and species evolve to fill them so that biodiversity increases during adaptive radiation.
