Define nuclear fusion.
Describe nuclear fusion reactions.
The sun is powered at nuclear fusion
How are elements born?
A number of reactions take place in the sun that cannot be duplicated on Earth.
Some of these reactions involve the formation of large elements from smaller ones.
So far, we have only been able to observe formation of very small elements here on Earth.
The reaction sequence observed appears to be the following:
Hydrogen-1 atoms collide to form the larger hydrogen isotopes, hydrogen-2 (deuterium) and hydrogen-3 (tritium).
In the process, positrons and gamma rays are formed.
The positrons will collide with any available electrons and annihilate, producing more gamma rays.
In the process, tremendous amounts of energy are produced to keep us warm and continue supplying reactions.
In contrast to nuclear fission, which results in smaller isotopes being formed from larger ones, the goal of nuclear fusion is to produce larger materials from the collision of smaller atoms.
The forcing of the smaller atoms together results in tighter packing and the release of energy.
As seen in Figure below , energy is released in the formation of the larger atom, helium (He)  from the fusion of hydrogen-2 and hydrogen-3 as well as from the expulsion of a neutron.
Fusion of hydrogen 2 and hydrogen 3 creates helium 4
Nuclear fusion reaction between deuterium and tritium.
This release of energy is what drives research on fusion reactors today.
If such a reaction could be accomplished efficiently on Earth, it could provide a clean source of nuclear energy.
Unlike fission reactions, nuclear fusion does not produce radioactive products that represent hazards to living systems.
