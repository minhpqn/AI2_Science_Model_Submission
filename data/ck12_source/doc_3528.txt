Nine groups of three microtubules make up each centriole.
Two perpendicular centrioles make up the centrosome .
Centrioles are very important in cellular division, where they arrange the mitotic spindles that pull the chromosome apart during mitosis.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in the synthesis of lipids and synthesis and transport of proteins.
The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell.
Vesicles are also used as chemical reaction chambers.
Transport vesicles, lysosomes, and peroxisomes are types of vesicles.
Vacuoles have secretory, excretory, and storage functions.
Centrioles are made of short microtubules and are very important in cell division.

Organelles and Their Functions at
Describe rough and smooth ER.
Why is the ER described as the "highways and road systems?"
Why is the Golgi apparatus similar to a post office?
Vesicles and vacuoles can be referred to as “warehouses, water towers or garbage dumps.” Explain this.

List five organelles eukaryotes have that prokaryotes do not have.
Explain how the following organelles ensure that a cell has the proteins it needs: nucleus, rough ER, vesicles, and Golgi apparatus.
What is the main difference between rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum?
