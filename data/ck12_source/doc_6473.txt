What metals are low in the activity series?
Is tin easier to oxidize than magnesium?
direct redox reaction:
Electrons flow directly from the atoms of the metal to the cations of the other metal.
Describe an electrochemical reaction.
List the components of an electrochemical reaction.
Outdoor sculptures will generally rust if they are not protected
What happened to that sculpture?
Metal exposed to the outside elements will usually corrode if not protected.
The corrosion process is a series of redox reactions involving the metal of the sculpture.
In some situations, the metals are deliberately left unprotected so that the surface will undergo changes that may enhance the esthetic value of the work.
Chemical reactions either absorb or release energy, which can be in the form of electricity.
Electrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with the interconversion of chemical energy and electrical energy.
Electrochemistry has many common applications in everyday life.
All sorts of batteries, from those used to power a flashlight to a calculator to an automobile, rely on chemical reactions to generate electricity.
Electricity is used to plate objects with decorative metals like gold or chromium.
Electrochemistry is important in the transmission of nerve impulses in biological systems.
Redox chemistry, the transfer of electrons, is behind all electrochemical processes.
The reaction of zinc metal with copper(II) ions is called a direct redox process or reaction.
The electrons that are transferred in the reaction go directly from the Zn atoms on the surface of the strip to the Cu 2+ ions in the area of the solution right next to the zinc strip.
