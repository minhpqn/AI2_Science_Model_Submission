Define lone pair.
Describe how lone pair electrons influence molecular geometry.
Packing a suitcase is like packing electrons on an atom
How can all these clothes fit into such a small space?
When we travel, we often take a lot more stuff than we need.  Trying to fit it all in a suitcase can be a real challenge.  We may have to repack or just squeeze it all in.  Atoms often have to rearrange where the electrons are in order to create a more stable structure.
Central Atom with One or More Lone Pairs
The molecular geometries of molecules change when the central atom has one or more lone pairs of electrons.  The total number of electron pairs, both bonding pairs and lone pairs, leads to what is called the electron domain geometry.
