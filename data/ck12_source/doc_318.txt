Human Biology provides an overview of the physiology of humans, from the skin inward.
In addition to the skin, the skeletal, muscular, nervous, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, immune, and reproductive systems are described.
Organization of the Human Body
List the levels of organization in the human body.
Define cell, tissue, organ, and organ system.
Identify the four types of tissues that make up the body.
Give examples of organ systems and their functions.
Do cells work together?
Cells, like these nerve cells, do not work in isolation.
To send orders from your brain to your legs, for example, signals pass through many nerve cells.
These cells work together to perform a similar function.
Just as muscle cells work together, bone cells and many other cells do as well.
A group of similar cells that work together is known as a tissue.
Organization of Your Body:
Cells, Tissues, Organs
Cells are grouped together to carry out specific functions.
A group of cells that work together form a tissue .
Your body has four main types of tissues, as do the bodies of other animals.
These tissues make up all structures and contents of your body.
An example of each tissue type is pictured in the Figure below .
