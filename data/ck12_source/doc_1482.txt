Low tides occur when the water reaches its lowest level in a day.
Tides keep cycling from high to low and back again.
In most places the water level rises and falls twice a day.
So there are two high tides and two low tides approximately every 24 hours.
Below, you can see the difference between high and low tides ( Figure below ).
This is called the tidal range .

Why Tides Occur
The figure below shows why tides occur ( Figure below ).
The main cause of tides is the pull of the Moon’s gravity on Earth.
The pull is greatest on whatever is closest to the Moon.
Although the gravity pulls the land, only the water can move.
As a result:
Water on the side of Earth facing the Moon is pulled hardest by the Moon’s gravity.
This causes a bulge of water on that side of Earth.
That bulge is a high tide.
Earth itself is pulled harder by the Moon’s gravity than is the ocean on the side of Earth opposite the Moon.
As a result, there is bulge of water on the opposite side of Earth.
This creates another high tide.
