Use the crisscross method to ensure that the final formula is neutral.
Calcium nitrate is composed of a calcium cation and a nitrate anion.
How to write the formula for calcium nitrate
The charge is balanced by the presence of two nitrate ions and one calcium ion.
Parentheses are used around the nitrate ion because more than one of the polyatomic ion is needed.
If only one polyatomic ion is in a formula, parentheses are not used.
As an example, the formula for calcium carbonate is CaCO 3 .
The carbonate ion carries a 2− charge and so exactly balances the 2+ charge of the calcium ion.
There are two polyatomic ions that produce unusual formulas.
The Hg 2 2+ ion is called either the dimercury ion or, preferably, the mercury(I) ion.
When bonded with an anion with a 1− charge, such as chloride, the formula is Hg 2 Cl 2 .
Because the cation consists of two Hg atoms bonded together, this formula is not reduced to HgCl.
Likewise, the peroxide ion, O 2 2- , is also a unit that must stay together in its formulas.
For example, the formula for potassium peroxide is K 2 O 2 .
Ternary compounds are composed of three or more elements.
Ternary compounds are named by stating the cation first, followed by the anion.
Positive and negative charges must balance.
