Eyewitness to Evolution
In the 1970s, biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galápagos Islands.
They wanted to re-study Darwin’s finches.
They spent more than 30 years on the project.
Their efforts paid off.
They were able to observe evolution by natural selection actually taking place.
While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred.
As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat.
Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds.
Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes.
As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought.
Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ).
Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased.
Evolution by natural selection had occurred.

The top graph shows the beak sizes of the entire finch population studied by the Grants in The bottom graph shows the beak sizes of the survivors in 1978.
In just 2 years, beak size increased.
Biogeography is the study of how and why plants and animals live where they do.
It also provides evidence for evolution.
