Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy.
They contain a material such as silicon that absorbs light energy and gives off electrons.
Launch the interactive at the following URL to learn more about solar cells.
Then answer the questions below.
Why does a solar cell have an antireflective coating?
How is the silicon in a solar cell “doped” so it will conduct electricity?
Explain how an electric field is established in the solar cell.
Describe how photons from the sun affect the silicon layers of a solar cell.
What parts of a solar cell conduct electricity into a wire so it can be used for electric devices?
What is voltage?
How is it related to electric current?
How does a chemical cell produce current?
Explain how a solar cell works.
Define resistance and identify the SI unit for resistance.
List factors that affect resistance.
Explain why resistance can be a help or a hindrance.
These athletes are playing rugby, a game that is similar to American football.
The players in red and blue are trying to stop the player in blue and black from running across the field with the ball.
They are resisting his forward motion.
This example of resistance in rugby is a little like resistance in physics.
