In a small population, you may also, by chance, get different allele frequencies than expected in the next generation.
In this way, allele frequencies may drift over time.
There are two special conditions under which genetic drift occurs.
They are called bottleneck effect and founder effect.
Bottleneck effect occurs when a population suddenly gets much smaller.
This might happen because of a natural disaster such as a forest fire.
By chance, allele frequencies of the survivors may be different from those of the original population.
Founder effect occurs when a few individuals start, or found, a new population.
By chance, allele frequencies of the founders may be different from allele frequencies of the population they left.
An example is described in the Figure below .
Founder Effect in the Amish Population.
The Amish population in the U.S. and Canada had a small number of founders.
How has this affected the Amish gene pool?
There are four forces of evolution: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection.
Mutation creates new genetic variation in a gene pool.
Gene flow and genetic drift alter allele frequencies in a gene pool.
