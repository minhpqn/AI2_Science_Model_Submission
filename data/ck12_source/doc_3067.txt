Other machines increase the distance over which the force is applied but decrease the strength of the force.
Still other machines change the direction of the force, with or without also increasing its strength or distance.
Which way a machine works determines its mechanical advantage, as shown in the Table below
Strength of Force
Distance Over which Force is Applied
stays the same (changes direction only)
stays the same
The actual mechanical advantage of a machine reflects the increase or decrease in force achieved by the machine.
It takes into account the force needed to overcome friction.
The actual mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation: \mathrm{Actual\;Mechanical\;Advantage=\frac{Output\;force}{Input\;force}}
The ideal mechanical advantage of a machine reflects the increase or decrease in force there would be without friction.
It is always greater than the actual mechanical advantage because all machines must overcome friction.
The ideal mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation: \mathrm{Ideal\;Mechanical\;Advantage=\frac{Input\;Distance}{Output\;Distance}}
The mechanical advantage of a machine may be greater than, less than, or equal to 1, depending on the type of machine.

Juan uses a lever to lift a rock.
He places the rock on the short arm of the lever and pushes down on the other arm of the lever.
He applies 30 N of force over a distance of 1 m.
The other end of the lever moves in the opposite direction and raises the rock a distance of 0.2 m.
