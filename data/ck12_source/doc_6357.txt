Entropy and Free Energy
List factors that influence the entropy of a system.
List situations that illustrate the concept of entropy.
A jigsaw puzzle is initially very disordered
What will it look like?
When the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle are dumped from the box, the pieces naturally hit the table in a very random pattern.
In order to put the puzzle together, a great deal of work must be done to overcome the natural disorder of the pieces.
The pieces need to be turned right-side up, then sorted by color or edge (some people like to put the border together first).
Then comes the challenge of finding the exact spot of each piece of the puzzle in order to get the final organized picture.
There is a tendency in nature for systems to proceed toward a state of greater disorder or randomness.
Entropy is a measure of the degree of randomness or disorder of a system.
Entropy is an easy concept to understand when thinking about everyday situations.
The entropy of a room that has been recently cleaned and organized is low.
As time goes by, it likely will become more disordered and thus its entropy will increase (see Figure below ).
The natural tendency of a system is for its entropy to increase.
A messy room has more entropy than a neat room
The messy room on the right has more entropy than the highly ordered room on the left.
Chemical reactions also tend to proceed in such a way as to increase the total entropy of the system.
How can you tell if a certain reaction shows an increase or a decrease in entropy?
The molecular state of the reactants and products provide certain clues.
