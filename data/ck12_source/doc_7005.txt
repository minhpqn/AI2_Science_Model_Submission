Make a graph of buoyant force vs. depth, find a best-fit line for the data points, and calculate its slope.
What does this slope physically represent? (That is, what would a greater slope mean?)
With this slope, and the value for the density of water, calculate the area of the circular cup’s bottom and its radius.
Design an experiment using this apparatus to measure the density of an unknown fluid.
String tension (N)
Buoyant force (N)
A submarine is moving directly upwards in the water at constant speed.
The weight of the submarine is 500,000 \;\mathrm{N} .
The submarine’s motors are off.
Draw a sketch of the situation and a free body diagram for the submarine.
What is the magnitude of the buoyant force acting on the submarine?
A glass of water with weight 10 \;\mathrm{N} is sitting on a scale, which reads 10 \;\mathrm{N} .
An antique coin with weight 1 \;\mathrm{N} is placed in the water.
At first, the coin accelerates as it falls with an acceleration of g/2 .
About half-way down the glass, the coin reaches terminal velocity and continues at constant speed.
Eventually, the coin rests on the bottom of the glass.
What was the scale reading when:
The coin had not yet been released into the water?
The coin was first accelerating?
The coin reached terminal velocity?
