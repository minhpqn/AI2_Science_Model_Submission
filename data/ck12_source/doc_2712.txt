As a result, the products are likely to be warmer than the reactants.
Thatâ€™s what happens in the exothermic reaction at the URL below.
Q:
You turn on the hot water faucet, and hot water pours out.
How does the water get hot?
Do you think that an exothermic reaction might be involved?
A:
A hot water heater increases the temperature of water in most homes.
Many hot water heaters burn a fuel such as natural gas.
The burning fuel causes the water to get hot because combustion is an exothermic reaction.
Combustion as an Exothermic Reaction
All combustion reactions are exothermic reactions.
During a combustion reaction, a substance burns as it combines with oxygen.
When substances burn, they usually give off energy as heat and light.
Look at the big bonfire in the Figure below .
The combustion of wood is an exothermic reaction that releases a lot of energy as heat and light.
You can see the light energy the fire is giving off.
If you were standing near the fire, you would also feel its heat.
Wood burning in a bonfire is an exothermic reaction
An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction in which less energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products.
