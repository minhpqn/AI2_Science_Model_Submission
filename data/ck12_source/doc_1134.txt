Earth's Axis of Rotation
Imagine a line passing through the center of Earth.
The line exits the planet at the top and at the bottom.
The point at the top is the North Pole.
The point at the bottom is the South Pole.
This imaginary line is called an axis .
The points are the north and south geographic poles.
The geographic poles are different from the magnetic poles, and they are in different places on the planet.
Earth's axis of rotation is tilted
Earth rotates on an axis, an imaginary line that goes from the North (celestial) Pole to the South (celestial) Pole.
Note that Earth's axis of rotation is tilted.
The axis is not perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic.
This plane is the one that solar system bodies are mostly lined up in.
Earth spins around its axis, just as a top spins around its spindle.
This spinning movement is called rotation .
The axis is Earth's axis of rotation .
Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours.
To an observer looking down at the North Pole, Earth appears to rotate counterclockwise.
From nearly all points on Earth, the Sun appears to move across the sky from east to west each day.
Of course, the Sun is not moving from east to west at all;
