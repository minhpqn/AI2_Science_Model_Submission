DNA polymerase cannot build a strand in the 3' → 5' direction.
Thus, this "lagging” strand is synthesized in short segments known as Okazaki fragments .
On the lagging strand, an enzyme known as primase builds a short RNA primer.
DNA polymerase is then able to use the free 3'-OH group on the RNA primer to make DNA in the 5' → 3' direction.
The RNA fragments are then degraded and new DNA nucleotides are added to fill the gaps where the RNA was present.
Another enzyme, DNA ligase , is then able to attach (ligate) the DNA nucleotides together, completing the synthesis of the lagging strand ( Figure below ).
DNA replication.
The two DNA strands are opened by helicase.
The strands are held open by a single strand of binding proteins, preventing premature reannealing.
Topoisomerase solves the problem caused by tension generated by winding/unwinding of DNA.
This enzyme wraps around DNA and makes a cut permitting the helix to spin and relax.
Once DNA is relaxed, topoisomerase reconnects broken strands.
DNA primase synthesizes a short RNA primer which initiates the Okazaki fragment.
Okazaki fragments are attached by DNA ligase.
Many replication forks develop along a chromosome.
This process continues until the replication forks meet, and the all of the DNA in a chromosome has been copied.
Each new strand that has formed is complementary to the strand used as the template.
Each resulting DNA molecule is identical to the original DNA molecule.
During prophase of mitosis or prophase I of meiosis, these molecules of DNA condense into a chromosome made of two identical "sister" chromatids.
This process ensures that cells that result from cell division have identical sets of genetic material, and that the DNA is an exact copy of the parent cell’s DNA.
