Effectively makes r bigger, thus acceleration goes up and thus final velocity goes up.
Solve problems of rolling objects and of objects that are rolling and sliding.
Students will learn how to solve problems of rolling objects and also of objects that are rolling and sliding.
\tau_{net} = \Sigma \tau_i = I \alpha = F_{Friction} R_{RollingRadius} = \mu F_{normal} R_{RollingRadius}
\text{Static and Kinetic Friction'}\begin{cases}f_s \le \mu_s | F_N| & \text{Opposes potential motion of surfaces in contact}\\\f_k = \mu_k | F_N| & \text{Opposes motion of surfaces in contact}\end{cases}
When an object is rolling without slipping this means that v = r \omega  and  a = r \alpha  .
This is also true in the situation of a rope on a pulley that is rotating the pulley without slipping.
Using this correspondence between linear and angular speed and acceleration is very useful for solving problems, but is only true if there is no slipping.
Also, know that when the object is sliding, kinetic friction is in play.
When it is rolling, then static friction.
Often, an object will start out rolling and sliding (kinetic friction) until it slows enough that it is rolling without sliding (static friction).
One can set up a condition by forcing  v = r \omega  and a = r \alpha  in order to find the point where it stops sliding.
Finally, when this rolling object rolls down the incline, it gains kinetic energy and loses potential energy, just like any object going down an incline.
However, for rolling objects the kinetic energy is split between two forms: rotational and kinetic:
KE_{Rolling Object} = \frac{1}2 m{v}^2 + \frac{1}2 I{\omega}^2
Remember, if the object isn't sliding but perfectly rolling: v = \omega r
You throw a bowling ball of mass m and radius r with an initial speed v_o down a flat bowling lane with a coefficient of kinetic friction \mu_k .
Initially, the ball slides down the lane not rotating at all, but after a time \Delta t , it begins to roll perfectly without sliding.
Find \Delta t in terms of the values given above.
We'll start by drawing an FBD for the bowling ball.
