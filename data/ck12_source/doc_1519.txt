Air is easy to forget about.
We usually can’t see it, taste it, or smell it.
We can only feel it when it moves.
But air is actually made of molecules of many different gases.
It also contains tiny particles of solid matter.
Gases in Air
The figure below shows the main gases in air ( Figure below ).
Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of air.
Argon and carbon dioxide make up much of the rest.
These percentages are the same just about everywhere in the atmosphere.
The composition of the atmosphere
This graph identifies the most common gases in air.
Air also includes water vapor.
The amount of water vapor varies from place to place.
That’s why water vapor isn’t included in the figure above.
It can make up as much as 4% of the air.
Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air.
Humidity varies from place to place.
It also varies in the same place from season to season.
On a summer day in Atlanta, Georgia, humidity is high.
