The human population passed the 7 billion mark in October of 2011, and will pass 8 and 9 billion probably before the middle of the century.
All these people will need resources such as places to live, food to eat, and water to drink, and they will use energy and create waste.
Essentially, human population growth can effect all other causes of extinction.
For example, more people on the Earth means more people contributing to global warming and pollution.
More people also means more clearing of land for agriculture and development.
Recall that development by humans often causes habitats to be destroyed.
This destruction can force species to go extinct, or move somewhere else.
Global climate change is a major cause of extinctions.
Pollution of chemicals, noise, heat, or even light to an environment can be harmful to organisms.
