How does the cell know when to divide?
How does the cell know when to replicate its DNA?
How does the cell know when to proceed into mitosis or cytokinesis?
The answers to these questions have to do with the control of the cell cycle.
But how is the cell cycle controlled or regulated?
Regulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell.
These include the detection and repair of damage to DNA, as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division.
Uncontrolled cell division can be deadly to an organism; its prevention is critical for survival.
Cyclins and Kinases
The cell cycle is controlled by a number of protein-controlled feedback processes.
Two types of proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle are kinases and cyclins .
Cyclins activate kinases by binding to them, specifically they activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) .
Cyclins comprise a group of proteins that are rapidly produced at key stages in the cell cycle.
Once activated by a cyclin, CDK are enzymes that activate or inactivate other target molecules through phosphorylation.
It is this precise regulation of proteins that triggers advancement through the cell cycle.

Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these critical proteins.
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of protein kinases first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle.
