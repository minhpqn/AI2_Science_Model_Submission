Give two examples of intensive properties.
extensive property:
A property that depends on the amount of matter in a sample.
intensive property:
A property of matter that depends only on the type of matter in a sample and not on the amount.
Solid, Liquid, and Gas
Define, solid, liquid, and gas.
Explain differences among these three phases of matter.
Ice, water, and steam are the three phases of water
Why is the state of water different in each picture?
Water can take many forms.
At low temperatures (below 0°C), it is a solid.
When at “normal” temperatures (between 0°C and 100°C), it is a liquid.
While at temperatures above 100°C, water is a gas (steam).
The state the water is in depends upon the temperature.  Each state (solid, liquid, and gas) has its own unique set of physical properties.
Matter and Its States
Matter typically exists in one of three states: solid , liquid , or gas .
The state a given substance exhibits is also a physical property.
Some substances exist as gases at room temperature (oxygen and carbon dioxide), while others, like water and mercury metal, exist as liquids.
Most metals exist as solids at room temperature.
