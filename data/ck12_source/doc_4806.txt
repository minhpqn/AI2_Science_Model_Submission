Where do you get the amino acids needed so your cells can make their own proteins?
If you cannot make the amino acids yourself - and some of them you cannot make - then you must eat them.
Proteins are organic compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and, in some cases, sulfur.
These compounds may many essential functions within the cell (see below).
Proteins are made of smaller units called amino acids .
There are 20 different common amino acids needed to make proteins.
All amino acids have the same basic structure, which is shown in Figure below .
Only the side chain (labeled R in the figure) differs from one amino acid to another.
These side chains can vary in size from just one hydrogen atom in glycine to a large heterocyclic group in tryptophan.
The variable side chain gives each amino acid unique properties.
The side chains can also characterize the amino acid as (1) nonpolar or hydrophobic, (2) neutral (uncharged) but polar, (3) acidic, with a net negative charge, and (4) basic, with a net positive charge at neutral pH.
Proteins can differ from one another in the number and sequence (order) of amino acids.
It is because of the side chains of the amino acids that proteins with different amino acid sequences have different shapes and different chemical properties.
Small proteins can contain just a few hundred amino acids.
Yeast proteins average 466 amino acids.
The largest known proteins are the titins, found in muscle, which are composed from over 27,000 amino acids.
General Structure of Amino Acids.
This model shows the general structure of all amino acids.
Only the side chain, R, varies from one amino acid to another.
For example, in the amino acid glycine, the side chain is simply hydrogen (H).
