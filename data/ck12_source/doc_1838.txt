Caves are one of the types of landforms created by groundwater erosion.
Working slowly over many years, groundwater travels along small cracks.
The water dissolves and carries away the solid rock.
This gradually enlarges the cracks.
Eventually, a cave, like the one pictured in the Figure below , may form.

You can explore a fantastic cave, Kartchner Caverns, in Arizona, by watching this video:
As erosion by groundwater continues, the ceiling of a cave may collapse.
The rock and soil above it sink into the ground.
This forms a sinkhole on the surface.
Some sinkholes are large enough to swallow up a home or several homes in a neighborhood.
Groundwater erodes rock beneath the ground surface.
Limestone is a carbonate and is most easily eroded.
Groundwater dissolves minerals and carries the ions in solution.
Groundwater erosion creates caves and sinkholes.
