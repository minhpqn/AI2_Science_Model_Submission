All other involuntary activities not under conscious control are the responsibility of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) .
Nerves of the ANS are connected to glands and internal organs.
They control basic physical functions such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and sweat production.
The autonomic nervous system also has two subdivisions: the sympathetic division and the parasympathetic division.
You can watch an animation comparing these two subdivisions at this link:
The sympathetic division deals with emergency situations.
It prepares the body for “fight or flight.” Do you get clammy palms or a racing heart when you have to play a solo or give a speech?
Nerves of the sympathetic division control these responses.
The parasympathetic division controls involuntary activities that are not emergencies.
For example, it controls the organs of your digestive system so they can break down the food you eat.
The peripheral nervous system consists of all the nervous tissue that lies outside the central nervous system.
It is connected to the central nervous system by nerves.
The peripheral nervous system has several divisions and subdivisions that transmit nerve impulses between the central nervous system and the rest of the body.
