Proteins are transported through the ER and then throughout the cell are marked with a signal sequence.
This sequence is usually a short peptide of a few amino acids attached to the N-terminal end of the protein.
This short sequence acts as an address "tag," directing the protein to its correct destination in the cell.
At this time, the signal sequence is removed.
These proteins packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination.
cisternae (singular, cisterna ):
Flattened membranous regions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) :
A network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, cisternae, and vesicles; involved in transport of molecules, such as proteins, and the synthesis of proteins and lipids.
rough endoplasmic reticulum :
Endoplasmic reticulum embedded with ribosomes.
smooth endoplasmic reticulum :
Endoplasmic reticulum without embedded ribosomes.
transport vesicle :
A vesicle that is able to move molecules between locations inside the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, cisternae, and vesicles.
The ER is involved in transport of molecules, such as proteins, and the synthesis of proteins and lipids.
The ER can be rough, with embedded ribosomes, or smooth, without ribosomes.
What are the main structural and functional differences between rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum?
