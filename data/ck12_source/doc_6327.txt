Calculate the equilibrium constant at this temperature.
Step 1:
List the known values and plan the problem .
[NO] = 0.0542 M
[O 2 ] = 0.127 M
[NO 2 ] = 15.5 M
The equilibrium expression is first written according to the general form in the text.
The equilibrium values are substituted into the expression and the value calculated.
Step 2:
Solve .
K_{eq}=\frac{\left [\text{NO}_2 \right ]^2}{\left [\text{NO} \right ]^2 \left [\text{O}_2 \right ]}
Substituting in the concentrations at equilibrium:
K_{eq}=\frac{\left ( 15.5\right )^2}{\left (0.0542 \right )^2 \left (0.127\right )}=6.44 \times 10^5
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The equilibrium concentration of the product NO 2 is significantly higher than the concentrations of the reactants NO and O 2 .
As a result, the  K_{eq} value is much larger than 1, an indication that the product is favored at equilibrium.
The equilibrium expression only shows those substances whose concentrations are variable during the reaction.
A pure solid or a pure liquid does not have a concentration that will vary during a reaction.
Therefore, an equilibrium expression omits pure solids and liquids and only shows the concentrations of gases and aqueous solutions.
