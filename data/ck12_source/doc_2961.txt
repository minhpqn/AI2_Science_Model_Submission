Review how to calculate velocity from a position-time graph at the following URL.
Then solve the two problems at the bottom of the Web page.
Be sure to check your answers and read the explanations for the correct solutions.
Describe how to make a position-time graph.
What is the slope of a line graph?
What does the slope of a position-time graph represent?
Can a line on a position-time graph have a negative slope, that is, can it slope downward from left to right?
Why or why not?
In Graph 1 in the Figure above , what is the object’s average velocity?
Distinguish between velocity and speed.
Represent velocity with vector arrows.
Describe objects that have different velocities.
Show how to calculate average velocity when direction is constant.
Ramey and her mom were driving down this highway at 45 miles per hour, which is the speed limit on this road.
As they approached this sign, Ramey’s mom put on the brakes and started to slow down so she could safely maneuver the upcoming curves in the road.
This speed limit sign actually represents two components of motion: speed and direction.
Speed and Direction
Speed tells you only how fast or slow an object is moving.
It doesn’t tell you the direction the object is moving.
The measure of both speed and direction is called velocity .
