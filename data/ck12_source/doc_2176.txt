This means that Mercury hasn’t changed much geologically for billions of years.
It has no plate tectonics.
With only a trace of an atmosphere, it has no weather to wear down the ancient craters.
The surface of Mercury is covered with craters, like Earth’s Moon
The surface of Mercury is covered with craters, like Earth’s Moon.
Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, it is difficult to observe from Earth, even with a telescope.
The Mariner 10 spacecraft did a flyby of Mercury in 1974–1975.
In 2004, the MESSENGER mission left Earth.
On its way to Mercury, it did one flyby of Earth, two of Venus, and three of Mercury.
In March 2011, MESSENGER became the first spacecraft to enter an orbit around Mercury.
To date, MESSENGER has taken over 100,000 images and has revealed many interesting features of the planet's interior.
Short Year, Long Days
Mercury is named for the Roman messenger god.
Mercury was a messenger because he could run extremely fast.
The Greeks gave the planet this name because Mercury moves very quickly in its orbit around the Sun.
Mercury orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
Mercury has a very short year, but it also has very long days.
Mercury rotates slowly on its axis, turning exactly three times for every two times it orbits the Sun.
Therefore, each day on Mercury is 58 Earth days long.
Mercury is very close to the Sun, so it can get very hot.
