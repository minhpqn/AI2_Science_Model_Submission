The Solar System
How well do humans know the solar system?
Humans have been exploring the solar system for centuries.
Mostly we have used telescopes or simply our eyes.
But the Sun, all of the planets, and many dwarf planets, asteroids and comets have been studied more closely.
Spaceships have taken rovers, probes or other technologies to study these bodies.
Sometimes a spacecraft just flies by to take a look.
So while it's very difficult to get humans very far from Earth, our spacecraft have become our eyes.
We know an incredible amount about the solar system compared with even a few decades ago.
This is because of the tremendous spacecraft and the instruments they carry.
In this concept, we will explore a small fraction of what scientists have learned about our solar system.
Describe the basic properties of the Sun.
How can we learn about something as hot as the Sun?
Humans have sent spacecraft up to study our star.
The SOHO spacecraft has been in operation since 1996.
The craft orbits the Sun in step with Earth but closer to it.
SOHO has sent back amazing images.
Onboard instruments have also sent back mountains of data.
The data is mostly about the Sun's outer layers.
Our Sun is a star , a sphere of plasma held together by gravity.
