Diagram of concave mirror
The other type of curved mirror, a convex mirror, is shaped like the outside of a bowl.
Because of its shape, it can gather and reflect light from a wide area.
As you can see in the Figure below , a convex mirror forms only virtual images that are right-side up and smaller than the actual object.
You can see how a convex mirror forms an image in the animation at this URL:

Q:
Convex mirrors are used as side mirrors on cars.
You can see one in the Figure below .
Why is a convex mirror good for this purpose?
A:
Because it gathers light over a wide area, a convex mirror gives the driver a wider view of the area around the vehicle than a plane mirror would.
Car mirrors are convex mirrors
When a mirror reflects light, it forms an image.
An image is a copy of an object formed by reflection (or refraction).
A real image is a true image that forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays actually meet.
A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror and doesnâ€™t really exist.
Most mirrors are plane mirrors that have a flat reflective surface.
A plane mirror forms only virtual, right-side up, and life-sized images.
A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl.
