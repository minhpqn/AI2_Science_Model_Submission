This mudskipper might not seem like a fish.
It's not swimming in a lake or an ocean, and it appears to be using its fins like legs.
Mudskippers can breathe through their skin and burrow in the mud, essentially living on land for a brief amount of time.
These features are not typical of fish, and, yet, mudskippers are still classified as fish.
So what features define a fish?
Characteristics of Fish
What exactly is a fish?
You probably think the answer is obvious.
You may say that a fish is an animal that swims in the ocean or a lake, using fins.
But as we saw with the mudskipper, not all fish spend all their time in water.
So how do scientists define fish?
Some characteristics of fish include:
They are ectothermic , meaning their temperature depends on the temperature of their environment.
Ectothermic animals are cold-blooded in that they cannot raise their body temperature on their own.
This is unlike humans, whose temperature is controlled from inside the body.
They are covered with scales.
They have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins.
They also have a streamlined body that allows them to swim rapidly.
Fish are aquatic vertebrates, meaning they have backbones.
They became a dominant form of sea life and eventually evolved into land vertebrates.
