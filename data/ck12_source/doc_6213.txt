How do these trees and mosses differ?
The trees tower in the sky, while the mosses carpet the forest floor.
Mosses, like the first plants, are restricted to life near the ground because they lack vascular system.
Only with a vascular system can these trees transport sugars, nutrients, and water up and down their tall trunks.
The evolution of the vascular system was a big step in the evolutionary history of plants.
Vascular Seedless Plants
For these plants, the name says it all.
Vascular seedless plants have vascular tissue but do not have seeds.
Remember that vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant.
The development of vascular tissue allowed these plants to grow much taller than nonvascular plants, forming ancient swamp forests.
Most of these large vascular seedless plants are now extinct, but their smaller relatives still remain.
Vascular tissue includes xylem, which transports water from the roots to the rest of the plant; and phloem, which transports sugars and nutrients from the leaves throughout the plant.
Seedless vascular plants include:
Clubmosses are so named because they can look similar to mosses ( Figure below ).
Clubmosses are not true mosses, though, because they have vascular tissue.
The “club” part of the name comes from club-like clusters of sporangia found on the plants.
One type of clubmoss is called the "resurrection plant" because it shrivels and turns brown when it dries out but then quickly turns green when watered again.
Clubmosses can resemble mosses; however, clubmosses have vascular tissue, while mosses do not

Ferns are the most common seedless vascular plants ( Figure below ).
