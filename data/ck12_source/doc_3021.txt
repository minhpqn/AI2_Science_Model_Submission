Action and Reaction
Newton’s third law of motion explains how Jerod starts his skateboard moving.
This law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
This means that forces always act in pairs.
First an action occurs—Jerod pushes against the ground with his foot.
Then a reaction occurs—Jerod moves forward on his skateboard.
The reaction is always equal in strength to the action but in the opposite direction.
Q :
If Jerod pushes against the ground with greater force, how will this affect his forward motion?
A :
His action force will be greater, so the reaction force will be greater as well.
Jerod will be pushed forward with more force, and this will make him go faster and farther.
Equal and Opposite Forces
The forces involved in actions and reactions can be represented with arrows.
The way an arrow points shows the direction of the force, and the size of the arrow represents the strength of the force.
Look at the skateboarders in the Figure below .
In the top row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders push against each other.
This is the action.
In the bottom row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders move apart.
This is the reaction.
