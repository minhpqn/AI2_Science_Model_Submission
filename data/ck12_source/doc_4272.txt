Protostomes and Deuterostomes
Most invertebrates (and higher animals) can be placed in one of two groups based on how they develop as embryos.
The two groups are called protostomes and deuterostomes .
As shown in Figure below , organisms in the two groups have different ways of forming the coelom and mouth, among other differences.
Mollusks, annelids, and arthropods are protostomes.
Echinoderms and chordates are deuterostomes.
This distinction is important.
Why does it matter?
It shows that echinoderms are more closely related to chordates than are the other invertebrate phyla.
This is not apparent based on other, more obvious traits.
Differences between protosomes and deutrostomes
Protostomes vs.
Deuterostomes.
In protostomes such as mollusks, the coelom forms within the mesoderm.
In deuterostomes such as echinoderms, the coelom forms from a pouch of endoderm.
How does the formation of the mouth differ in these two groups of animals?
Eight invertebrate phyla contain most invertebrate species.
