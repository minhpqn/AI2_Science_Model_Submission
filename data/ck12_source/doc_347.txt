Getting enough calcium in your daily diet is important for good bone health.
Vitamin D is unusual since you don't have to rely on your diet alone to get enough of this vitamin.
Your skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight.
Pigments in the skin act like a filter that can prevent the skin from making vitamin D.
As a result, people with darker skin need more time in the sun than people with lighter skin to make the same amount of vitamin D.
You can also get vitamin D from foods.
Fish is naturally rich in vitamin D.
In the United States, vitamin D is added to other foods, including milk, soy milk, and breakfast cereals.
Teenagers are recommended to get 5 micrograms (200 IU) of vitamin D every day.
A 3Â½-ounce portion of cooked salmon provides 360 IU of vitamin D.
A 8-ounce glass of milk is fortified with about 100 IU of vitamin D.
Even though they are very strong, bones can fracture , or break.
Fractures can happen at different places on a bone.
They are usually caused by excess bending stress on the bone.
Bending stress is what causes a pencil to break if you bend it too far.
Soon after a fracture, the body begins to repair the break.
The area becomes swollen and sore.
Within a few days, bone cells travel to the break site and begin to rebuild the bone.
It takes about two to three months before compact and spongy bone form at the break site.
Sometimes the body needs extra help in repairing a broken bone.
