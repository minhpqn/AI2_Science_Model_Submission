Polar Coordinate System
You can also use a polar coordinate system.
Your location is marked by an angle and distance from some reference point.
The angle is usually the angle between your location, the reference point, and a line pointing north.
The distance is given in meters or kilometers.
To find your location or to move from place to place, you need a map, a compass, and some way to measure your distance, such as a range finder.
Suppose you need to go from your location to a marker that is 20°E and 500 m from your current position.
You must do the following:
Use the compass and compass rose on the map to orient your map with north.
Use the compass to find which direction is 20°E.
Walk 500 meters in that direction to reach your destination.
Polar coordinates are used in a sport called orienteering.
People who do orienteering use a compass and a map with polar coordinates.
Participants find their way along a course across wilderness terrain ( Figure below ).
They move to various checkpoints along the course.
The winner is the person who completes the course in the fastest time.

Direction is expressed as north, south, east, or west, or some gradation between them.
A compass can be used to indicate direction.
