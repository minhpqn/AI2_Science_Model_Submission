Specific Heat (J/gÂ°C)
Carbon, graphite (s)
Notice that water has a very high specific heat compared to most other substances.
Water is commonly used as a coolant for machinery because it is able to absorb large quantities of heat (see Table above ).
Coastal climates are much more moderate than inland climates because of the presence of the ocean.
Water in lakes or oceans absorbs heat from the air on hot days and releases it back into the air on cool days.
Water is often used as a coolant for factories because of its high heat capacity
This power plant in West Virginia, like many others, is located next to a large lake so that the water from the lake can be used as a coolant.
Cool water from the lake is pumped into the plant, while warmer water is pumped out of the plant and back into the lake.
Heat capacity and specific heat are defined.
