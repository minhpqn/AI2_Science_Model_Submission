Volcanoes are a vibrant manifestation of plate tectonics processes.
Volcanoes are common along convergent and divergent plate boundaries.
They are also found within lithospheric plates at hotspots.
Wherever mantle is able to melt, volcanoes are likely to be the result.
The Pacific Ocean basin is a good place to look for different types of volcanoes.
The light blue wavy line that goes up the right-center of the diagram is the East Pacific Rise.
The rise is made of volcanoes at a divergent plate boundary.
Trenches due to subduction are on the west and east sides of the basin.
Subduction creates island arcs that are seen in the Western Pacific.
Subduction also creates continental arcs seen along Central and South America.
Hawaii is the line of volcanoes trending southeast-northwest near the center-top of the image ( Figure below ).
The Hawaiian volcanoes are due to a hotspot.

Volcanoes at divergent plate boundaries are in the East Pacific Rise.
Convergent plate boundaries, where there are trenches, have volcanoes.
Hotspot volcanoes are in chains in the middle of the ocean basin.
Volcanoes erupt because mantle rock melts.
This is the first stage in creating a volcano.
How can rock melt?
One way is if the temperature rises.
