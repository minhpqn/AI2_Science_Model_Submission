Describe the different types of erosion.
What are the inorganic materials that make up a soil?
What are the organic materials that make up a soil?
In what environment are there no organic materials in soils?
What soils are nearly all organic?
How are living organisms important to soil?
Describe the factors that affect soil formation: weathering, climate, parent rock, slope, time and biological activity.
How are these two soils different?
What color is the soil on the left?
What color is the soil on the right?
Why do you think they differ so much in color?
Which soil do you think is better for growing things?
See below to find out!
How well soil forms and what type of soil forms depends on several different factors, which are described below.
An animation of how weathering makes soil is found here:
Soil development takes a very long time.
It may take hundreds or even thousands of years to form the fertile upper layer of soil.
Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year.
In poor conditions, it may take thousands of years!
Soil formation requires weathering.
