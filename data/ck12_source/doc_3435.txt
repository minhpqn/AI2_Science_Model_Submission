Your own body is made up of an amazing 100 trillion cells!
But even you—like all other living things—began life as a single cell.
Diatoms and whale sharks are all made of cells
Tiny diatoms and whale sharks are all made of cells.
Diatoms are about 20 µm in diameter and are made up of one cell, whereas whale sharks can measure up to 12 meters in length and are made up of billions of cells.
The Gene Theory
The gene theory is the idea that the characteristics of living organisms are controlled by genes, which are passed from parents to their offspring.
A gene is a segment of DNA that has the instructions to encode a protein.
Genes are located on larger structures, called chromosomes , that are found inside every cell.
Chromosomes, in turn, contain large molecules known as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).
Molecules of DNA are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do.

Homeostasis , which is maintaining a stable internal environment or keeping things constant, is not just a characteristic of living things.
It also applies to nature as a whole.
Consider the concentration of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere.
Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere, and this concentration is fairly constant.
What keeps the concentration of oxygen constant?
The answer is living things.
Most living things need oxygen to survive, and when they breathe, they remove oxygen from the atmosphere.
On the other hand, many living things, including plants, give off oxygen when they make food, and this adds oxygen to the atmosphere.
