From the results of his first set of experiments, Mendel realized that there must be two factors controlling each of the characteristics he studied, with one of the factors being dominant to the other.
He also realized that the two factors separate and go to different gametes and later recombine in the offspring.
This is an example of Mendel’s good luck.
All of the characteristics he studied happened to be inherited in this way.
Mendel also was lucky when he did his second set of experiments.
He happened to pick characteristics that are inherited independently of one another.
We now know that these characteristics are controlled by genes on nonhomologous chromosomes.
What if Mendel had studied characteristics controlled by genes on homologous chromosomes?
Would they be inherited together?
If so, how do you think this would have affected Mendel’s conclusions?
Would he have been able to develop his second law of inheritance?
To better understand how Mendel interpreted his findings and developed his laws of inheritance, you can visit the following link.
It provides an animation in which Mendel explains how he came to understand heredity from his experimental results.
Mendel’s work was rediscovered in 1900.
Soon after that, genes and alleles were discovered.
This allowed Mendel’s laws to be stated in terms of the inheritance of alleles.
The gene for a characteristic may have different versions.
These different versions of a gene are known as alleles.
Alleles for different genes assort independently during meiosis.
The alleles an individual inherits make up the individual’s genotype.
