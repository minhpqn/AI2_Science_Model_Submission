An increasing amount comes from a new method.
Hydraulic fracturing, called fracking , is very much in the news lately.
Fracking makes it easier and quicker to get natural gas from the rock ( Figure below ).
Diagram of fracking natural gas
Fracking delivers natural gas from rock that might not otherwise be obtainable.
With fracking, fluids are pumped through a borehole.
The fluids create fractures in the rock that contains the natural gas.
Chemicals in the fluid prevent the fractures from closing.
The natural gas can then be pumped to the surface.
Consequences of Natural Gas Extraction and Use
Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels.
As a result, it causes less air pollution.
It also produces less carbon dioxide than the other fossil fuels.
Because it burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, natural gas has a good reputation.
Still, natural gas does emit pollutants.
Fracking is being found to be destructive in several ways.
Some of the chemicals in the fracking fluids may be harmful.
Some may cause cancer.
Some may be endocrine disruptors.
Endocrine disruptors interrupt the natural hormones in the bodies of humans and animals.
