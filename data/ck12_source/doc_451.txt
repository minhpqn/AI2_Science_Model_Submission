There is no space for a landfill in your body to contain wastes.
You must be able to expel wastes from your body.
This is the role of the excretory system.
So what happens to your body's wastes?
Obviously, you must get rid of them.
This is the job of the excretory system.
You remove waste as a gas (carbon dioxide), as a liquid (urine and sweat), and as a solid.
Excretion is the process of removing wastes and excess water from the body.
Recall that carbon dioxide travels through the blood and is transferred to the lungs where it is exhaled.
In the large intestine, the remains of food are turned into solid waste for excretion.
How is waste other than carbon dioxide removed from the blood?
That is the role of the kidneys.
Urine is a liquid waste formed by the kidneys as they filter the blood.
If you are getting plenty of fluids, your urine should be almost clear.
But you might have noticed that sometimes your urine is darker than usual.
Do you know why this happens?
Sometimes your body is low on water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine.
Therefore, your urine gets darker than usual.
Your body is striving to maintain homeostasis through the process of excretion.
Urine helps remove excess water, salts, and nitrogen from your body.
