Q:
A common cause of electric hazards and fires is a short circuit.
Do you know what a short circuit is?
A:
As its name suggests, a short circuit is damage that allows electric current to travel through a shorter loop than it should.
To find out how this can occur and why it is dangerous, keep reading.
How a Short Circuit Occurs
Did you ever see an old appliance with a damaged cord, like the old shown in the Figure below ?
A damaged electric cord can cause a severe shock if it allows current to pass from the cord to a person who touches it.
A damaged cord can also cause a short circuit.
A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit.
An electric cord contains two wires: one that carries current from the outlet to the appliance and one that carries current from the appliance back to the outlet.
If the two wires in a damaged cord come into contact with each other, current flows from one wire to the other and bypasses the appliance.
This may cause the wires to overheat and start a fire.
Frayed cords are dangerous
Electric Safety Features
Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into modern electric circuits and devices.
They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets.
You can read about these three safety features in the Figure below .
