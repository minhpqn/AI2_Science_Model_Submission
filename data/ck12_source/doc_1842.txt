The power of the ocean modifies landforms by erosion and deposition.
Landforms modified by both erosion and deposition are seen in this photo.
The cliff is being eroded by incoming waves.
The beach is being created as sand is being deposited.
Wave energy does the work of erosion at the shore.
Waves erode sediments from cliffs and shorelines.
The sediment in ocean water acts like sandpaper.
Over time, they erode the shore.
The bigger the waves are and the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause ( Figure below ).
Waves erode cliffs to form beaches
Waves erode sediment from sea cliffs.
The sediment is then deposited on beaches.
These sandy cliffs are in Greece.
Wave refraction either concentrates wave energy or disperses it.
In quiet water areas, such as bays, wave energy is dispersed.
This allows sand to be deposited.
Land that sticks out into the water is eroded by the strong wave energy.
The wave energy concentrates its power on the wave-cut cliff .
Landforms From Wave Erosion
Erosion by waves can create unique landforms ( Figure below ).
