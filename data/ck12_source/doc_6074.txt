The water could then be cooled to 0째C, at which point continued cooling would freeze the water to ice.
The ice could then be cooled to some point below 0째C.
This could be diagrammed in a cooling curve that would be the reverse of the heating curve.
Summary of State Changes
All of the changes of state that occur between solid, liquid and gas are summarized in the diagram in the figure below.
Freezing is the opposite of melting and both represent the equilibrium between the solid and liquid states.
Evaporation occurs when a liquid turns to a gas.
Condensation is the opposite of vaporization and both represent the equilibrium between the liquid and gas states.
Deposition is the opposite of sublimation and both represent the equilibrium between the solid and gas states.
Diagram illustrating the phase transitions that substances undergo
Solid, liquid, and gas states with the terms for each change of state that occurs between them.
A change of state can be brought about by putting heat into a system or removing it from the system.
The temperature of a system will not change as long as the substance is undergoing a change from solid to liquid or liquid to gas, as well as the reverse.
You can experiment with pressure, temperature and phases using this simulation
Change the temperature, pressure, and substance and record your observations.
What happens when ice reaches 0째C?
What is sublimation?
What happens to steam if it is cooled to 100째C?
condensation:
The process of a gas turning to a liquid.
