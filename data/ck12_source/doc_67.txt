Both of the large sharks may look ferocious, and would probably scare anyone who comes across one in the water, but both species are filter-feeders, and feed on tiny fish and plankton.
The tiny carp species is unique in that it has the appearance of larvae, with a reduced skeleton lacking a cranium, which leaves the brain unprotected by bone.
The fish lives in dark acidic waters, having a pH of 3.
Keep in mind that whales are not fish, they are mammals.

Exceptions to Common Fish Traits
There are exceptions to many of these fish traits.
For example, tuna, swordfish, and some species of shark show some warm-blooded adaptations and are able to raise their body temperature significantly above that of the water around them.
Some species of fish have a slower, more maneuverable swimming style, like eels and rays ( Figure below ).
Body shape and the arrangement of fins are highly variable, and the surface of the skin may be naked, as in moray eels, or covered with scales.
Scales can be of a variety of different types.

Why Fish are Important
How are fish important?
Of course, they are used as food ( Figure below ).
In fact, people all over the world either catch fish in the wild or farm them in much the same way as cattle or chickens.
Farming fish is known as aquaculture .
Fish are also caught for recreation to display in the home or in a public aquarium.
