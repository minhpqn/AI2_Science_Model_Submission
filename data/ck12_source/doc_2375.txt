Volume is expressed in cubed units, such as cm 3 or m 3 .
Q:
A certain derived quantity is expressed in the units kg/m 3 .
Which derived quantity is it?
A:
The derived quantity is density, which is mass (kg) divided by volume (m 3 ).
Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more measurements.
They include area, volume, and density.
The area of a rectangular surface is calculated as its length multiplied by its width.
The volume of a rectangular solid is calculated as the product of its length, width, and height.
The density of an object is calculated as its mass divided by its volume.
A given derived quantity is always expressed in the same type of units.
For example, area is always expressed in squared units, such as cm 2 .
