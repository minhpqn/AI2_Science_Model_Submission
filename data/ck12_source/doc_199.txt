Velocity versus time graph with the area under the line being equal to the area of a triangle
By going back to equation 2, we know that \text{displacement}= \frac{1}{2} at^2 .
Using this equation, we can determine that  the displacement of this object in the first 6 seconds of travel is \text{displacement}= \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(6.0 \ \text{m/s}^2)(6.0 \ \text{s})^2 = 108 \ \text{m}
It is not coincidental that this number is the same as the area of the triangle.
In fact, the area underneath the curve in a velocity versus time graph is always equal to the displacement that occurs during that time interval.
There are three equations we can use when acceleration is constant to relate displacement to two of the other three quantities we use to describe motion – time, velocity, and acceleration:
d = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(v_f + v_i)(t) (Equation 1)
d = v_it + \frac{1}{2} at^2 (Equation 2)
v{_f}^2 = v{_i}^2 + 2ad (Equation 3)
When the initial velocity of the object is zero, these three equations become:
d = \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)(v_f)(t) (Equation 1’)
d = \frac{1}{2} at^2 (Equation 2’)
v{_f}^2 = 2ad (Equation 3’)
The slope of a velocity versus time graph is the acceleration of the object.
The area under the curve of a velocity versus time graph is the displacement that occurs during the given time interval.
