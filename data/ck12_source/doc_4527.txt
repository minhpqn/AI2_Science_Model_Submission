The anterior (front) lobe secretes pituitary hormones.
Several pituitary hormones and their effects are listed in Table below .
Most pituitary hormones control other endocrine glands.
That’s why the pituitary is often called the “master gland” of the endocrine system.
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
Stimulates the cortex of each adrenal gland to secrete its hormones.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
Stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormone.
Growth hormone (GH)
Stimulates body cells to synthesize proteins and grow.
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
Stimulates the ovaries to develop mature eggs; stimulates the testes to produce sperm.
Luteinizing hormone (LH)
Stimulates the ovaries and testes to secrete sex hormones; stimulates the ovaries to release eggs.
Stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk.
Other Endocrine Glands
Other glands of the endocrine system are described below.
You can refer to Figure above to see where they are located.
The thyroid gland is a large gland in the neck.
Thyroid hormones increase the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body.
