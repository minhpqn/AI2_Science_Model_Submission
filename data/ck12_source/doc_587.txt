Some of the vessels come from the mother.
Some come from the fetus.
The placenta is attached to the inside of the mother’s uterus.
The fetus is connected to the placenta by a tube called the umbilical cord .
The cord contains two arteries and a vein.
Substances pass back and forth between the mother’s and fetus’s blood through the placenta and cord.
Oxygen and nutrients pass from the mother to the fetus.
Carbon dioxide passes from the fetus to the mother.
It is important for the mother to eat plenty of nutritious foods during pregnancy.
She must take in enough nutrients for the fetus as well as for herself.
She needs extra calories, proteins, and lipids.
She also needs more vitamins and minerals.
In addition to eating well, the mother must avoid substances that could harm the embryo or fetus.
These include alcohol, illegal drugs, and some medicines.
It is especially important for her to avoid these substances during the first eight weeks after fertilization.
This is when all the major organs are forming.
Exposure to harmful substances during this time could damage the developing body systems.
During childbirth , a baby passes from the uterus, through the vagina, and out of the mother’s body.
Childbirth usually starts when the amniotic sac breaks.
Then, the muscles of the uterus start contracting.
