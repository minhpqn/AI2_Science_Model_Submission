Research in Ecology
Ecology involves many different fields, including geology, soil science, geography, meteorology, genetics, chemistry, and physics.
You can also divide ecology into the study of different organisms, such as animal ecology, plant ecology, insect ecology, and so on.
Ecologists also study biomes.
A biome is a large community of plants and animals that live in the same place.
For example, ecologists can study the biomes as diverse as the Arctic, the tropics, or the desert ( Figure below ).
They may want to know why different species live in different biomes.
They may want to know what would make a particular biome or ecosystem stable.
Can you think of other aspects of a biome or ecosystem that ecologists could study?
The Atacama Desert is an example of a biome

Ecologists do two types of research:
Field studies involve collecting data outside in the natural world.
An ecologist who completes a field study may travel to a tropical rainforest to study, count, and classify all of the insects that live in a certain area.
Laboratory studies involve working inside, usually in a controlled environment.
Sometimes, ecologists collect data from the field, and then they analyze that data in the lab.
Also, they use computer programs to predict what will happen to organisms that live in a specific area.
For example, they may make predictions about what happens to insects in the rainforest after a fire.
Organisms and Environments
All organisms have the ability to grow and reproduce.
