What Is Resistance?
In physics, resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges in an electric current as it travels through matter.
The SI unit for resistance is the ohm.
Resistance occurs because moving electrons in current bump into atoms of matter.
Resistance reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transferred through matter.
Thatâ€™s because some of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to other forms of energy, such as heat.

Q:
In the rugby analogy to resistance in physics, what do the players on each team represent?
A:
The player on the blue and black team represents a moving electron in an electric current.
The players on the red and blue team represent particles of matter through which the current is flowing.
Factors That Affect Resistance
How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature.
All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do.
Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current.
They are called electric insulators.
Materials such as metals have low resistance to electric current.
They are called electric conductors.
A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material.
