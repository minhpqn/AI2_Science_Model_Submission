What causes this toy to move?
The drinking duck is a toy that many kids (and adults) enjoy playing with.

The motion of the duck illustrates a physical principle called vapor pressure.
As the vapor pressure changes, the liquid in the duck moves up and down, causing the duck to move.
When a partially filled container of liquid is sealed with a stopper, some liquid molecules at the surface evaporate into the vapor phase .
However, the vapor molecules cannot escape from the container and so after a certain amount of time, the space above the liquid reaches a point where it cannot hold any more vapor molecules.
Now some of the vapor molecules condense back into a liquid.
The system reaches the point where the rate of evaporation is equal to the rate of condensation (see Figure below ).
This is called a dynamic equilibrium between the liquid and vapor phases.
When the rate of condensation is equal to the rate of evaporation, a dynamic equilibrium is formed
Equilibrium between liquid phase and vapor phase.
A dynamic equilibrium can be illustrated by an equation with a double arrow, meaning that the reaction is occurring in both directions and at the same rate.
\text{H}_2 \text{O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_2 \text{O}(g)
The forward direction represents the evaporation process, while the reverse direction represents the condensation process.
Because they cannot escape the container, the vapor molecules above the surface of the liquid exert a pressure on the walls of the container.
The vapor pressure is a measure of the presure (force per unit area) exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container.
Vapor pressure is a property of a liquid based on the strength of its intermolecular forces.
A liquid with weak intermolecular forces evaporates more easily and has a high vapor pressure.
