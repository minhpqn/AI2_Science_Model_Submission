Explain types of ecological succession and replacement within a community.
Distinguish primary succession from secondary succession.
Explain the role of a pioneer species.
Summarize what is meant by a climax community.
What will happen to this land?
Since this land was clearcut, there is little life left behind.
However, that does not mean that this land will stay barren forever.
First little seedlings will establish themselves, and with time a forest could thrive here once again.
When you see an older forest, itâ€™s easy to picture that the forest has been there forever.
This is not the case.
Ecosystems are "dynamic." This means that ecosystems change over time.
That forest may lie on land that was once covered by an ocean millions of years ago.
Lightning may have sparked a fire in a forest, destroying much of the plant life there.
Or the forest may have been cut down at one point for agricultural use, then abandoned and allowed to re-grow over time.
During the ice ages, glaciers once covered areas that are tropical rainforests today.
Both natural forces and human actions cause ecosystems to change.
If there is a big ecosystem change caused by natural forces or human actions, the plants and animals that live there may be destroyed.
Or they may be forced to leave.
Over time, a new community will develop, and then that community may be replaced by another.
You may see several changes in the plant and animal composition of the community over time.
