If the volume is constant, then V_1 = V_2 and canceling  V out of the equation leaves Gay-Lussac’s law.
The combined gas law shows the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure.
\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}
Work on the problems at the link below:
What is the only thing held constant in a combined gas law problem?
If you want to solve for the volume of a gas  (V_2) and  P_1 is greater than P_2 , would you expect  V_2 to be larger or smaller than V_1 ?
What would be the equation for finding  P_2 given all the other parameters?
combined gas law:
Expresses the relationship between the pressure, volume, and absolute temperature of a fixed amount of gas.
State Avogadro’s Law.
Use this law to perform calculations involving quantities of gases.
Avogadro's Law tells us that putting gas into a tire increases its pressure
How much air do you put into a tire?
A flat tire is not very useful.
It does not cushion the rim of the wheel and creates a very uncomfortable ride.
When air is added to the tire, the pressure increases as more molecules of gas are forced into the rigid tire.
How much air should be put into a tire depends on the pressure rating for that tire.
Too little pressure and the tire will not hold its shape.
Too much pressure and the tire could burst.
You have learned about Avogadro’s hypothesis: equal volumes of any gas at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules.
