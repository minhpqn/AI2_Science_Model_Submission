How do macrophages interact with T-cells?
Where does this interaction occur?
What is the main role of white blood cells?
A fever is a sign of infection.
Why might it be considered a good sign?
Define immune response.
Describe the role of the lymphatic system in the immune response.
List the lymph organs.
Explain the roles of the lymph and lymph vessels.
Describe the two main types of lymphocytes.
Do you still have your tonsils?
Many people have their tonsils removed because they can hold on to germs that cause throat infections.
Although sometimes they can do more harm than good, tonsils are there to help you.
They trap pathogens so that they can be destroyed before they enter farther into your body.
The Lymphatic System and the Immune Response
If pathogens get through the body’s first two lines of defense, a third line of defense takes over.
This third line of defense involves the immune system.
It is called an immune response , and is a specific type of response.
The immune system has a special response for each type of pathogen.
The immune system ( Figure below ) is also part of the lymphatic system—named for lymphocytes , which are the type of white blood cells involved in an immune response.
