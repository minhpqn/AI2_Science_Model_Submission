A 1500 kg car starts at rest and speeds up to 3.0 m/s with a constant acceleration.
What is the car’s gain in kinetic energy?
What power is exerted by the engine?
We define efficiency as the ratio of output energy (in this case kinetic energy) to input energy.
If this car’s efficiency is 0.30, how much input energy was provided by the gasoline?
If 0.00015 gallons were used up in the process, what is the energy content of the gasoline in Joules per gallon?
Compare that energy to the food energy in a gallon of Coke, if a 12-oz can contains 150 Calories (food calories) and one gallon is 128 ounces.

Define mechanical advantage and calculate it for various tools.
Students will learn about mechanical advantage and how to find the mechanical advantage of various tools.
Mechanical Advantage (MA)
MA = \frac{d_1}{d_2} = \frac{F_{out}}{F_{in}}
d1 is the distance of effort and d2 is the distance the object is moved
Mechanical Advantage is the ability to lift or move objects with great force while utilizing only a little force.
The trade-off is that you must operate the smaller input force for a large distance.
This is all seen through the work Equation.
Work equals force times distance.
