Orbital filling diagrams are a way of indicating electron locations in orbitals.
Use the link below to carry out the following exercise:
Select an atom from the list (you will probably want to do lower atomic numbers).
Leave the number set a zero.
Look up the atom on a periodic table and determine the number of electrons present.
Draw the orbital filling diagram for the atom.
Click on the “Calculate” button and compare your answer with the one provided.
State Hund’s rule.

Explain your answer.
Electron filling diagram for a problem
Hund’s rule:
Orbitals of equal energy are each occupied by one electron before any orbital is occupied by a second electron and that each of the single electrons must have the same spin.
orbital filling diagram:
A visual way to represent the arrangement of all the electrons in a particular atom.
Use electron configuration notation to indicate the electron configuration of an atom.
