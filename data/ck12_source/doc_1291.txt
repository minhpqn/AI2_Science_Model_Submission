Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes
What are the consequences of plate tectonics?
Giant plates of lithosphere moving around on a sphere has consequences.
Big consequences.
Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are due to plate interactions.
Mountains originate where plates interact.
If Earth's crust never moved, there would be a lot fewer natural disasters!
Describe the types of geological stress.
Describe the effects of stress on various types of rock under a range of conditions.
When people have too much stress they may break.
What happens if a rock gets too much stress?
Lithospheric plates do a lot of moving on Earth's surface.
Slabs of lithosphere smash into each other.
They move sideways past each other along faults.
Where conditions are right, magma rises through solid rock.
It's no wonder that rocks experience stress!
Rocks respond differently to different types of stress and under different conditions.
Types of Stress
Stress is the force applied to a rock.
Plates experience stress when they collide, move apart, or slide past each other.
