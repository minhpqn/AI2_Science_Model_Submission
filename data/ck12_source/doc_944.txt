The mass lost in mass defect has gone into energy that is called binding energy.
Each nucleus has competing forces.
The repulsive force between the protons tends to blow the nucleus apart and the binding energy tends to hold the nucleus together.
If the repulsion overcomes the average binding energy per nucleon, the nucleus may blow apart or undergo nuclear disintegration.
Early researchers in radioactivity found that the emissions from radioactivity could be classified into three distinct types according to their penetrating power.
They named these three types of radiation alpha (\alpha) , beta (\beta) , and gamma  (\gamma) respectively.
When a nucleus emits an  \alpha particle, the remaining particle will contain two less protons and two less neutrons.
As a result of beta decay, the daughter product will have the same mass number as the parent and an atomic number one greater than the parent.
