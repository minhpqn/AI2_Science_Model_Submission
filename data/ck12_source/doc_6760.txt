Car Collision (CK-12 Simulation)
Two blocks collide on a frictionless surface, as shown above.
Afterwards, they have a combined mass of 10 \;\mathrm{kg} and a speed of 2.5 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
Before the collision, one of the blocks was at rest.
This block had a mass of 8.0 \;\mathrm{kg} .
What was the mass and initial speed of the second block?
In the above picture, the carts are moving on a level, frictionless track.
After the collision all three carts stick together.
Determine the direction and speed of the combined carts after the collision.
The train engine and its four boxcars are coasting at 40 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
The engine train has mass of 5,500 \;\mathrm{kg} and the boxcars have masses, from left to right, of 1,000 \;\mathrm{kg} , 1,500 \;\mathrm{kg} , 2,000 \;\mathrm{kg}, and 3,000 \;\mathrm{kg} . (For this problem, you may neglect the small external forces of friction and air resistance.)
What happens to the speed of the train when it releases the last boxcar? ( Hint:
Think before you blindly calculate. )
If the train can shoot boxcars backwards at 30 \;\mathrm{m/s} relative to the trainâ€™s speed, how many boxcars does the train need to shoot out in order to obtain a speed of 58.75 \;\mathrm{m/s} ?
In Sacramento a 4000 \;\mathrm{kg} SUV is traveling 30 \;\mathrm{m/s} south on Truxel crashes into an empty school bus, 7000 \;\mathrm{kg} traveling east on San Juan.
The collision is perfectly inelastic.
Find the velocity of the wreck just after collision
Find the direction in which the wreck initially moves
Manrico (80.0\;\mathrm{kg}) and Leonora (60.0\;\mathrm{kg}) are figure skaters.
They are moving toward each other.
