Where does the third covalent bond in the CO molecule come from?
Why is the incorrect structure for CO above wrong?
Are coordinate covalent bonds stronger or weaker than regular covalent bonds?
coordinate covalent bond:
A covalent bond in which one of the atoms contributes both of the electrons in the shared pair.
Covalent Bonding in Polyatomic Ions
Draw the Lewis structure of a polyatomic ion when given appropriate information.
Drawing Lewis structures for polyatomic ions is like extending laws to fit a new situation
How do we extend basic principles?
The United States Supreme Court has the unenviable task of deciding what the law is.  This responsibility can be a major challenge when there is no clear principle involved or where there is a new situation not encountered before.  Chemistry faces the same challenge in extending basic concept to fit a new situation.  Drawing of Lewis structures for polyatomic ions uses the same approach, but tweaks the process a little to fit a somewhat different set of circumstances.
Recall that a polyatomic ion is a group of atoms that are covalently bonded together and which carry an overall electrical charge.
The ammonium ion, NH 4 + , is formed when a hydrogen ion (H + ) attaches to the lone pair of an ammonia (NH 3 ) molecule in a coordinate covalent bond.
Structure of the ammonium ion
The ammonium ion.
When drawing the Lewis structure of a polyatomic ion, the charge of the ion is reflected in the number of total valence electrons in the structure.  In the case of the ammonium ion:
& \text{1 N atom} = 5 \ \text{valence electrons} \\& \text{4 H atoms} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \ \text{valence electrons} \\& \text{subtract 1 electron for the 1} + \text{charge of the ion} \\& \text{total of 8 valence electrons in the ion}
It is customary to put the Lewis structure of a polyatomic ion into a large set of brackets, with the charge of the ion as a superscript outside the brackets.
