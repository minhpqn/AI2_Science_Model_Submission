exponent:

leading zero:
The zero to the left of the decimal point which is there to help you see the decimal point more clearly.
SI Length and Volume Units
Describe standard measure of length and volume.
Ships used fathoms to measure depth
How were sailors able to measure the depths of seas?
Back in the days before all the electronic gadgets for measuring depth and locating undersea objects existed, the "fathom" was the unit of measurement for depth.
A rope was knotted every six feet and the end was dropped over the side of the ship.
You could tell how deep the water was by how many knots went under the water before the rope hit bottom.
Today we just turn on an instrument and read the depth to a high level of accuracy.
Length and Volume
Length is the measurement of the extent of something along its greatest dimension.
The SI basic unit of length, or linear measure, is the meter (m).
All measurements of length may be made in meters, though the prefixes listed in various tables will often be more convenient.
The width of a room may be expressed as about 5 meters (m), whereas a large distance, such as the distance between New York City and Chicago, is better expressed as 1150 kilometers (km).
Very small distances can be expressed in units such as the millimeter or the micrometer.
The width of a typical human hair is about 20 micrometers (Î¼m).
Volume is the amount of space occupied by a sample of matter.
