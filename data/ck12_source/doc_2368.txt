Q:
What is the maximum mass this triple beam balance can measure?
A:
The maximum mass it can measure is 610 grams (500 grams + 100 grams + 10 grams).
Q:
What is the smallest mass this triple beam balance can measure?
A:
The smallest mass it can measure is one-tenth (0.1) of a gram.
To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like the one in the Figure below .
This type of balance also makes it easier to make accurate measurements because mass is shown as a digital readout.
In the picture, the balance is being used to measure the mass of a white powder on a plastic weighing tray.
The mass of the tray alone would have to be measured first and then subtracted from the mass of the tray and powder together.
The difference between the two masses is the mass of the powder alone.

Measuring Volume with a Graduated Cylinder
At home, you might measure the volume of a liquid with a measuring cup.
In science, the volume of a liquid might be measured with a graduated cylinder, like the one sketched below.
The cylinder in the picture has a scale in milliliters (mL), with a maximum volume of 100 mL.
Follow these steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of a liquid:
Place the cylinder on a level surface before adding the liquid.
