There are into two major groups of biomes:
Terrestrial biomes , which are land-based, such as deserts and forests.
Aquatic biomes , which are water-based, such as ponds and lakes.
The abiotic factors, such as the amount of rainfall and the temperature, are going to influence other abiotic factors, such as the quality of the soil.
This, in turn, is going to influence the plants that migrate into the ecosystem and thrive in that biome.
Recall that migration is the movement of an organism into or out of a population.
It can also refer to a whole new species moving into a habitat .
The type of plants that live in a biome are going to attract a certain type of animal to that habitat.
It is the interaction of the abiotic and biotic factors that describe a biome and ecosystem.
In aquatic biomes, abiotic factors such as salt, sunlight and temperature play significant roles.
For example, a hot dry biome is going to be completely different from a moderate wet biome.
The soil quality will be different.
Together, these will result in different plants being able to occupy each biome.
Different plants will attract different animals (herbivores) to eat these plants.
These animals, in turn, will attract different (carnivores) animals to eat the herbivores.
So it is the abiotic factors that determine the biotic factors of an ecosystem, and together these define the biome.
A biome is an area with similar climate that includes similar communities of plants and animals.
Climate influences the types of plants and animals that inhabit a specific biome.
