Plants also have a touch response called thigmotropism .
If you have ever seen a morning glory or the tendrils of a pea plant twist around a pole, then you know that plants must be able to sense the pole.
Thigmotropism works much like the other tropisms.
The plant grows straight until it comes in contact with the pole.
Then, the side of the stem that is in contact with the pole grows slower than the opposite side of the stem.
This causes the stem to bend around the pole.
Tropisms are growth toward or away from a stimulus.
Types of tropisms include gravitropism (gravity), phototropism (light), and thigmotropism (touch).

Explain how scientists determined that the signal for phototropism was occurring in the growing tip of a plant?
Explain how scientists determined the signal for phototropism migrated up and down a plant shoot but did not move across the plant shoot?
How did an agar block help scientists determine that some substance moving through the plant was responsible for the phototropic response?
What hormone causes the phototropic response to light?
What is a tropism?
If you tip a plant on its side, what will happen?
Why?
The tendril of a bean meets a metal pole.
What will happen to the tendril?
