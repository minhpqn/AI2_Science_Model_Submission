Proteins are made out of ____________.
What determines the primary structure of a protein?
State two functions of proteins.
What are enzymes?
Describe the role of hemoglobin.
Describe the composition of a nucleic acid.
List the components of a nucleotide.
Identify significant differences between DNA and RNA.
Describe the shape of DNA.
Summarize significant roles of nucleic acids.
You may have heard that something is "encoded in your DNA." What does that mean?
Nucleic acids.
Essentially the "instructions" or "blueprints" of life.
Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the unique blueprints to make the proteins that give you your traits.
Half of these blueprints come from your mother, and half from your father.
Therefore, every person that has ever lived - except for identical twins - has his or her own unique set of blueprints - or instructions - or DNA.
A nucleic acid is an organic compound, such as DNA or RNA, that is built of small units called nucleotides .
Many nucleotides bind together to form a chain called a polynucleotide .
The nucleic acid DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) consists of two polynucleotide chains.
The nucleic acid RNA (ribonucleic acid) consists of just one polynucleotide chain.
