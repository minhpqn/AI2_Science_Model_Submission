The difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the lack of a hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position of deoxyribose.
Though both RNA and DNA contain the nitrogenous bases adenine, guanine and cytosine, RNA contains the nitrogenous base uracil instead of thymine.
Uracil pairs with adenine in RNA, just as thymine pairs with adenine in DNA.
Uracil and thymine have very similar structures; uracil is an unmethylated form of thymine.
The nucleotide sequence of RNA, which is complementary to the DNA sequence, allows RNA to encode genetic information.
RNA though carries the genetic information of just one gene.
Hence, compared to DNA, RNA molecules are relatively small.
A comparison of RNA and DNA is shown in the Table below and Figure below .

A comparison of RNA and DNA.
RNA is single stranded and contains the base uracil, which replaces thymine.
Analysis of RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured.
Unlike DNA, most RNAs, though single-stranded, do form specific secondary structures.
Like proteins, the folded structure of the RNA is specific and gives the RNA functional properties.
Some RNAs contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices.
RNA nucleotides base-pair like DNA nucleotides, however in DNA, this base-pairing is necessary to form the double helix structure uniform to all DNA.
In RNA, the base pairs would be A-U and G-C pairings.
