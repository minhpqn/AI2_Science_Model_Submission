\text{equation} \qquad \text{H}_2 \text{SO}_4(aq)+2\text{NaOH}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4(aq)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
First determine the moles of NaOH in the reaction.
From the mole ratio, calculate the moles of H 2 SO 4 that reacted.
Finally, divide the moles H 2 SO 4 by its volume to get the molarity.
Step 2:
Solve.
& \text{mol NaOH}=M \times L=0.250 \ \text{M} \times 0.03220 \ \text{L}=8.05 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{mol} \ NaOH \\& 8.05 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{mol NaOH} \times \frac{1 \ \text{mol H}_2\text{SO}_4}{2 \ \text{mol NaOH}}=4.03 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{mol H}_2\text{SO}_4 \\& \frac{4.03 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{mol H}_2\text{SO}_4}{0.02660 \ \text{L}}=0.151 \ \text{M H}_2\text{SO}_4
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The volume of H 2 SO 4 required is smaller than the volume of NaOH because of the two hydrogen ions contributed by each molecule.

Cartesian graphs are often used to represent the course of a titration
Where did graphs come from?
The  x-y plot that we know of as a graph was the brainchild of the French mathematician-philosopher Rene Descartes (1596-1650).
His studies in mathematics led him to develop what was known as “Cartesian geometry”, including the idea of our current graphs.
