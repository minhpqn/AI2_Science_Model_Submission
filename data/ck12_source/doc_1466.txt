The organisms are injected into the contaminated region.
They consume the pollutant.
Bioremediation is short for biological remediation.
Chemical remediation can also treat water in the aquifer.
A chemical is pumped into the aquifer.
The chemical destroys the contaminant.
It is much more difficult and expensive to remove the water from the aquifer and then treat it.
The water is pumped to the surface.
It is then cleansed using chemical or biological methods.
It is re-injected into the aquifer.
The contaminated rock and soil must be dug up and the pollutant destroyed.
Then it is returned to the ground.
This is done only in extreme cases.
To clean groundwater: remove the pollutant source, monitor the pollutant, and perform remediation.
Scientists test the water in many wells to see where the contaminant is.
They do this to tell where the contaminant is.
Over time they can tell which direction the contaminant is moving.
Cleaning groundwater in an aquifer requires bioremediation or chemical remediation.
Bioremediation uses microorganisms to consume a pollutant.
Chemical remediation destroys the contaminant.
