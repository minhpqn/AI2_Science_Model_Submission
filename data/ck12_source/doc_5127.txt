cytokinesis :
Division of the cytoplasm, forming two daughter cells.
DNA replication :
The process of copying DNA prior to cell division (eukaryotes) or reproduction (prokaryotes).
haploid :
The state of a cell containing one set of chromosomes; in human gametes, one set is 23 chromosomes, n .
meiosis :
A type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes; forms gametes.
mitosis :
The division of the nucleus into two genetically identical nuclei.

Cell division is part of the life cycle of virtually all cells.
Cell division is the process in which one cell divides to form two new cells.
