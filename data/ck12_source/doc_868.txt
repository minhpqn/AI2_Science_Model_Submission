Pollution can also cause many human health problems, and it can also cause death.
Air pollution can be found both outdoors and indoors.
Outdoor air pollution is made of chemical particles.
When smoke or other pollutants enter the air, the particles found in the pollution mix with the air.
Air is polluted when it contains many large toxic particles.
Outdoor air pollution changes the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.
Primary pollutants are added directly to the atmosphere.
Fires add primary pollutants to the air.
Particles released from the fire directly enter the air and cause pollution ( Figure below ).
Burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is a major source of primary pollutants ( Figure below ).
Secondary pollutants are formed when primary pollutants interact with sunlight, air, or each other.
They do not directly cause pollution.
However, when they interact with other parts of the air, they do cause pollution.
For example, ozone is created when some pollutants interact with sunlight.
High levels of ozone in the atmosphere can cause problems for humans.
Wildfires generate particles that contribute to air pollution
Wildfires, either natural or human-caused, release particles into the air, one of the many causes of air pollution.
A major source of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels in factories, power plants, and motor vehicles
