One problem is that only a tiny fraction of Earth’s water is fresh, liquid water that people can use.
More than 97 percent of Earth’s water is salt water in the oceans.
Just 3% is freshwater.
Most of the freshwater is frozen in ice sheets, icebergs, and glaciers ( Figure below ).
Glaciers store a lot of frozen freshwater
This glacier in Alaska stores a lot of frozen freshwater.
Rainfall and the Water Supply
Rainfall varies around the globe.
About 40% of the land gets very little rain.
About the same percentage of the world’s people don’t have enough water.
You can compare global rainfall with the worldwide freshwater supply at the two URLs below.
Drier climates generally have less water for people to use.
In some places, people may have less water available to them for an entire year than many Americans use in a single day!
How much water is there where you live?
Wealth and the Water Supply
Richer nations can drill deep wells, build large dams, or supply people with water in other ways.
In these countries, just about everyone has access to clean running water in their homes, and water is cheap and easy to get.
It’s no surprise that people in these countries use the most water.
In poorer nations, there is little money to develop water supplies.
Therefore, people get their water where they can.
