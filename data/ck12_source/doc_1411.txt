Flowing along the bottom of the ocean?
Up high in a thundercloud?
Maybe a water molecule that you drink today once quenched the thirst of a dinosaur.
It's all entirely possible.
The Water Cycle
The water cycle ( Figure below ) is the movement of water through the oceans, atmosphere, land, and living things.
The water cycle is powered by energy from the Sun.
Diagram of the water cycle
The water cycle has no beginning or end.
Water just keeps moving along.
Water keeps cycling.
The water cycle repeats over and over again.
Each water molecule has probably been around for billions of years.
That’s because Earth’s water is constantly recycled.
Processes in the Water Cycle
Water keeps changing state as it goes through the water cycle.
This means that it can be a solid, liquid, or gas.
How does water change state?
How does it keep moving through the cycle?
As seen above ( Figure above ), several processes are involved.
