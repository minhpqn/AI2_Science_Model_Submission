In this system, each organism receives a two-part name in which the first word is the genus (a group of species), and the second word refers to one species in that genus.
For example, a coyote's species name is Canis latrans .
Latrans is the species and Canis is the genus, a larger group that includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals.
Here is another example: the red maple, Acer rubra , and the sugar maple, Acer saccharum , are both in the same genus and they look similar ( Figure below ).
Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientific name is in italics.
Tigers (Panthera tigris) and lions (Panthera leo)  have the same genus name, but are obviously different species.
The names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called Latin.
Leaves from the green and red maple tree, and a maple seed
These leaves are from two different species of trees in the Acer , or maple, genus.
The green leaf ( far left ) is from the sugar maple, and the red leaf ( center ) are from the red maple.
One of the characteristics of the maple genus is winged seeds ( far right ).
Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since Linnaeus.
The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category ( Figure below ).
All organisms can be classified into one of three domains , the least specific grouping.
The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
The Kingdom is the next category after the Domain.
All life is divided among six kingdoms:
Kingdom Bacteria, Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista, Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia.
Diagram of the classification categories for organisms
This diagram illustrates the classification categories for organisms, with the broadest category (kingdom) at the bottom, and the most specific category (species) at the top.
