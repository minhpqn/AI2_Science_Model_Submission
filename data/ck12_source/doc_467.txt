What carries these signals?
What are the main organs of the nervous system?
Nerve Cells and Nerve Impulses
Define neuron and synapse.
Describe neuron structure.
Explain the role of the dendrites and axon.
Distinguish sensory neurons from motor neurons.
Summarize what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon.
What do nerve cells look like?
Note that like most other cells, these nerve cells have a nucleus.
They also have other organelles.
However, the long, threadlike extensions of the nerve cells are unique.
This is where the nerve impulses are transmitted.
Neurons and Nerve Impulses
The nervous system is made up of nerves.
A nerve is a bundle of nerve cells.
A nerve cell that carries messages is called a neuron ( Figure below ).
The messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses .
Nerve impulses can travel very quickly because they are electrical impulses.
Think about flipping on a light switch when you enter a room.
