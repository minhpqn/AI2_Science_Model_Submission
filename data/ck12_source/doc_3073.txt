The stairs that wrap around the outside wall of the chimney make up the inclined plane.
Together with the chimney, they represent a machine called a screw.
What Is a Screw
A screw is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane wrapped around a central cylinder.
No doubt you are familiar with screws like the wood screw in the left-hand side of the Figure below .
The cap of the bottle pictured on the right is another example of a screw.
Screws move objects to a greater depth (or higher elevation) by increasing the force applied to the screw.
Many screws are used to hold things together, such as two pieces of wood or a screw cap and bottle.
When you use a screw, you apply force to turn the inclined plane.
The screw, in turn, applies greater force to the object, such as the wood or bottle top.
You can watch an animation of a turning screw at the following URL.

Q :
Can you identify the inclined plane in each example of a screw pictured in the Figure above ?
A :
The inclined plane of the screw on the left consists of the ridges, or threads, that wrap around the central cylinder of the screw.
The inclined plane of the cap on the right consists of the ridges that wrap around the inner sides of the cap.
Mechanical Advantage of a Screw
The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine.
