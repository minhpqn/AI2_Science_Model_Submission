That’s because doing science typically involves making many measurements.
For example, if you do lab exercises in science, you might measure an object’s length or mass, or you might find the volume of a liquid.
Scientists use sensitive measuring devices to make measurements such as these.
The measurements are usually made using SI units of measurement.
Measuring Length with a Metric Ruler
You’ve probably been using a ruler to measure length since you were in elementary school.
But you may have made most of the measurements in English units of length, such as inches and feet.
In science, length is most often measured in SI units, such as millimeters and centimeters.
Many rulers have both types of units, one on each edge.
The ruler pictured below has only SI units.
It is shown here bigger than it really is so it’s easier to see the small lines, which measure millimeters.
The large lines and numbers stand for centimeters.
Count the number of small lines from the left end of the ruler (0.0).
You should count 10 lines because there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter.
Q:
What is the length in millimeters of the red line above the metric ruler?
A:
The length of the red line is 32 mm.
Q:
What is the length of the red line in centimeters?
