The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the better the atmosphere can trap heat.
In other words, an increase in greenhouse gases leads to greater greenhouse effect.
The result is increased global warming.
Pictured below is the increase in carbon dioxide since 1960 ( Figure below ).

How much more carbon dioxide was in the air in 2010 than in 1960?
Burning forests also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Other human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
For example, growing rice and raising livestock both produce methane.
Effects of Global Warming
There are already many effects of global warming being seen.
As Earth has gotten warmer, sea ice has melted.
This has raised the level of water in the oceans ( Figure below ).
Graph showing the sea level has risen 9 inches since 1870
The overall trend in sea level since 1870; it has risen about 9 inches.
The extent of Arctic sea ice in summer has been decreasing rapidly.
The ice pictured below is the sea ice minimum in 2011 ( Figure below ).
The yellow line is the median minimum ice extent for 1979â€“2000.
Drawing of the Arctic sea ice minimum for 2011
The sea ice minimum for 2011 was the second lowest on record.
