\hbar is Planck’s constant divided by 2 \pi
\psi \ (r, t)  is the wave function
m  is the mass of the particle
\nabla ^2 is the Laplacian operator, \frac{\partial ^2}{ \partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial ^2}{ \partial y^2}+ \frac{\partial ^2}{ \partial z^2} (these refer to partial second derivatives)
V(r, t)  is the potential energy influencing the particle
It should be quite clear that without years of high level mathematics, just seeing the equation is no value at all.
Without understanding the math, the equation makes no sense.
The stable energy levels for an electron in an electron cloud are those that have integer values in three positions in the equation.
Schrodinger found that having integer values in these three places in the equation produced a wave function that described a standing wave.
These three integers are called quantum numbers and are represented by the letters n , l , and m .
Solutions to Schrödinger’s equation involve four special numbers called quantum numbers . (Three of the numbers, n , l , and m , come from Schrödinger’s equation, and the fourth one comes from an extension of the theory).
These four numbers completely describe the energy of an electron.
Each electron has exactly four quantum numbers, and no two electrons have the same four numbers.
The statement that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers is known as the Pauli exclusion principle .
The principal quantum number, n , is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, \ldots n) that indicates the main energy level of an electron within an atom.
According to quantum mechanics, every principal energy level has one or more sub-levels within it.
The number of sub-levels in a given energy level is equal to the number assigned to that energy level.
That is, principal energy level 1 will have 1 sub-level, principal energy level 2 will have two sub-levels, principal energy level 3 will have three sub-levels, and so on.
In any energy level, the maximum number of electrons possible is 2n^2 .
Therefore, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the first energy level is 2 (2 \times 1^2) .
