Illustration of a neuron
The structure of a neuron allows it to rapidly transmit nerve impulses to other cells.

The axon of many neurons has an outer layer called a myelin sheath (see Figure above ).
Myelin is a lipid produced by a type of a glial cell known as a Schwann cell .
The myelin sheath acts like a layer of insulation, similar to the plastic that encases an electrical cord.
Regularly spaced nodes, or gaps, in the myelin sheath allow nerve impulses to skip along the axon very rapidly.
Types of Neurons
Neurons are classified based on the direction in which they carry nerve impulses.
Sensory neurons carry nerve impulses from tissues and organs to the spinal cord and brain.
Motor neurons carry nerve impulses from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands (see Figure below ).
Interneurons carry nerve impulses back and forth between sensory and motor neurons.
Motor neuron axon
This axon is part of a motor neuron.
It transmits nerve impulses to a skeletal muscle, causing the muscle to contract.
Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system.
They consist of a cell body, dendrites, and axon.
Neurons transmit nerve impulses to other cells.
Types of neurons include sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons.
