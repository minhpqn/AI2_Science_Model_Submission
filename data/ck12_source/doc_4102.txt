However, they do use them to move in the water.
The theory of evolution suggests that penguins evolved to use their wings for a different purpose.
A whale’s pelvic bones, which were once attached to legs, are also vestigial structures.
Whales are descended from land-dwelling ancestors that had legs.
Homologous structures are structures that have a common function and suggest common ancestry.
For example, homologous structures include the limbs of mammals, such as bats, lions, whales, and humans, which all have a common ancestor.
Different mammals may use their limbs for walking, running, swimming or flying.
The method the mammal uses to move is considered a common function.
A mole has vestigial eyes
Moles live underground where they do not need eyes to find their way around.
This mole’s eyes are covered by skin.
Body parts that do not serve their original function are vestigial structures.
Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology , the study of how organisms develop.
An embryo is an animal or plant in its earliest stages of development.
This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born or hatched.
Centuries ago, people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances.
The embryos of some species are even difficult to tell apart.
Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance until they develop further.
Some unexpected traits can appear in animal embryos.
For example, human embryos have gill slits just like fish!
