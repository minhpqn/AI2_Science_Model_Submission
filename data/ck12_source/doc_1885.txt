Fossils are preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past.
Most preserved remains are hard parts, such as teeth, bones, or shells.
Hard parts are less likely to be destroyed before they can become fossils.
Even so, a very tiny percentage of living things become fossils.
These types of fossils are called body fossils ( Figure below , Figure below , and Figure below ).

Preserved traces can include footprints, burrows, or even wastes.
Examples of these types of fossils, called trace fossils are picture below ( Figure below and Figure below ).

Fossils are the remains or traces of living organisms.
Body fossils are usually hard parts, such as bones, teeth, and shells.
Trace fossils are the traces of organisms, not parts of them.
