(a):
To find the total capacitance, we'll us the equation given above for capacitors in parallel.
C_{total}&=C_1+C_2\\C_{total}&=100\:\mu\text{F} + 60\:\mu\text{F}\\C_{total}&=160\:\mu\text{F}\\
(b):
Now, since the voltage across capacitors in parallel is equal, we can find the charge on C_2 .
Q_2&=C_2V\\Q_2&=60\:\mu\text{F} * 10\:\text{V}\\Q_2&=600\:\mu\text{C}\\

Given a capacitor with 1\;\mathrm{cm} between the plates a field of 20,000\;\mathrm{N/C} is established between the plates.
What is the voltage across the capacitor?
If the charge on the plates is 1 \mu \mathrm{C} , what is the capacitance of the capacitor?
If two identical capacitors of this capacitance are connected in series what it the total capacitance?
Consider the capacitor connected in the following circuit at point B with two switches S and T , a 20 \Omega resistor and a 120\;\mathrm{V} power source:
