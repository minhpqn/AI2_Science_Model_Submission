Chickens are probably the oldest kinds of poultry.
Chickens were domesticated in Asia at least 3,000 years ago.
Since then, farmers have developed other poultry, including ducks, geese, guineafowl, pheasants, and turkeys.
Around the world, people consume all these birds, and even more exotic birds, like ostriches.
Today, chickens rank as the most widely raised poultry by far.
Farmers throughout the world produce hundreds of millions of chickens annually for meat and eggs.
Ducks and turkeys rank second and third in production worldwide.
Ducks are raised for both meat and eggs.
Turkeys are raised mainly for meat.

Birds and Humans
In agriculture, humans harvest bird droppings for use as fertilizer.
These droppings have a high content of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium, three nutrients essential for plant growth.
Chickens are also used as an early warning system of human diseases, such as West Nile virus.
Mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus, bite young chickens and other birds, and infect them with the virus.
When chickens or other birds become infected, humans may also become infected in the near future.
Birds have important cultural relationships with humans.
Birds are common pets in the Western world.
Common bird pets include canaries, parrots, finches, and parakeets.
Sometimes, people act cooperatively with birds.
