Microscopes in Biology - Advanced
Outline the importance of microscopes in the discovery of cells.
Describe contemporary microscopes that are used for biological research.
How do you see something that is too small to be seen by a light microscope?
Use an electron microscope.
This instrument has a resolution many times greater than a light microscope, and can be used to see the details on the outside of a cell.
Some electron microscopes can also be used to see the details inside a cell.
Hooke’s and Leeuwenhoek’s studies and observations filled people with wonder because their studies were of life forms that were everywhere, but too small to see with the naked eye.
Just think how amazed you would be if you were to read about the first accounts of a newly discovered microorganism from the moon or Mars.
Your first thought might be "Things can live there?!" which was probably the first thought of the people who read Hooke’s and Leeuwenhoek’s accounts.
