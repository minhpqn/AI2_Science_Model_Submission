Can You Hear It?
The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second.
Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound .
Infrasound is too low-pitched for humans to hear.
Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound .
Ultrasound is too high-pitched for humans to hear.
Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range.
For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz.
You may have seen special whistles that dogs—but not people—can hear.
The whistles produce sounds with frequencies too high for the human ear to detect.
Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds.
Bats, like the one pictured in the Figure below , can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz!
Bats can detect sounds with very high frequencies
Q:
Bats use ultrasound to navigate in the dark.
Can you explain how?
A:
Bats send out ultrasound waves, which reflect back from objects ahead of them.
They sense the reflected sound waves and use the information to detect objects they can’t see in the dark.
