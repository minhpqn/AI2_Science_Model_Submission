A chemical compound may be very different from the substances that combine to form it.
For example, the element chlorine (Cl) is a poisonous gas, but when it combines with sodium (Na) to form sodium chloride (NaCl), it is no longer toxic.
You may even eat it on your food.
Sodium chloride is just table salt.
What process changes a toxic chemical like chlorine into a much different substance like table salt?
A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into other chemical substances.
The substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants .
The substances that form as a result of a chemical reaction are called products .
During the reaction, the reactants are used up to create the products.
For example, when methane burns in oxygen, it releases carbon dioxide and water.
In this reaction, the reactants are methane (CH 4 ) and oxygen (O 2 ), and the products are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O).
A chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation.
Using the same example, the burning of methane gas can be represented by the equation:
CH 4 + 2 O 2 â†’ CO 2 + 2 H 2 O.
The arrow in a chemical equation separates the reactants from the products and shows the direction in which the reaction occurs.
If the reaction could also occur in the opposite direction, then two arrows, one pointing in each direction, or one arrow pointing in both directions, would be used.
On each side of the arrow, a mixture of chemicals is indicated by the chemical symbols joined by a plus sign (+).
The numbers preceding some of the chemical symbols (such as 2 O 2 ) indicate how many molecules of the chemicals are involved in the reaction. (If there is no number in front of a chemical symbol, it means that just one molecule is involved.)
In a chemical reaction, the quantity of each element does not change.
There is the same amount of each element at the end of the reaction as there was at the beginning.
