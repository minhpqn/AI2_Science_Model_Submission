The sign of  q for an endothermic process is positive because the system is gaining heat.
A chemical reaction or physical change is exothermic if heat is released by the system into the surroundings.
Because the surroundings is gaining heat from the system, the temperature of the surroundings increases.
The sign of  q for an exothermic process is negative because the system is losing heat.
Endothermic reactions absorb heat, while exothermic reactions release heat
(A) Endothermic reaction. (B) Exothermic reaction.
Units of Heat
Heat flow is measured in one of two common units: the calorie and the joule.
The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy.  The calorie is familiar because it is commonly used when referring to the amount of energy contained within food.
A calorie (cal) is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C.
For example, raising the temperature of 100 g of water from 20°C to 22°C would require 100 × 2 = 200 cal.
Calories contained within food are actually kilocalories (kcal).
In other words, if a certain snack contains 85 food calories, it actually contains 85 kcal or 85,000 cal.
In order to make the distinction, the dietary calorie is written with a capital C.
1 \ \text{kilocalorie}=1 \ \text{Calorie} = 1000 \ \text{calories}
To say that the snack “contains” 85 Calories means that 85 kcal of energy are released when that snack is processed by your body.
Heat changes in chemical reactions are typically measured in joules rather than calories.
The conversion between a joule and a calorie is shown below.
1 \text{ J} = 0.2390 \text{ cal or 1 cal} = 4.184 \text{ J}
We can calculate the amount of heat released in kilojoules when a 400.
