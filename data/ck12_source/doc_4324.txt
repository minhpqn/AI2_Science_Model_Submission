Members of the subphylum Urochordata are tunicates (also called sea squirts).
Members of the subphylum Cephalochordata are lancelets .
Both tunicates and lancelets are small and primitive.
They are probably similar to the earliest chordates that evolved more than 500 million years ago.
There are about 3,000 living species of tunicates (see Figure below ).
They inhabit shallow marine waters.
Larval tunicates are free-swimming.
They have all four defining chordate traits (see the "Chordates" concept).
Adult tunicates are sessile.
They no longer have a notochord or post-anal tail.
Tunicates (Urochordata) are one of two subphyla of invertebrate chordates
Tunicates (Urochordata).
Tunicates are one of two subphyla of invertebrate chordates.
Adult tunicates are barrel-shaped.
They have two openings that siphon water into and out of the body.
The flow of water provides food for filter feeding.
Tunicates reproduce sexually.
Each individual produces both male and female gametes.
However, they avoid self-fertilization.
Tunicates can also reproduce asexually by budding.
