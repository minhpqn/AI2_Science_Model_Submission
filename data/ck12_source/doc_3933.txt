Mexico's population pyramid is typical of Stage 3 population
Mexico’s 1998 population pyramid is typical of Stage 3 population.
How can you tell that the birth rate has started to fall?
Most developed nations have entered Stage 4.
Sweden is an example (see Figure below ).
The birth rate has been low for many years in Sweden.
Therefore, the rate of population growth is near zero.
Sweden's population pyramid is typical of Stage 4 population
Sweden’s 1998 population pyramid shows a population in Stage 4.
In some countries, birth rates have fallen even lower than death rates.
As result, their population growth rates are negative.
In other words, the populations are shrinking in size.
These populations have top-heavy population pyramids, like the one for Italy shown in Figure below .
This is a new stage of the demographic transition, referred to as Stage 5.
You might think that a negative growth rate would be a good thing.
In fact, it may cause problems.
For example, growth-dependent industries decline.
Supporting the large aging population is also a burden for the shrinking younger population of workers.

This 1998 population pyramid for Italy represents a Stage 5 population.
