Their rhizoids are very fine, they lack stems, and they are generally less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) tall.
They often grow in colonies that carpet the ground.
Hornworts are minute nonvascular plants, similar in size to liverworts.
They also have very fine rhizoids and lack stems.
Their sporophytes are long and pointed, like tiny horns.
They rise several centimeters above the gametophytes of the plant.
Mosses are larger nonvascular plants that have coarser, multicellular rhizoids that are more like roots.
They also have tiny, photosynthetic structures similar to leaves that encircle a central stem-like structure.
Mosses grow in dense clumps, which help them retain moisture.
Various bryophytes: liverworts, hornworts, mosses
Liverworts, hornworts, and mosses are modern bryophytes.
Liverworts are named for the liver-shaped leaves of some species.
Hornworts are named for their horn-like sporophytes.
Nonvascular plants are called bryophytes.
Nonvascular plants include liverworts, hornworts, and mosses.
They lack roots, stems, and leaves.
Nonvascular plants are low-growing, reproduce with spores, and need a moist habitat.
