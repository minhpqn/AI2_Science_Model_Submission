Latin is an interesting and useful language, even if you don’t want to read Julius Caesar’s writings.
A knowledge of Latin helps us understand our own language better.
Take the word “colligative.” Where did that come from?
If you know a little Latin, you know that it comes from two Latin words meaning “to tie together.” This helps you better understand some of the science terminology we use every day.
Vapor Pressure Lowering
A colligative property is a property of a solution that depends only on the number of solute particles dissolved in the solution and not on their identity.
Recall that the vapor pressure of a liquid is determined by how easily its molecules are able to escape the surface of the liquid and enter the gaseous phase.
When a liquid evaporates easily, it will have a relatively large number of its molecules in the gas phase and thus will have a high vapor pressure.
Liquids that do not evaporate easily have a lower vapor pressure.
The Figure below shows the surface of a pure solvent compared to a solution.
In the picture on the left, the surface is entirely occupied by liquid molecules, some of which will evaporate and form a vapor pressure.
On the right, a nonvolatile solute has been dissolved into the solvent.
Nonvolatile means that the solute itself has little tendency to evaporate.
Because some of the surface is now occupied by solute particles, there is less room for solvent molecules.
This results in less solvent being able to evaporate.
The addition of a nonvolatile solute results in a lowering of the vapor pressure of the solvent.
The vapor pressure of a mixture is lower than the pure substance
The solution on the right left has had some of its solvent particles replaced by solute particles.
Since the solute particles do not evaporate, the vapor pressure of the solution is lower than that of the pure solvent.
The lowering of the vapor pressure depends on the number of solute particles that have been dissolved.
