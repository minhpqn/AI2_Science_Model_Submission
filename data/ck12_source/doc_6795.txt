Guidance In these types of problems it is very important to realize where the application of the force is acting.
Remember that Torque is equal to the Force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis.
So if the CM is the rotation axis then there is not torque from gravity, as the distance from the rotation axis is zero.
Also, in these types of problems, make sure to use Newton's laws in the linear form (i.e.  \Sigma F = ma  ) and also in the rotation form (i.e.  \Sigma \tau_i = I \alpha ).
Then you can substitute in for one of the unknowns and solve for the other.
A wooden disk of mass m and radius r has a string of negligible mass is wrapped around it.
If the the disk is allowed to fall and the string is held so that it unravels without sliding as the disk is falling, what will be the wooden disk's acceleration?
First we'll draw a free body diagram for the situation.
In the diagram below the force of gravity and the tension from the string have been labeled and are drawn from they points they are acting.
Let's start by applying Newton's second law to this object and we'll let the positive direction be downward.
As you can see, we have two unknowns in this equation( T and a ), so we're going to use Newton's second law for rotation as our second equation and solve for T .
The rotation axis is at the cm of the cylinder, thus there is no torque from gravity.
Now we will substitute in values for I and \alpha .
In order to calculate the moment of inertia of the wooden disk, we use the known formula for a disk being rotated about it's center.
T&=\frac{\frac{1}{2}mr^2\alpha}{r} && \text{substituting for } I\\\T&=\frac{1}{2}mr^2\frac{a}{r}\frac{1}{r} && \text{substituting for } \alpha \text{ in terms of } a\\\T&=\frac{1}{2}ma && \text{simplifying the equation.}\\\
We can now plug this back into our original Newton's second law equation from the first step.
mg-T&=ma && \text{start with the equation from we derived in the first step}\\\mg-\frac{1}{2}ma&=ma && \text{substitute for T}\\\a&=\frac{2}{3}g && \text{simplifying and solving for a}\\\
