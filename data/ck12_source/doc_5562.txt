Panning for gold
How did goldminers search for gold?
Beginning in the late 1840s, thousands of prospectors rushed to California to search for gold.
One of the approaches taken to isolate the gold from the soil was called “panning.” Dirt would be placed in the pan and covered with water.
After thorough mixing, the pan is gently swirled to remove dissolved material while the heavier gold settles to the bottom of the pan.
The gold is then separated from the mixture of soil and water.
Separation of Mixtures
Not everyone is out searching for gold (and not many of those searchers is going to get much gold, either).
In a chemical reaction, it is important to isolate the component(s) of interest from all the other materials so they can be further characterized.
Studies of biochemical systems, environmental analysis, pharmaceutical research – these and many other areas of research require reliable separation methods.
Here are a number of common separation techniques:
