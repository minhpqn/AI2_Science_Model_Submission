The Gastrointestinal Tract
The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a long tube that connects the mouth with the anus.
It is more than 9 meters (30 feet) long in adults and includes the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines.
Food enters the mouth, passes through the other organs of the GI tract, and then leaves the body through the anus.

The organs of the GI tract are lined with mucous membranes that secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients.
The organs are also covered by layers of muscle that enable peristalsis.
Peristalsis is an involuntary muscle contraction that moves rapidly along an organ like a wave (see Figure below ).
You can watch an animation of peristalsis at this link:  .
Peristalsis pushes food through the GI tract.
Accessory Organs of Digestion
Other organs involved in digestion include the liver, gall bladder, and pancreas.
They are called accessory organs because food does not pass through them.
Instead, they secrete or store substances needed for digestion.
Functions of the Digestive System
The digestive system has three main functions: digestion of food, absorption of nutrients, and elimination of solid food waste.
Digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb.
It consists of two types of processes: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion.
Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of chunks of food into smaller pieces.
