These organisms may seem useless, gross, and costly.
But fungi play very important roles in almost every terrestrial ecosystem on Earth.
Fungal mold growing on bread
The mold growing on this bread is a common fungus.
Fungi (singular, fungus) are a kingdom in the domain Eukarya.
The fungi kingdom may contain more than a million species, but fewer than 100,000 have been identified.
As shown in the Figure below , fungi include mushrooms and yeasts in addition to molds.
Examples of fungi: mushroom, yellow staghorn, jelly ears, mold, blue turkeytail
Several examples of fungi are pictured here.
Most fungi are multicellular, but some exist as single cells.
Single-celled fungi are known as yeasts.
Fungi spend most of their life cycle in the haploid state.
They form diploid cells only during sexual reproduction.
Like the cells of protists and plants, the cells of fungi have cell walls.
But fungi are unique in having cell walls made of chitin instead of cellulose.
Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the exoskeleton (outer skeleton) of insects and related organisms.
Habitats of Fungi
Fungi are found all around the world, and grow in a wide range of habitats, including deserts.
Most grow in terrestrial environments, but several species live only in aquatic habitats.
Most fungi live in soil or dead matter, and in symbiotic relationships with plants, animals, or other fungi.
