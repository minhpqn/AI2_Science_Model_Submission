As you can see above ( Figure above ), the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs.
Kidneys filter and clean the blood and form urine.
They are about the size of your fists and are found near the middle of the back, just below your ribcage.
Ureters are tube-shaped and bring urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
The urinary bladder is a hollow and muscular organ.
It is shaped a little like a balloon.
It is the organ that collects urine.
Urine leaves the body through the urethra .
What is Urine?
Urine is a liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they filter wastes from the blood.
Urine contains mostly water, but it also contains salts and nitrogen-containing molecules.
The amount of urine released from the body depends on many things.
Some of these include the amount of fluid and food a person consumes and how much fluid they have lost from sweating and breathing.
Urine ranges from colorless to dark yellow but is usually a pale yellow color.
Light yellow urine contains mostly water.
The darker the urine, the less water it contains.
The urinary system also removes a type of waste called urea from your blood.
Urea is a nitrogen-containing molecule that is made when foods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken down in the body.
Urea and other wastes are carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where they are removed and form urine.
The urinary system is made up of the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and the urethra.
