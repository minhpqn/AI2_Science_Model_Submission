This deadly allele is kept in the gene pool even though it does not help humans adapt to their environment.
This happens because evolution acts on the phenotype, not the genotype ( Figure below ).
Tay-Sachs disease, with autosomal recessive inheritance
Tay-Sachs disease is inherited in the autosomal recessive pattern.
Each parent is an unaffected carrier of the lethal allele.
Natural selection acts on the phenotype (the traits or characteristics) of an individual, not on the underlying genotype.
Carriers of a trait can show no symptoms of a recessive disease and, yet, still pass it on to their offspring.
