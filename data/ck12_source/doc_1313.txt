Transform Plate Boundaries
Transform plate boundaries produce enormous and deadly earthquakes.
These quakes at transform faults are shallow focus.
This is because the plates slide past each other without moving up or down.
The San Andreas Fault that runs through much of California is an enormous transform plate boundary.
It is the plate boundary between Pacific and North American plates.
The largest earthquake in recorded history on the San Andreas Fault occurred in 1906.
The quake's epicenter was just north of in San Francisco.
About 3,000 people died and 28,000 buildings were lost, mostly in the fire that followed the earthquake.
There are many other faults spreading off the San Andreas, to take up the plate motion.
In total the San Andreas Fault system produces around 10,000 earthquakes a year ( Figure below ).
While most of those earthquakes cannot even be felt by people nearby, occasionally one is very strong.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Hayward Fault was the site of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in 1868.

The San Andreas Fault runs through the San Francisco Bay Area.
Other related faults cross the region.
Lines indicate strike slip faults.
Lines with hatches are thrust faults.
Other significant earthquakes in California include the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake near Santa Cruz ( Figure below ) and the 1994 Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles.
