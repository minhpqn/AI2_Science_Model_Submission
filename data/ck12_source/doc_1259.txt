The seismographs located earthquake epicenters.
The epicenter is the point on Earthâ€™s surface directly above the place where an earthquake occurs.
When earthquake epicenters are put on a map, they outline the plates .
This is because the earthquakes where the plates come into contact with each other.
Earthquakes are found primarily in lines around the edges of some continents.
They are also found through the centers of some oceans.
Some occur in patches in some land areas.
If you look at the map pictured below, you will see that the lithosphere is divided into plates ( Figure below ).
There are a dozen major and several minor plates.
Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains.
Some plates are made of all oceanic lithosphere.
A few are all continental lithosphere.
But most plates are made of a combination of both.
Notice the locations where the most earthquake epicenters are found.

The outlines of the lithospheric plates can be seen.
Plates of lithosphere sink into the asthenosphere.
The asthenosphere, which is part of the upper mantle, is solid but can flow.
If a weight is added to a plate, like a glacier, the plate will sink into the mantle.
