Just one sample might be polluted.
This would be the sample taken at, or just downstream from, the single source of pollution.
In a field study, a scientist gathers evidence in the real world instead of in a lab.
Field studies are needed to investigate the environment.
An example of a field study is collecting samples of river water to test for evidence of pollution.
The mileage sticker pictured below states how many miles this car can go on 1 gallon of gas.
The sticker shows the mileage for city driving and for highway driving.
Unless you read the fine print at the bottom of the sticker, you would expect to get these mileages if you buy the car.
However, these mileages were measured under ideal conditions in a lab, not as cars are actually driven in the real world.
Gathering evidence to estimate average mileages in the real world would require a field study.
How do you think a scientist could gather evidence on the gas mileage of a car as it is actually driven in the real world?
Do you think drivers should expect to get lower or higher mileages than the values given on the sticker?
