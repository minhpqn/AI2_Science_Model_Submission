If I add water to a saturated sucrose solution, what will happen?
If I heat a solution and remove water, I see crystals at the bottom of the container.
What happened?
recrystallization:
The process of dissolved solute returning to the solid state.
saturated solution:
A solution that contains the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved.
solution equilibrium:
The physical state described by the opposing processes of dissolution and recrystallization occurring at the same rate.
unsaturated solution:
A solution that contains less than the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved.
