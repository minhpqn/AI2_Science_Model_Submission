Anderson define solubility in the video?
What is the solubility of talc in 100 mL of 25 Â°C water?
Explain why talc has this solubility.
Describe how increasing temperature affects the solubility of solid and liquid solutes.
Why is there less oxygen in ocean water near the equator than in water at higher latitudes?

Explain why.
What is solubility?
For a given solute and solvent, what factors affect solubility?
You open a can of room temperature soda and pour it into a glass.
Why does the soda go flat?
Will it go flat faster or slower if you add ice?
Why?
Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated solutions.
Decide whether a given solution is saturated or unsaturated.
You could add all the sugar in this scoop to the water in the measuring container, and all the sugar would dissolve, forming a sugar-water solution.
