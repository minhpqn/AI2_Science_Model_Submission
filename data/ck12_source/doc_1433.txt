Describe the characteristics of ponds and lakes.
Why are lakes important?
Lakes are important habitats for lots of plants and animals.
The slow motions of the water are easier for organisms to live in than the water from rapidly moving streams.
Some animals live on land but get at least part of their food from lakes or ponds.
This eagle is fishing for its meal.
What would happen if lakes dried up?
Ponds and Lakes
After a heavy rain, you may find puddles of water standing in low spots.
The same principle explains why water collects in ponds and lakes.
Water travels downhill, so a depression in the ground fills with standing water.
A pond is a small body of standing water.
A lake is a large body of standing water.
Most lakes have freshwater, but a few are salty.
The Great Salt Lake in Utah is an example of a saltwater lake.
The water in a large lake may be so deep that sunlight cannot penetrate all the way to the bottom.
Without sunlight, water plants and algae cannot live on the bottom of the lake.
Thatâ€™s because plants need sunlight for photosynthesis.
Water in Ponds and Lakes
Ponds and lakes may get their water from several sources.
