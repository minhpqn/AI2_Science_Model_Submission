Kepler-22b is the Earth-zone of a Sun-like star.
This means that the planet is the right distance from its star for life.
The planet could have liquid water, which is necessary for life on Earth.
Scientists do not know if there is life on Kepler-22b and won't for a long time.
It's fun to think about though!
An artist's depiction of Kepler-22b is pictured below ( Figure below ).

Now that scientists know how to identify extrasolar planets, the numbers of confirmed examples are increasing rapidly.
If there is life elsewhere in the Universe, it is most likely on an Earth-like exoplanet.
The gravitational pull of a planet may be detected in the slight motion of a star.
