Some insects can also use their antennae to detect sound.
Other sensory organs on the head include several simple eyes and a pair of compound eyes.
The compound eyes let insects see images.
Butterflies and bees can even see in color.
For feeding, the head contains one pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae .
Insects consume a wide range of foods, and their mouthparts have become specialized.
Several variations are shown in Figure below .

Mouthpart Specialization in Insects.
The mouthparts of insects are adapted for different food sources.
How do you think the different mouthparts evolved?
An insect’s abdomen contains most of the internal organs.
Like other arthropods, insects have a complete digestive system.
They also have an open circulatory system and central nervous system.
Like other terrestrial arthropods, they have trachea for breathing air and Malpighian tubules for excretion.
The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to fly.
Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly and were the first animals to evolve flight.
Flight has important advantages.
It’s a guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators.
It also aids in the search for food and mates.
