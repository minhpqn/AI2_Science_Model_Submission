Fog is a cloud that forms on tiny particles in the air close to the ground.
Condensation and the Water Cycle
The water cycle continuously recycles Earth’s water.
Condensation plays an important role in this cycle.
Find condensation in the water cycle Figure below .
It changes water vapor in the atmosphere to liquid water that can fall to Earth again.
Without condensation, the water cycle would be interrupted and Earth’s water could not recycle.

Q:
In the water cycle, what happens to water after it condenses?
A:
After water condenses, it may form clouds that produce precipitation such as rain.
The process in which water vapor or any other gas changes to a liquid is called condensation.
The temperature at which condensation of water vapor occurs is called the dew point.
The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content.
Condensation plays an important role in the water cycle.
Without it, Earth’s water could not recycle.
