Einstein’s theory has been supported by all evidence and observations to date, whereas Newton’s law of gravity does not apply to all cases.
Einstein’s theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today.
Q:
How might Einstein’s theory have influenced the course of science?
A:
Einstein’s theory suggested new areas of investigation.
Many predictions based on the theory were later found to be true.
For example, black holes in the universe were predicted by Einstein’s theory and later confirmed by scientific evidence.
Science has roots that go back thousands of years to Greek philosophers including Thales and Aristotle.
The scientific method was introduced in the 700s by a Persian scientist named Geber.
Modern science began with the scientific revolution in Europe the 1500s and 1600s.
The scientific revolution was launched by Copernicus’ new ideas about the solar system.
In the early 1900s, Einstein rocked science with his theory of gravity, which explained the concept in an entirely new way.
