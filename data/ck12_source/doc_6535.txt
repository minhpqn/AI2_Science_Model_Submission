Note that the table shows a variation of a structural formula called a condensed structural formula.
In this formula, the covalent bonds are understood to exist between each carbon and the hydrogens associated with it, as well as between carbon atoms.
This table also shows that the boiling points of the alkanes steadily increase as the length of the carbon chain increases.
This is due to an increase in the strength of the intermolecular attractive forces and is a general feature of other organic molecules as well.
Hydrocarbon definition and classifications are given.
Alkanes are defined and listed.
