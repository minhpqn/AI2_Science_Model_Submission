Its one valence electron is far removed from the nucleus, as you can see in the atomic model on the right, so it is easily removed from the atom.
Francium is radioactive and quickly decays to form other elements such as radium.
This is why francium is extremely rare in nature.
Less than an ounce of francium is present on Earth at any given time.
Q:
Francium decays too quickly to form compounds with other elements.
Which elements to you think it would bond with if it could?
A:
With one valence electron, francium would bond with a halogen element in group 17, which has seven valence electrons and needs one more to fill its outer energy level.
Elements in group 17 include fluorine and chlorine.
Group 1 of the periodic table includes hydrogen and the alkali metals.
Because they have just one valence electron, group 1 elements are very reactive.
As a result, they are found in nature only in combination with other elements.
Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature.
They are relatively soft and low in density.
From the top to the bottom of group 1, the elements have heavier, more reactive atoms.

From the top to the bottom of group 1, properties of the alkali metals change as follows:
