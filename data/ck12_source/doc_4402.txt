Ecology of Birds
Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on all seven continents, from the Arctic to Antarctica.
Because they are endothermic, birds can live in a wider range of climates than reptiles or amphibians, although the greatest diversity of birds occurs in tropical regions.
Birds are important members of every ecosystem in which they live, occupying a wide range of ecological positions.
Some birds are generalists.
A generalist is an organism that can eat many different types of food.
Other birds are highly specialized in their food needs and can eat just one type of food.
Raptors such as hawks and owls are carnivores.
They hunt and eat mammals and other birds.
Vultures are scavengers .
They eat the remains of dead animals, such as roadkill.
Aquatic birds generally eat fish or water plants.
Perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar.
Many fruit-eating birds play a key role in seed dispersal, and some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators .
Bird beaks are generally adapted for the food they eat.
For example, the sharp, hooked beak of a raptor is well suited for killing and tearing apart prey.
The long beak of the hummingbird in Figure below co-evolved with the tube-shaped flowers from which it sips nectar.
