Air that was warm and humid in the daytime also cools over night.
As the air cools, it can hold less water vapor.
Some of the water vapor condenses on the cool surfaces, such as blades of grass.
The temperature at which water vapor condenses is called the dew point .
If this temperature is below freezing, ice crystals of frost form instead of dew ( Figure below ).
The dew point occurs at 100 percent relative humidity.
Can you explain why?
Dew and frost form due to the dew point
The grass on the left is covered with dew.
The grass on the right is covered with frost.
The difference is the temperature of the grass.
Air reaches its dew point when humidity increases or temperature decreases.
Water droplets form when the air reaches 100% humidity.
If the temperature is cold enough, frost will form.
Relative humidity is how the air feels at its temperature and humidity.
