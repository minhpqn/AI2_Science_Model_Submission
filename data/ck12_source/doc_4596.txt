Tears wash pathogens from the eyes, and urine flushes pathogens out of the urinary tract.
You can watch the sweeping action of cilia at the following link:
A sneeze can expel many pathogens from the respiratory tract.
That’s why you should always cover your mouth and nose and when you sneeze.
Chemical barriers destroy pathogens on the outer body surface, at body openings, and on inner body linings.
Sweat, mucus, tears, and saliva all contain enzymes that kill pathogens.
Urine is too acidic for many pathogens, and semen contains zinc, which most pathogens cannot tolerate.
In addition, stomach acid kills pathogens that enter the GI tract in food or water.
Biological barriers are living organisms that help protect the body.
Millions of harmless bacteria live on the human skin.
Many more live in the GI tract.
The harmless bacteria use up food and space so harmful bacteria cannot grow.
Barriers that keep out pathogens are the body’s first line of defense.
The first line of defense includes mechanical, chemical, and biological barriers.
