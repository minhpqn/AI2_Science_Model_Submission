Describe homeostasis and how it is maintained.
Distinguish negative feedback from positive feedback.
How does your body react to cold?
These people may be having fun in the icy water, but their bodies are struggling to react to the cold.
For example, they may begin to shiver.
Shivering helps the body return to a stable temperature.
The body is always working to achieve stability, or homeostasis.
Homeostasis and Feedback Regulation
When you walk outside on a cool day, does your body temperature drop?
No, your body temperature stays stable at around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
Even when the temperature around you changes, your internal temperature stays the same.
This ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing environment is called homeostasis .
Homeostasis doesn't just protect against temperature changes.
Other aspects of your internal environment also stay stable.
For example, your body closely regulates your fluid balance.
You may have noticed that if you are slightly dehydrated, your urine is darker.
That's because the urine is more concentrated and less water is mixed in with it.
So how does your body maintain homeostasis?
The regulation of your internal environment is done primarily through negative feedback.
Negative feedback is a response to a stimulus that keeps a variable close to a set value ( Figure below ).
