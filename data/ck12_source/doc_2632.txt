A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions.
Bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence electrons.
Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that may be involved in chemical interactions.
Valence electrons are the basis of all chemical bonds.

Q:
Why do you think that chemical bonds form?
A:
Chemical bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons.
Why Bonds Form
To understand why chemical bonds form, consider the common compound known as water, or H 2 O.
It consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom.
As you can see in the on the left side of the Figure below , each hydrogen atom has just one electron, which is also its sole valence electron.
The oxygen atom has six valence electrons.
These are the electrons in the outer energy level of the oxygen atom.
Bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water
In the water molecule on the right in the Figure above , each hydrogen atom shares a pair of electrons with the oxygen atom.
By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level.
The hydrogen atoms each have a pair of shared electrons, so their first and only energy level is full.
