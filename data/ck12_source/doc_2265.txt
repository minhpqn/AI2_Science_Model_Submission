There are several different types of galaxies, and there are billions of galaxies in the Universe.
Types of Galaxies
Galaxies are divided into three types, according to shape.
There are spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies.
A spiral galaxy is a rotating disk of stars and dust.
In the center is a dense bulge of material.
Several spiral arms come out from the center.
Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and many young stars.
The image below ( Figure below ) shows a spiral galaxy from the side.
You can see the disk and central bulge.
The Pinwheel Galaxy has prominent arms
The Pinwheel Galaxy is a spiral galaxy displaying prominent arms.
The closest spiral galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy ( Figure below ) is 2,500,000 light years away and contains one trillion stars!
The Andromeda Galaxy is our nearest major neighbor
The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest major galaxy to our own.
Pictured below is a typical elliptical galaxy ( Figure below ).
As you might have guessed, elliptical galaxies are elliptical, or egg-shaped.
The smallest elliptical galaxies are as small as some globular clusters.
Giant elliptical galaxies can contain over a trillion stars.
Elliptical galaxies are reddish to yellowish in color because they contain mostly old stars.
