What is the boiling point of water in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit?
How does the boiling point of water change at altitudes below sea level?
Does water containing impurities boil at a higher or lower temperature than pure water?
What happens when a liquid is heated?
What is the boiling point?
What is the pressure at which the normal boiling point is determined?
boiling point:
The temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure.
vaporize:
When a substance turns from liquid into a gas.

Keeping the lid on a pot can help the water to boil faster
What is the fastest way to boil water?
One of the first lessons in cooking is how to boil water.
Yes, it sounds simple, but there are a couple of hints that speed things up.
One hint is to put a lid on the pot.
The picture above has water boiling uncovered with the steam escaping to the atmosphere.
If the lid is on the pot, less water will be boiled off and the water will boil faster.
The buildup of pressure inside the pot helps speed up the boiling process.
