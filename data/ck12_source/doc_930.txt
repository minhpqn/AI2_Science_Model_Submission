The magnet falling through the aluminum tube takes several times as long to fall the same distance.
Follow up questions:
In general, how would the observation change if the aluminum tube were replaced with a copper tube?
In general, how would the observation change if the glass tube were replaced with a copper tube?
Consider the sketch at below.
Will a current be induced in the coil on the right when the magnet passes through?
Two magnets being dropped through rings
Will a current be induced in the coil on the left when the magnet passes through?
If a current is induced in the coil when the magnet passes through, which way will the current flow?
If both magnets are dropped though the loops shown at the same time, which magnet would reach the ground first?
the one on the left
the one on the right
they would hit the ground together
Will a hand generator be more difficult to turn when it is generating current or when it is not generating current?
Lenzâ€™s law:
An induced electromotive force generates a current that induces a counter magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field generating the current.
back-EMF:
Back electromotive force is the voltage generated during the operation of a rotating machine (a generator or a motor).
Describe the function of a transformer.
Explain the relationship between turns and voltage ratio.
