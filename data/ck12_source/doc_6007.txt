Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given:
H 2 = 4.20 mol
mol of NH 3
The conversion is from mol H 2 â†’ NH 3 .
The problem states that there is an excess of nitrogen, so we do not need to be concerned with any mole ratio involving N 2 .
Choose the conversion factor that has the NH 3 in the numerator and the H 2 in the denominator.
Step 2:
Solve.
4.20 \text{ mol H}_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol NH}_3}{3 \text{ mol H}_2}=2.80 \text{ mol NH}_3
The reaction of 4.20 mol of hydrogen with excess nitrogen produces 2.80 mol of ammonia.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The result corresponds to the 3:2 ratio of hydrogen to ammonia from the balanced equation.
Mole ratios allow comparison of the amounts of any two materials in a balanced equation.
Calculations can be made to predict how much product can be obtained from a given number of moles of reactant.
Do problems 1-4 at the link below:
If a reactant is in excess, why do we not worry about the mole ratios involving that reactant?
What is the mole ratio of H to N in the ammonia molecule?
