Billions of these tiny water droplets come together to make up a cloud.
If the air is very cold, ice crystals form instead of liquid water.
Classification of Clouds
Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form.
Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus; there are other types of clouds, as well ( Figure below ).
Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere.
Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals.
They are thin and wispy.
Cirrus clouds don’t usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is coming.
Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere.
They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a thick blanket.
Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are called nimbostratus.
The prefix nimbo- means “rain.”
Cumulus clouds are white and puffy.
Convection currents make them grow upward, and they may grow very tall.
When they produce rain, they are called cumulonimbus.

What do they have in common?
They all form high in the troposphere.
