This process is known as semiconservative replication because one strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new DNA molecule ( Figure below ).
Diagram of DNA replication
DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands “unzip,” and the original strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form a new strand.
During DNA replication, the DNA helix unwinds and the two single strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a new stand to be created.
DNA replication is semi-conservative: the new DNA molecule consists of half of the parent DNA molecule.
