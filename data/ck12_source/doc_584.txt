When the ball of cells first implants into the uterus, it is called an embryo .
The embryo stage lasts until the end of the 8 th week after fertilization.
After that point until birth, the developing baby is called a fetus .
Growth and Development of the Embryo
During the embryo stage, the baby grows in size.
3 rd week after fertilization:
Cells of different types start to develop.
Cells that will form muscles and skin, for example, start to develop at this time.
4 th week after fertilization:
Body organs begin to form.
8 th week after fertilization:
All the major organs have started to develop.
Pictured below are some of the changes that take place during the 4 th and 8 th weeks ( Figure below ).
Look closely at the two embryos in the figure.
Do you think that the older embryo looks more human?
Notice that it has arms and legs and lacks a tail.
The face has also started to form, and it is much bigger.
Most organs develop in the embryo during weeks four through eight
Embryonic Development (Weeks 4â€“8).
Most organs develop in the embryo during weeks four through eight. (Note: the drawings of the embryos are not to scale.)
