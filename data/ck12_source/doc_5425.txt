lac operon :
An operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in E. coli.
leader peptide :
Translation product of a bacterial attenuator sequence; not part of a structural gene.
operator :
A region of prokaryotic DNA where a repressor protein binds.
operon :
A region of prokaryotic DNA with a promoter, an operator, and one or more genes that encode proteins needed to perform a certain task.
repressor :
A protein that binds to non-coding sequences on the DNA (operator) that are close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand.
trp operon :
An operon that codes for the components for production of the amino acid tryptophan.
Prokaryotic genes are arranged in operons, regions of DNA with a promoter, an operator, and one or more genes that encode proteins needed to perform a certain task.
The regulation of the lac operon is a key example of prokaryotic gene regulation.
When lactose is present, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and the operon is turned on; when lactose is unavailable, the lac repressor binds to the operator and the operon is turned off.
The trp operon is an example of negative regulation.
The trp operon is also regulated by attenuation, a process involving RNA secondary structures.
