Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues
Biotechnology will have a tremendous impact on our future - of this there is no doubt.
Is society entering some dangerous areas?
Well, many of these issues have never been analyzed until recently.
With the discovery of countless amounts of genetic information and the development of its applications, many ethical, legal and social issues ( ELSI ) need to be addressed.
The ability to sequence and analyze one's genome is both of tremendous value and tremendous concern.
Some ELSI issues (or questions) associated with the Human Genome Project are:
Who should have access to personal genetic information and how will it be used?
Who owns and controls genetic information?
How does personal genetic information affect an individual and society's perceptions of that individual?
How does genomic information affect members of minority communities?
How reliable and useful is fetal genetic testing?
How will genetic tests be evaluated and regulated for accuracy, reliability, and utility?
How do we prepare the public to make informed choices?
Should testing be performed when no treatment is available?
Should parents have the right to have their minor children tested for adult-onset diseases?
Are genetic tests reliable and interpretable by the medical community?
Where is the line between medical treatment and enhancement?
Are genetically modified foods and other products safe for humans and the environment?
How will these technologies affect developing nations' dependence on the West?
