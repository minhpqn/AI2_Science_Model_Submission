Hypothesis 1:
Atmospheric CO 2 has increased over the past five decades because the amount of CO 2 gas released by volcanoes has increased.
To test Hypothesis 1, we need to see if the amount of CO 2 gas released by volcanoes over the past several decades has increased.
There are two ways volcanoes could account for the increase in CO 2 :
There has been an increase in volcanic eruptions in that time.
The CO 2 content of volcanic gases has increased over time globally.
To test the first possibility, we can look at scientific literature from a site like Our research tells us that 50-70 eruptions occur every year.
We see that the number of volcanic eruptions is about constant.
We learn from different scientific papers that volcanic gas compositions have not changed over time.
Different types of volcanoes have different gas compositions.
However, the overall the gases are the same.
Another scientific paper states that major volcanic eruptions for the past 30 years have caused short-term cooling, not warming!
Hypothesis 1 is wrong!
Volcanic activity is not able to account for the rise in atmospheric CO 2 .
Remember that science is falsifiable.
We can discard Hypothesis 1.
When a hypothesis is wrong, often much has been learned anyway.
Rarely is the pursuit of a hypothesis a total loss!
