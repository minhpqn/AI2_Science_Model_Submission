The ice crystals are deposited on the glass, often in beautiful patterns like the “leaves” on the window above.
Be aware that deposition has a different meaning in Earth science than in chemistry.
In Earth science, deposition refers to the dropping of sediments by wind or water, rather than to a change of state.
Examples of Deposition in Nature
Deposition as a change of state often occurs in nature.
For example, when warm moist air comes into contact with very cold surfaces—such as the ground or objects on the ground—ice crystals are deposited on them.
These ice crystals are commonly called frost.
Look at the dead leaf and blades of grass in the Figure below .
They are covered with frost.
If you look closely, you can see the individual crystals of ice.
You can watch a demonstration of frost forming on the side of a very cold can at the URL below. (Click on the mulitmedia choice “Ice on a Can.”).
The ice in the can has been cooled to a very low temperature by adding salt to it.
If you want to do the demonstration yourself, follow the procedure at the URL.
Frost deposited on leaves
Q:
In places with very cold winters, why might frost be more likely to form on the ground in the fall than in the winter?
A:
Frost forms when the air is warmer than the ground.
This is more likely to be the case in the fall.
In the winter, the air is likely to be as cold as the ground.
