Oil shale is rock with oil dispersed through it.
The oil has not collected in reservoirs.
Oil shale is mined in open pit mines.
To extract the oil from the rock, the rock is first crushed and heated to very high temperatures.
Water is washed over the rock, which converts the fuel to petroleum.
The petroleum can then be extracted from the rock.
You can see an example of an oil shale facility below ( Figure below ).
Most of the world's oil shale is spread out in large areas of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado.
In this region, water is scarce.
Since the oil shale is spread over a large area, mining would be environmentally destructive.

Tar sands are rocky materials mixed with very thick oil.
The tar is too thick to pump, and so tar sands are strip-mined.
Hot water and caustic soda are used to separate the oil from the rock.
This creates a slurry, which is shaken.
The oil floats to the top and is skimmed off.
About 75% of the tar sands in the world are in Venezuela and Alberta, Canada ( Figure below ).
Large areas of land are degraded when tar sands are mined.
A tremendous amount of waste rock is produced from mining tar sands.
