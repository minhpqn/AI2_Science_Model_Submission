The inner part of the flow remains fluid.
The fluid lava flows through and leaves behind a tube.
Ropy pahoehoe flows are common on Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii
Ropy pahoehoe flows are common on Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii.
Pillow lava is created from lava that enters the water.
The volcanic vent may be underwater.
The lava may flow over land and enter the water ( Figure below ).
Once in the water, the lava cools very quickly.
The lava forms round rocks that resemble pillows.
Pillow lava is particularly common along mid-ocean ridges.
Lava erupting in the water can form bulbous, pillowy forms

Magmas differ in composition, which affects viscosity.
Magma composition has a large effect on how a volcano erupts.
Felsic lavas are more viscous and erupt explosively or do not erupt.
Mafic lavas are less viscous and erupt effusively.
Different lava types create different rock types, such as pahoehoe and a'a.
Lavas that cool underwater become pillow lavas.
