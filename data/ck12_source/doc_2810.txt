This results in acid fog and acid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower.
The pH chart in the Figure above and the Figure below reveal some of the adverse effects of acid fog and rain.
Acid rain not only kills trees.
It also lowers the pH of surface waters such as ponds and lakes.
As a result, the water may become too acidic for fish and other water organisms to survive.

Even normal (clean) rain is somewhat acidic.
Thatâ€™s because carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the air dissolves in raindrops, producing a weak acid called carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ), which has a pH of about 5.5.
When rainwater soaks into the ground, it can slowly dissolve rocks, particularly those containing calcium carbonate.
This is how water forms underground caves.
Q:
How do you think acid rain might affect buildings and statues made of stone?
A:
Acid rain dissolves and damages stone buildings and statues.
The Figure below shows a statue that has been damaged by acid rain.

The strength of an acid or base is called acidity.
It depends on how much of the substance breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water.
Acidity is measured by pH, which is the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution.
