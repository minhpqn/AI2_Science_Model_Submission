The stomach secretes a strong acid that allows pepsin to work, and the stomach to do its job.
However, when stomach contents enter the small intestine, the acid must be neutralized.
This is because enzymes in the small intestine need a basic environment in order to work.
An organ called the pancreas secretes a strong base into the small intestine, and this base neutralizes the acid.
A solution is a mixture of two or more substances that has the same composition throughout.
Some solutions are acids, some are bases.
Pure water has a pH of 7, so the point of neutrality on the pH scale is 7.
Acids have a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, and a pH lower than 7.
Bases have a lower concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, and a pH higher than 7.
Acids and bases are important in living organisms because most enzymes function best at a specific pH.
