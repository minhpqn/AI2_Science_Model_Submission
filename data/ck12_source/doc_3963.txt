Ecology discusses ecosystems.
An ecosystem consists of all the populations and the non-living aspects of the habitat.
Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction.
Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy.
The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the abiotic factors of that area.
The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system.
Recent surges in the human population have raised many important issues.
