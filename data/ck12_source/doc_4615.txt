When autoimmune disorders occur, these regulatory T cells fail in their function.
This results in damage to various organs and tissues.
The type of autoimmune disorder depends on the type of body tissue that is affected.
Some relatively common autoimmune diseases are listed in Table below .
These diseases cannot be cured, although they can be treated to relieve symptoms and prevent some of the long-term damage they cause.

Why does the immune system attack body cells?
In some cases, it’s because of exposure to pathogens that have antigens similar to the body’s own molecules.
