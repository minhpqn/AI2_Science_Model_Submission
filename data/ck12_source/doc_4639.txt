However, it does not complete meiosis until much later.
The primary oocyte remains in a resting state, nestled in a tiny, immature follicle until puberty.
Maturation of a Follicle
Beginning in puberty, each month one of the follicles and its primary oocyte starts to mature (also see Figure below ).
The primary oocyte resumes meiosis and divides to form a secondary oocyte and a smaller cell, called a polar body .
Both the secondary oocyte and polar body are haploid cells.
The secondary oocyte has most of the cytoplasm from the original cell and is much larger than the polar body.
Maturation of follicle and ovulation
Maturation of a Follicle and Ovulation.
A follicle matures and its primary oocyte (follicle) resumes meiosis to form a secondary oocyte in the secondary follicle.
The follicle ruptures and the oocyte leaves the ovary during ovulation.
What happens to the ruptured follicle then?
Ovulation and Fertilization
After 12â€“14 days, when the follicle is mature, it bursts open, releasing the secondary oocyte from the ovary.
This event is called ovulation (see Figure above ).
The follicle, now called a corpus luteum , starts to degenerate, or break down.
After the secondary oocyte leaves the ovary, it is swept into the nearby fallopian tube by the waving, fringelike end (see Figure below ).
Egg entering fallopian tube.
Egg Entering Fallopian Tube.
After ovulation, the fringelike end of the fallopian tube sweeps the oocyte inside of the tube, where it begins its journey to the uterus.
