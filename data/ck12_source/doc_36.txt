Monosaccharides (simple sugars)
Often include fatty acids
Carbohydrates are sugars, or long chains of sugars.
An important role of carbohydrates is to store energy.
Glucose ( Figure below ) is an important simple sugar molecule with the chemical formula C 6 H 12 O 6 .
Simple sugars are known as monosaccharides .
Carbohydrates also include long chains of connected sugar molecules.
These long chains often consist of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides bonded together to form polysaccharides .
Plants store sugar in polysaccharides called starch .
Animals store sugar in polysaccharides called glycogen .
You get the carbohydrates you need for energy from eating carbohydrate-rich foods, including fruits and vegetables, as well as grains, such as bread, rice, or corn.
Structure of a glucose molecule
A molecule of glucose, a type of carbohydrate.
Proteins are molecules that have many different functions in living things.
All proteins are made of monomers called amino acids ( Figure below ) that connect together like beads on a necklace ( Figure below ).
There are only 20 common amino acids needed to build proteins.
These amino acids form in thousands of different combinations, making about 100,000 or more unique proteins in humans.
Proteins can differ in both the number and order of amino acids.
It is the number and order of amino acids that determines the shape of the protein, and it is the shape (structure) of the protein that determines the unique function of the protein.
Small proteins have just a few hundred amino acids.
