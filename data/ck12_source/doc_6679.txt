Velocity and Acceleration
Explain the meaning of acceleration and how it differs from velocity.
Calculate average acceleration.
Students will learn the meaning of acceleration, how it is different than velocity and how to calculate average acceleration.
v = velocity (m/s)
v_i = initial velocity
v_f = final velocity
\Delta v = change in velocity = v_f - v_i
v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
a = acceleration (m/s^2)
a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
So in other words, acceleration tells you how quickly the velocity is increasing or decreasing.
An acceleration of  5 \ m/s^2  indicates that the velocity is increasing by  5 m/s  in the positive direction every second.
Gravity near the Earth pulls an object downwards toward the surface of the Earth with an acceleration of 9.8 \ m/s^2 ( \approx 10 \ m/s^2) .
In the absence of air resistance, all objects will fall with the same acceleration.
