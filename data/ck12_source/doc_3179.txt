Why Waves Break
In deep water, particles of water just move in circles.
They don’t actually move closer to shore with the energy of the waves.
However, near the shore where the water is shallow, the waves behave differently.
Look at the Figure below .
You can see how the waves start to drag on the bottom in shallow water.
This creates friction that slows down the bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves keep moving at the same speed.
The difference in speed causes the waves to get steeper until they topple over and break.
The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf.
Wave breaking on shore
Q:
In this diagram of a wave breaking near shore, where do you think a surfer would try to catch the wave?
A:
The surfer would try to catch the wave where it starts to steepen and lean forward toward the shore.
A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium.
Ocean waves are the best-known examples of surface waves.
In a surface wave, particles of the medium move up and down as well as back and forth in an overall circular motion.
The particles don’t actually move closer to shore as the waves pass through.
In shallow water close to shore, waves start to drag on the bottom of the water.
The bottoms—but not the tops—of the wave slow down because of friction.
