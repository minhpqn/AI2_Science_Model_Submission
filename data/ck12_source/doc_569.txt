The Female Reproductive System Functions
Most of the male reproductive organs are outside of the body.
But female reproductive organs are inside of the body.
The male and female organs also look very different and have different jobs.
Two of the functions of the female reproductive system are similar to the functions of the male reproductive system.
The female system:
Produces gametes , the reproductive cells, which are called eggs in females.
Secretes a major sex hormone, estrogen.
One of the main roles of the female reproductive system is to produce eggs.
Eggs ( Figure below ) are female gametes, and they are made in the ovaries.
After puberty, females release only one egg at a time.
Eggs are actually made in the body before birth, but they do not fully develop until later in life.
Like sperm, eggs are produced by meiosis, so they contain half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.
