Like the lionesses, it consumes prey species, in this case species of grass.
However, unlike the lionesses, the zebra does not kill its prey.
Predator-prey relationships such as these account for most energy transfers in food chains and food webs.

These lionesses feed on the carcass of a zebra.
Predation and Population
A predator-prey relationship tends to keep the populations of both species in balance.
This is shown by the graph in Figure below .
As the prey population increases, there is more food for predators.
So, after a slight lag, the predator population increases as well.
As the number of predators increases, more prey are captured.
As a result, the prey population starts to decrease.
What happens to the predator population then?
Predator-Prey Population Dynamics
Predator-Prey Population Dynamics.
As the prey population increases, why does the predator population also increase?
In the predator-prey example, one factor limits the growth of the other factor.
As the prey population deceases, the predator population is begins to decrease as well.
The prey population is a limiting factor.
