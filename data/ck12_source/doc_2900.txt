Imagine the sentence: “The big dog ate the red cat.” If you take out the second letter from "big," the frame will be shifted so now it will read: “The bgd oga tet her edc at.” One single deletion makes the whole “sentence” impossible to read.
A point mutation that adds a base (known as an insertion) would also result in a frameshift.
Mutations may also occur in chromosomes ( Figure below ).
These mutations are going to be fairly large mutations, possible affecting many genes.
Possible types of mutations in chromosomes include:
Deletion:
When a segment of DNA is lost, so there is a missing segment in the chromosome.
These usually result in many genes missing from the chromosome.
Duplication:
When a segment of DNA is repeated, creating a longer chromosome.
These usually result in multiple copies of genes in the chromosome.
Inversion:
When a segment of DNA is flipped and then reattached to the same chromosome.
Insertion:
When a segment of DNA from one chromosome is added to another, unrelated chromosome.
Translocation:
When two segments from different chromosomes change positions.
Mutations in chromosomes include deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion, and translocation
Mutations can arise in DNA through deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion, and translocation within the chromosome.
