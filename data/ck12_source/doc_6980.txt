Mixing these colors will produce the secondary , or complementary colors: magenta, cyan and yellow, as well as white.
On the diagram below label colors to show how this works:
Color printers use a different method of color mixing: color mixing by subtraction .
What colors are used in this process? (HINT: look at the ink colors in an ink-jet printer, CYMB).
The idea here is that each color subtracts from the reflected light â€“ for example, cyan ink reflects blue and green but SUBTRACTS red.
Explain with diagrams how CYM can be combined to produce red, blue, and green.
