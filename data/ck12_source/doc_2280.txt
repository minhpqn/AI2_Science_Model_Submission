Some of the most difficult topics to study are in cosmology.
The questions are age-old:
What formed the Universe?
What will be the fate of the Universe?
These are exciting questions to work on!
Dark matter and dark energy are two topics that are important to them.
We see many objects out in space that emit light.
We see other objects that emit other types of electromagnetic radiation.
The matter we can see is contained in stars.
The stars are contained in galaxies.
Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the Universe.
The rest of the matter is called dark matter .
Evidence for Dark Matter
Dark matter doesn’t emit light, so we can’t see it.
We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it.
For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate.
The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center.
This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see.
The way light bends around a very distant supermassive object is also due to dark matter ( Figure below ).
Dark matter is needed to explain the lensing around galaxies
