Both numbers are angles between your location, the center of Earth, and a reference line ( Figure below ).
Lines of latitude start with the Equator.
Lines of longitude begin at the prime meridian
Lines of latitude start with the Equator.
Lines of longitude begin at the prime meridian.
Lines of latitude circle around Earth.
The Equator is a line of latitude right in the middle of the planet.
Latitude is divided into degrees: 90° north of the Equator and 90° south of the Equator.
One degree is subdivided into 60 minutes.
One minute is subdivided into 60 seconds.
The Equator is at 0°.
The Equator is an equal distance from both the North and South Poles.
If you know your latitude, you know how far you are north or south of the Equator.
Lines of longitude are circles that go around Earth from pole to pole, like the sections of an orange.
Longitude is also measured in degrees, which are subdivided into minutes and seconds.
Lines of longitude start at the Prime Meridian, which is 0°.
The Prime Meridian is a circle that runs north to south and passes through Greenwich, England.
Longitude tells you how far you are east or west from the Prime Meridian ( Figure below ).
On the opposite side of the planet from the Prime Meridian is the International Date Line.
It is at 180°.
