Invertebrates are animals without a backbone.
They are the most numerous animals on Earth.
Most invertebrates are insects.
However, simpler invertebrates evolved before insects.
Some, like the sponges you will read about in this concept, have existed virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years.
Their continued existence is evidence that they are well adapted for their habitats.
They also evolved some of the most important traits that are found in almost all animals today.
Without the traits that evolved in sponges and other simple invertebrates, you would not exist.
Sponges are aquatic invertebrates that make up the phylum Porifera.
The word "porifera" means pore-bearing.
The phylum is aptly named.
As you can see from Figure below , a sponge has a porous body.
There are at least 5,000 living species of sponges.
Almost all of them inhabit the ocean, living mainly on coral reefs or the ocean floor.
See The First Animal at  for an introduction to sponges.
