Therefore, a line graph would be a good choice to display the data in the Table above .
The line graph below shows one way this could be done.
Q:
Based on the line graph above, describe the trend in tornado numbers by month throughout the course of a year.
A:
The number of tornadoes rises rapidly from a low in January to a peak in April.
This is followed by a relatively slow decline throughout the rest of the year.
Graphs are very useful tools in science because they display data visually.
Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs.
Each type of graph is suitable for a different type of data.
Bar graphs are suitable for comparing values for different things, such as the average numbers of tornadoes for different cities.
Circle graphs are used to show percents of a whole, such as the percent of all U.S. tornadoes with different strengths.
Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time, such as variation in the number of tornadoes by month throughout the year.
When you make a line graph, you need to locate x and y values on a set of axes.
This lets you plot the points that will be connected to create the line.

See how many flies you can catch while you practice plotting points.
What is the advantage of displaying data in a graph rather than just listing data in a table?
