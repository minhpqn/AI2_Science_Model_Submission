But he had a problem.
The problem was that he could not explain how the continents could move through the oceans.
He suggested that continental drift occurred like an icebreaker plows through sea ice ( Figure below ).
He thought the continents could cut through the ocean floor.
Wegener thought continental drift occurred as continents cut through the ocean floor, in the same way as this icebreaker plows through sea ice
An icebreaking ship.
Other scientists didn't buy his idea.
They thought that the continents would be much more deformed than they are.
Wegener believed that Africa and South America had once been joined.
He had the evidence.
But very few scientists accepted his idea.
He needed a mechanism that they would accept.
Alfred Wegener died in 1930 on an expedition on the Greenland icecap.
The continental drift hypothesis was put to rest for a few decades.
It was when technology could provide even more evidence for continental drift that scientists looked into the idea again.
Technology also helped scientists to develop a mechanism for how continents could drift.
Alfred Wegener said that the continents had been joined as a single landmass, which he called Pangaea.
Wegener thought that Pangaea was together about 300 million years ago.
Wegener could not develop a mechanism for continents moving through oceanic crust that other scientists would accept.
