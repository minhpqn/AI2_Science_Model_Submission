For centuries, scientists searched for the fundamental particles of matter and the “glue” that holds them together.
At first, scientists thought that atoms were the fundamental particles.
Now they know that there are smaller, simpler particles than atoms that make up matter and carry the forces that hold matter together.
Protons and neutrons are made up of fundamental particles of matter called quarks.
Electrons are another type of fundamental particles of matter called leptons.
Bosons are fundamental particles that carry forces between fundamental particles of matter.
Scientists think that a different type of boson carries each of the four fundamental forces in the universe (strong and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetic force, and gravity).
The standard model is a simple theory that explains all the matter in the universe and its interactions (except for the mass of matter and the force of gravity).
According to the standard model, all known matter consists of quarks and leptons, which interact by exchanging force-carrying particles called bosons.
