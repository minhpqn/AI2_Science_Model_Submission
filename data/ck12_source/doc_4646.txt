What is cell cleavage?
What happens during fertilization?
Where does it usually take place?
What is implantation?
When does it occur?
Describe a morula and blastocyst.
Embryo Growth and Development
Compare the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
Explain how the embryo forms specialized cells and organs.
At one time, did we all really look alike?
We all start as a single cell and soon grow into an embryo.
Notice the remarkable details beginning to form.
The eyes, backbone, and limb buds are obvious.
Think about the amazing complexity that must be going on inside the embryo, and the tremendous amount of growth and development still to come.
So, yes, at one time we all looked similar.
Growth and Development of the Embryo
After implantation occurs, the blastocyst is called an embryo .
The embryonic stage lasts through the eighth week following fertilization.
During this time, the embryo grows in size and becomes more complex.
It develops specialized cells and tissues and starts to form most organs.
