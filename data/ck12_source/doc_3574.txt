In the Calvin cycle, NADPH and ATP formed in the light reactions lose their stored chemical energy to build glucose.

Mechanism of the Calvin Cycle
Overview of the Calvin Cycle Pathway.
First, notice where carbon is fixed by the enzyme nicknamed RuBisCo.
In C 3 , C 4 , and CAM plants, CO 2 enters the cycle by joining with 5-carbon ribulose bisphosphate to form a 6-carbon intermediate, which splits (so quickly that it isn’t even shown!) into two 3-carbon molecules.
Now look for the points at which ATP and NADPH (made in the light reactions) add chemical energy (“Reduction” in the diagram) to the 3-carbon molecules.
The resulting “half-sugars” can enter several different metabolic pathways.
One recreates the original 5-carbon precursor, completing the cycle.
A second combines two of the 3-carbon molecules to form glucose, universal fuel for life.
The cycle begins and ends with the same molecule, but the process combines carbon and energy to build carbohydrates – food for life.
So, how does photosynthesis store energy in sugar?
Six “turns” of the Calvin cycle use chemical energy from ATP to combine six carbon atoms from six CO 2 molecules with 12 “hot hydrogens” from NADPH.
The result is one molecule of glucose, C 6 H 12 O 6 .
The reactions of the Calvin cycle add carbon (from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) to a simple five-carbon molecule called RuBP.
These reactions use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP that were produced in the light reactions.
The final product of the Calvin cycle is glucose.
