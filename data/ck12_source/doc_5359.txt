Eukaryotic mRNA Processing
Following transcription an mRNA is produced.
However, newly transcribed eukaryotic mRNA is not ready for translation.
This mRNA requires extensive processing, and so is known as pre-mRNA .
The modification processes include splicing, the addition of a 5â€™ cap, editing, and polyadenylation.
Once these process have occurred, the mature mRNA can be exported through the nuclear pore to the cytoplasm.
Humans have approximately 22,000 genes, yet make many more proteins.
How?
A process called alternative splicing allows one mRNA to produce many polypeptides.
To understand this concept, the structure of the pre-mRNA must be discussed.
Eukaryotic pre-mRNA contains introns and exons.
An exon is the region of a gene that contains the code for producing a protein.
Most genes contain many exons, with each exon containing the information for a specific portion of a complete protein.
In many species, a gene's exons are separated by long regions of DNA that have no identified function.
These long regions are introns , and must be removed prior to translation.
Splicing is the process by which introns are removed ( Figure below ).
Sometimes a process called alternative splicing allows pre-mRNA messages to be spliced in several different configurations, allowing a single gene to encode multiple proteins.
Splicing is usually performed by an RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome , but some RNA molecules have their own catalytic activity and are capable of acting like enzymes to catalyze their own splicing.
Bacterial mRNAs do not have introns.
