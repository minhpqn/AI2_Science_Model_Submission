Like all chordates, vertebrates have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail.
What other characteristics do vertebrates have?
Characteristics of Vertebrates
The main distinguishing feature of vertebrates is their vertebral column , or backbone (see Figure below ).
The backbone runs from the head to the tail along the dorsal (top) side of the body.
The vertebral column is the core of the endoskeleton .
It allows a vertebrate to hold its shape.
It also houses and protects the spinal (nerve) cord that passes through it.
The vertebral column is made up of repeating units called vertebrae (singular, vertebra ).
In many species, there are shock-absorbing discs between the vertebrae to cushion them during movement.
Human vertebral column and vertebrae
Human Vertebral Column and Vertebrae.
The human vertebral column consists of 33 vertebrae.
Two vertebrae are shown here enlarged.
See Vertebrates at  for additional information.
Another distinguishing feature of vertebrates is an endoskeleton made of bone or cartilage.
Cartilage is a tough tissue that contains a protein called collagen.
Bone is a hard tissue that consists of a collagen matrix, or framework, filled in with minerals such as calcium.
Bone is less flexible than cartilage but stronger.
An endoskeleton made of bone rather than cartilage allows animals to grow larger and heavier.
