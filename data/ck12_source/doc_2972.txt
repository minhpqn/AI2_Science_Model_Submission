As you can see, he’s really good at it.
He can even do tricks in the air.
It takes a lot of practice to be able to control a scooter like this.
Carson automatically applies just the right forces to control his scooter.
Force is defined as a push or pull acting on an object.
There are several fundamental forces in the universe, including the force of gravity, electromagnetic force, and weak and strong nuclear forces.
When it comes to the motion of everyday objects, however, the forces of interest include mainly gravity, friction, and applied force.
Applied force is force that a person or thing applies to an object.
Q :
What forces act on Carson’s scooter?
A :
Gravity, friction, and applied forces all act on Carson’s scooter.
Gravity keeps pulling both Carson and the scooter toward the ground.
Friction between the wheels of the scooter and the ground prevent the scooter from sliding but also slow it down.
In addition, Carson applies forces to his scooter to control its speed and direction.
Force and Motion
Forces cause all motions.
Everytime the motion of an object changes, it’s because a force has been applied to it.
Force can cause a stationary object to start moving or a moving object to change its speed or direction or both.
A change in the speed or direction of an object is called acceleration.
