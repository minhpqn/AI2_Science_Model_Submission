This type of telescope is called a reflecting telescope , or reflector.
Itâ€™s much easier to precisely make mirrors than to precisely make glass lenses.
Mirrors are also much lighter than heavy glass lenses.
For these two reasons, mirrors can be made larger than lenses.
This is important because a reflecting telescope can be made much larger.
Larger telescopes can collect more light.
This means that they can study dimmer or more distant objects.
The largest optical telescopes in the world today are reflectors.
Telescopes also can be made to use both lenses and mirrors.

Radio telescopes collect radio waves.
These telescopes are even larger telescopes than reflectors.
Radio telescopes look a lot like satellite dishes.
In fact, both are designed to collect and focus radio waves or microwaves from space.
The largest single radio telescope in the world is at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico ( Figure below ).
This telescope is located in a natural hole in the ground.
This telescope would collapse under its own weight if it were not supported by the ground.
There is a big disadvantage to this design.
What do you think it is?
The telescope can only observe the part of the sky that happens to be overhead at a given time.
