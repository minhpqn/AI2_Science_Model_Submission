How much energy?
E = mc 2 .
The change in mass is tiny, but it results in a great deal of energy.
Q :
In a nuclear reaction, mass decreases and energy increases.
What about the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy?
Are mass and energy not conserved in nuclear reactions?
Do we need to throw out these laws when it comes to nuclear reactions?
A :
No, the laws still apply.
However, it’s more correct to say that the sum of mass and energy is always conserved in a nuclear reaction.
Mass changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy combined remains the same.
Einstein’s equation, E = mc 2 , shows that matter and energy are two forms of the same thing.
It also shows that there is a tremendous amount of energy (E) in a small mass (m) of matter.
In nuclear reactions, matter changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy together does not change.
