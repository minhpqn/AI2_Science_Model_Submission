If the final temperature of both the aluminum and the water was 25^\circ C , what was the starting temperature of the metal?
Use the table above to find the specific heat of water and aluminum.
The key to this problem is connecting it with conservation of energy.
The energy that went into heating up the water must have come from heat stored in the metal.
Therefore, we know that the change in energy of the water is equal to however much energy the aluminum lost when it was put into the water.
When solving this problem, we'll call the energy of the aluminum Q_A and the energy of the water Q_w .
-\Delta Q_A&=\Delta Q_w && \text{start with conservation of energy}\\-m_Ac_A\Delta T_A&=m_wc_w\Delta T_w && \text{substitute in the values for each energy term based on the equation given above}\\\Delta T_A&=-\frac{m_wc_w\Delta T_w}{m_Ac_A} && \text{solve for } \Delta T_a\\T_f - T_i&=-\frac{m_wc_w\Delta T_w}{m_Ac_A} && \text{substitute in the initial and final temperatures for } \Delta T_A\\T_i&=T_f + \frac{m_wc_w\Delta T_w}{m_Ac_A} && \text{solve for } T_i\\T_i&=25^\circ C + \frac{500\;\text{g} * 1\;\text{cal/g}^\circ \text{C} * (25^\circ C - 20^\circ C)}{500\;\text{g} * .215\;\text{cal/g}^\circ \text{C}} && \text{plug in all the known values}\\T_i&=48.2^\circ C\\
