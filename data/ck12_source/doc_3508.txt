Viruses contain DNA but not much else.
They lack the other parts shared by all cells, including a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes.
Therefore, viruses are not cells, but are they alive?
All living things not only have cells; they are also capable of reproduction.
Viruses cannot reproduce by themselves.
Instead, they infect living hosts, and use the hostsâ€™ cells to make copies of their own DNA.
Viruses also do not have their own metabolism or maintain homeostasis.
For these reasons, most scientists do not consider viruses to be living things.
