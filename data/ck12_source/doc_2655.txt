Methane is a compound that contains only carbon and hydrogen.
Like many other compounds that consist of just these two elements, methane is used for fuel because it burns very easily.
Methane is an example of a covalent compound.
What Are Covalent Compounds?
Compounds that form from two or more nonmetallic elements, such as carbon and hydrogen, are called covalent compounds .
In a covalent compound, atoms of the different elements are held together in molecules by covalent bonds.
These are chemical bonds in which atoms share valence electrons.
The force of attraction between the shared electrons and the positive nuclei of both atoms holds the atoms together in the molecule.
A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound.
The largest, most complex covalent molecules have thousands of atoms.
Examples include proteins and carbohydrates, which are compounds in living things.
The smallest, simplest covalent compounds have molecules with just two atoms.
An example is hydrogen chloride (HCl).
It consists of one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom, as you can see in the Figure below .
You can watch an animation of hydrogen chloride forming at the following URL.

Naming and Writing Formulas for Covalent Compounds
To name simple covalent compounds, follow these rules:
Start with the name of the element closer to the left side of the periodic table.
Follow this with the name of element closer to the right of the periodic table.
