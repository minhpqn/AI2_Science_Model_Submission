When an object is launched exactly horizontally in projectile motion, it travels some distance horizontally before it strikes the ground.
In the present discussion, we wish to imagine a projectile fired horizontally on the surface of the earth such that while traveling 1600 m horizontally, the object would fall exactly 0.20 m.
If this could occur, then the object would fall exactly the amount necessary during its horizontal motion to remain at the surface of the earth, but not touching it.
In such a case, the object would travel all the way around the earth continuously and circle the earth, assuming there were no obstacles, such as mountains.
What initial horizontal velocity would be necessary for this to occur?
We first calculate the time to fall the 0.20 m:
t=\sqrt{\frac{2d}{a}}=\sqrt{\frac{(2)(0.20 \ \text{m})}{9.80 \ \text{m/s}^2}}=0.20 \ \text{s}
The horizontal velocity necessary to travel 1600 m in 0.20 s is 8000 m/s.
Thus, the necessary initial horizontal velocity is 8000 m/s.
In order to keep an object traveling in a circular path, there must be an acceleration toward the center of the circle.
This acceleration is called centripetal acceleration.  In the case of satellites orbiting the earth, the centripetal acceleration is caused by gravity.
If you were swinging an object around your head on a string, the centripetal acceleration would be caused by your hand pulling on the string toward the center of the circle.
It is important to note that the object traveling in a circle has a constant speed but does not have a constant velocity.
This is because direction is part of velocity; when an object changes its direction, it is changing its velocity.
Hence the object's acceleration.
The acceleration in the case of uniform circular motion  is the change in the direction of the velocity, but not its magnitude.
For an object traveling in a circular path, the centripetal acceleration is directly related to the square of the velocity of the object and inversely related to the radius of the circle.
Taking a moment to consider the validity of this equation can help to clarify what it means.
Imagine a yo-yo.
Instead of using it normally, let it fall to the end of the string, and then spin it around above your head.
