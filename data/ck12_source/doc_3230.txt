Like other waves, electromagnetic waves have properties of speed, wavelength, and frequency.
Speed of Electromagnetic Waves
All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through empty space.
That speed, called the speed of light , is about 300 million meters per second (3.0 x 10 8 m/s).
Nothing else in the universe is known to travel this fast.
The sun is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from Earth, but it takes electromagnetic radiation only 8 minutes to reach Earth from the sun.
If you could move that fast, you would be able to travel around Earth 7.5 times in just 1 second!

Wavelength and Frequency of Electromagnetic Waves
Although all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed across space, they may differ in their wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels.
Wavelength is the distance between corresponding points of adjacent waves (see the Figure below ).
Wavelengths of electromagnetic waves range from longer than a soccer field to shorter than the diameter of an atom.
Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time.
Frequencies of electromagnetic waves range from thousands of waves per second to trillions of waves per second.
The energy of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency.
Low-frequency waves have little energy and are normally harmless.
High-frequency waves have a lot of energy and are potentially very harmful.
