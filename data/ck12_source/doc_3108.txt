The surfer in this photo is dwarfed by the immense wave he’s riding, yet he’s managing to use the incredible energy of the wave for a thrilling ride.
Ocean waves like this one carry a huge amount of energy.
Do you know what energy is?
Can you identify other forms of energy besides ocean waves?
In this unit, you’ll learn a lot about energy, including how it makes modern life possible—even if you never ride a surfboard!
Explain the source of chemical energy.
Describe ways chemical energy is generated and used.
A dynamite explosion is a chemical reaction
What are some types of chemical reactions?
Some chemistry reactions can be very calm and boring, while other reactions release a great deal of energy.  Dynamite is a chemical that can explode violently.  Here we see dynamite being used to move boulders to clear a path for a road.  The chemical reactions involved here release tremendous amounts of energy very quickly.
Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1866.
Nitroglycerin, a very unstable explosive, was already known.  Nobel mixed the nitroglycerin with silica to stabilize it and form a solid material.
He made a fortune with this discovery and established the Nobel Foundation, which funds the Nobel Prizes every year.
Energy in Chemical Bonds
Chemical reactions either require energy or release energy.
The amount of energy needed or released depends upon the structure of the molecules that are involved in the reaction.  Some reactions need to be heated for long periods of time in order for change to take place.
Other reactions release energy, allowing heat to be given off to the surroundings.
This energy can be used in a variety of ways.
Coal, natural gas, oil – these materials can be burned to produce heat.
The reaction with oxygen releases a great deal of energy that can warm homes and offices.
