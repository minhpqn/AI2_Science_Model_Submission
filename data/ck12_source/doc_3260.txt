Describe how visible light interacts with matter.
Compare and contrast transparent, translucent, and opaque matter.
A mime is an actor who uses movement and facial expressions rather than words to communicate with an audience.
The mime in this picture is using a mirror to apply stage makeup that will accentuate her features so she can communicate more expressively.
When light strikes a mirror, it is reflected back from the shiny surface.
The reflected light forms an image of whatever is in front of the mirror.
Reflection is just one way that visible light may interact with matter.
Reflection of light occurs when light bounces back from a surface that it cannot pass through.
Reflection may be regular or diffuse.
If the surface is very smooth, like a mirror, the reflected light forms a very clear image.
This is called regular, or specular, reflection.
In the Figure below , the smooth surface of the still water in the pond on the left reflects light in this way.
When light is reflected from a rough surface, the waves of light are reflected in many different directions, so a clear image does not form.
This is called diffuse reflection.
In the Figure below , the ripples in the water in the picture on the right cause diffuse reflection of the blooming trees.

Transmission of light occurs when light passes through matter.
As light is transmitted, it may pass straight through matter or it may be refracted or scattered as it passes through.
When light is refracted, it changes direction as it passes into a new medium and changes speed.
