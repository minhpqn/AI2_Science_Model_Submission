Name two properties of materials that affect the speed of sound waves.
How do they affect the speed of sound?
Explain why sound waves moves more quickly through warmer air than cooler air.
What is the speed of sound in dry air at 20 °C?
Describe variation in the speed of sound through various media.
Explain how temperature affects the speed of sound.
Intensity and Loudness of Sound
Define intensity of sound and relate it to loudness.
Compare decibel levels of different sounds.
Identify factors that affect sound intensity.
A friend whispers to you in a voice so soft that she has to lean very close so you can hear what she’s saying.
Later that day, your friend shouts to you from across the gymnasium.
Now her voice is loud enough for you to hear her clearly even though she’s several meters away.
Obviously, sounds can vary in loudness.
It’s All About Energy
Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener.
The loudness of sound is determined, in turn, by the intensity of the sound waves.
Intensity is a measure of the amount of energy in sound waves.
The unit of intensity is the decibel (dB) .
The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds.
