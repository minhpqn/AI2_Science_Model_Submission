Many geologists do field work to better understand Earth.
Many others go on field trips to learn about certain types of geology.
In Glacier National Park, a geologist could learn about mountain building.
They could learn about how glaciers modify landscapes.
He could take photos to assist him in teaching a class.
He could just have a great time in a geologically fascinating area!
Many Earth scientists collect data in the field, called field work .
The data may be from observations or measurements.
The scientists may create a geological map of the area.
They might write detailed descriptions of the rocks and their relationships.
They may collect samples to analyze in the lab.
They may do a combination of all of these!
Earth science laboratories contain high-tech equipment.
That equipment can reveal the chemistry or age of a rock sample.
Geologists do field work to look for resources.
They may study a region for environmental cleanup.
There are many other reasons for going in the field.
One common reason is just to understand the region better.
To really understand geology and some of the other branches of Earth science, it's best to go out in the field!
Geology students in many colleges and universities go on a lot of field trips .
