How do you keep warm?
A camp fire is an example of basic thermochemistry.
The reaction is initiated by the application of heat from a match.
The reaction converting wood to carbon dioxide and water (among other things) continues, releasing heat energy in the process.
This heat energy can then be used to cook food, roast marshmallows, or just keep warm when itâ€™s cold outside.
Exothermic and Endothermic Processes
When physical or chemical changes occur, they are generally accompanied by a transfer of energy.
The law of conservation of energy states that in any physical or chemical process, energy is neither created nor destroyed.
In other words, the entire energy in the universe is conserved.
In order to better understand the energy changes taking place during a reaction, we need to define two parts of the universe, called the system and the surroundings.
The system is the specific portion of matter in a given space that is being studied during an experiment or an observation.
The surroundings is everything in the universe that is not part of the system.
In practical terms for a laboratory chemist, the system is the particular chemicals being reacted, while the surroundings is the immediate vicinity within the room.
During most processes, energy is exchanged between the system and the surroundings.
If the system loses a certain amount of energy, that same amount of energy is gained by the surroundings.
If the system gains a certain amount of energy, that energy is supplied by the surroundings.
In the study of thermochemical processes, things are viewed from the point of view of the system.
A chemical reaction or physical change is endothermic if heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings.
In the course of an endothermic process, the system gains heat from the surroundings and so the temperature of the surroundings decreases.
The quantity of heat for a process is represented by the letter q .
