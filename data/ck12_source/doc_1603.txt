Obviously, the cell could not survive in such an environment.
So something must protect the cell and allow it to survive in its water-based environment.
All cells have a barrier around them that separates them from the environment and from other cells.
This barrier is called the plasma membrane , or cell membrane.
The Plasma Membrane
The plasma membrane ( Figure below ) is made of a double layer of special lipids, known as phospholipids .
The phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a hydrophilic ("water-loving") head and two hydrophobic ("water-hating") tails.
Because of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in a specific pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically be in contact with water.
Remember that there is water outside the cell, and the cytoplasm inside the cell is mostly water as well.
So the phospholipids are arranged in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the cell separate from its environment.
Lipids do not mix with water (recall that oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and keeping the cytoplasm inside the cell.
The cell membrane allows the cell to stay structurally intact in its water-based environment.
The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell.
Some molecules can go through the cell membrane to enter and leave the cell, but some cannot.
The cell is therefore not completely permeable. "Permeable" means that anything can cross a barrier.
An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants to enter or exit through the door.
The plasma membrane is semipermeable , meaning that some things can enter the cell, and some things cannot.

Plasma membranes are primarily made up of phospholipids (orange).
The hydrophilic ("water-loving") head and two hydrophobic ("water-hating") tails are shown.
