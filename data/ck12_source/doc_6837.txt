Eating shellfish during a red tide can cause serious illness and even death to humans.
Tastes in molluscan food vary tremendously from one person to the next and from culture to culture; however, when it comes to a question of survival, most mollusks are edible.
Some are considered delicacies such as oysters and escargot (a snail that lives in trees),  while others such as the clams and mussels of freshwater ponds and streams are less likely to be consumed due to taste, but none-the-less are very edible.
Land-based mollusks are also eaten.
France alone consumes 5 million pounds of escargot every year.
Of course, some people are allergic to mollusks and need to be careful about consuming any kind of shelled animals.
Mollusks in Decoration and Jewelry
Two natural products of mollusks used for decorations and jewelry are pearls and nacre.
A pearl is the hard, round object produced within the mantle of a living shelled mollusk.
Pearls are produced by many bivalves when a tiny particle of sand or grit is trapped between the mantle and the shell.
It's as if the mollusk has a splinter.
The mollusk forms a protective covering around the irritant.
Most pearls used as jewelry are made by pearl oysters and freshwater mussels; most of the ones sold are cultured and not wild.
Natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries.
The most desirable pearls are produced by oysters and river mussels.
The substance used to form the pearl covering is made from the mother of pearl material that lines the interior of the shell.
Mother of pearl is also known as nacre.
Nacre is the iridescent inner shell layer.
It can be found in buttons, watch faces, knives, guns, and jewelry.
It is also used to decorate various musical instruments.
