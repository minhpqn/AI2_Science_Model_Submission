What are the characteristics of the other dwarf planets that have been recognized?
At the center of the solar system is our star, the Sun.
The Sun gets its power from the fusion of hydrogen and helium.
The Sun has no solid parts, but it has layers.
Much of what the Sun is made of is plasma.
The Sun's surface features, like sunspots, can affect Earth.
Eight planets orbit the Sun.
The four nearest the Sun are small, dense, and rocky.
The four farthest from the Sun are large and gaseous.
Mercury is the smallest planet.
It is closest to the Sun so it is extremely hot.
Venus has a thick, atmosphere with a lot of carbon dioxide.
The carbon dioxide gives the planet a large greenhouse effect so it is very hot.
Earth, the third rock from the Sun, is the only one of the inner planets with a large moon.
The Moon is the only body in the Universe, besides Earth, where humans have walked.
The red planet, Mars, is the most Earth-like.
The planet has volcanoes, channels where water once flowed and an enormous canyon.
The four gas planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
They are made of hydrogen, helium, and some methane and other gases.
All have rings and moons.
