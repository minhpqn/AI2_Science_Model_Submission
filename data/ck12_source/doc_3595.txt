Ethanol is produced by alcoholic fermentation of the glucose in corn or other plants.
This type of fermentation also explains why bread dough rises.
Yeasts in bread dough use alcoholic fermentation and produce carbon dioxide gas.
The gas forms bubbles in the dough, which cause the dough to expand.
The bubbles also leave small holes in the bread after it bakes, making the bread light and fluffy.
Do you see the small holes in the slice of bread in Figure below ?
Holes in bread are due to alcoholic fermentation
The small holes in bread are formed by bubbles of carbon dioxide gas.
The gas was produced by alcoholic fermentation carried out by yeast.
Behind every fart is an army of gut bacteria undergoing some crazy biochemistry.
These bacteria break down the remains of digested food through fermentation, creating gas in the process.

Fermentation is making ATP without oxygen, which involves glycolysis only.
Fermentation recycles NAD + , and produces 2 ATPs.
In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvic acid from glycolysis changes to lactic acid.
This type of fermentation is carried out by the bacteria in yogurt, and by your own muscle cells.
In alcoholic fermentation, pyruvic acid changes to alcohol and carbon dioxide.
This type of fermentation is carried out by yeasts and some bacteria.
