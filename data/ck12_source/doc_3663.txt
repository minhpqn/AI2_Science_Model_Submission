The individual may be homozygous (two of the same alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles).
The expression of an organism’s genotype produces its phenotype.
When only one of two alleles is expressed, the expressed allele is the dominant allele, and the allele that isn’t expressed is the recessive allele.
Mendel used the percentage of phenotypes in offspring to understand how characteristics are inherited.
