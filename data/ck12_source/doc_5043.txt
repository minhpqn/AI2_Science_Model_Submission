This process is carbon fixation .
Stomata on the underside of leaves take in CO 2 and release water and O 2 .
Guard cells close the stomata when water is scarce.
Leaf cross-section (above) and stoma (below).
Plants have evolved three pathways for carbon fixation.
The most common pathway combines one molecule of CO 2 with a 5-carbon sugar called ribulose biphosphate (RuBP).
The enzyme which catalyzes this reaction, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (nicknamed RuBisCo ), is the most abundant enzyme on earth!
The resulting 6-carbon molecule is unstable, so it immediately splits into two much more stable 3-carbon phosphoglycerate molecules.
The 3 carbons in the first stable molecule of this pathway give this largest group of plants the name “C-3.”
Dry air, hot temperatures, and bright sunlight slow the C-3 pathway for carbon fixation.
This is because the stomata , tiny openings under the leaf which normally allow CO 2 to enter and O 2 to leave, must close to prevent loss of water vapor ( Figure above ) by transpiration .
Closed stomata lead to a shortage of CO 2 .
Two alternative pathways for carbon fixation demonstrate biochemical adaptations to differing environments.
All three carbon fixation pathways lead to the Calvin Cycle to build sugar.

Even chemical reactions adapt to specific environments.
Carbon fixation pathways vary among three groups.
Temperate species (maple tree, left) use the C-3 pathway.
C-4 species (corn, center) concentrate CO 2 in a separate compartment to lessen water loss in hot bright climates.
