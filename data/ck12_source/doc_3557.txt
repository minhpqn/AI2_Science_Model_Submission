Where does this energy come from?
Though this food chains "ends" with decomposers, do decomposers, in fact, digest matter from each level of the food chain? (see the "Flow of Energy" concept.)
These tubeworms get their energy from chemosynthesis
Tubeworms deep in the Galapagos Rift get their energy from chemosynthetic bacteria living within their tissues.
No digestive systems needed!
Making and Using Food
The flow of energy through living organisms begins with photosynthesis.
This process stores energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of glucose.
By breaking the chemical bonds in glucose, cells release the stored energy and make the ATP they need.
The process in which glucose is broken down and ATP is made is called cellular respiration .
Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are like two sides of the same coin.
This is apparent from Figure below .
The products of one process are the reactants of the other.
Together, the two processes store and release energy in living organisms.
The two processes also work together to recycle oxygen in Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
This diagram compares and contrasts photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
It also shows how the two processes are related.
Photosynthesis is often considered to be the single most important life process on Earth.
It changes light energy into chemical energy and also releases oxygen.
Without photosynthesis, there would be no oxygen in the atmosphere.
