The f sublevel is always two levels behind.
The 4 f sublevel belongs to the sixth period.
The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called periods.
The length of a period depends on how many electrons are needed to occupy the sublevels that fill the period.
Blocks indicate which sublevel is being filled.
