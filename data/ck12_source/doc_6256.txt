Sample Problem:
Calculating Specific Heat
A 15.0 g piece of cadmium metal absorbs 134 J of heat while rising from 24.0°C to 62.7°C.
Calculate the specific heat of cadmium.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem .
heat = q = 134 J
mass =  m = 15.0 g
\Delta{\text{T}} = 62.7^\circ \text{C} - 24.0^\circ \text{C} = 38.7^\circ \text{C}
c_p \ \text{of cadmium}= ? \ \text{J}/ \text{g}^\circ \text{C} \\
The specific heat equation can be rearranged to solve for the specific heat.
Step 2:
Solve .
c_p=\frac{q}{m \times \Delta{T}}=\frac{134 \text{ J}}{15.0 \text{ g} \times 38.7^\circ \text{C}}=0.231 \text{ J/g}^\circ \text{C}
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The specific heat of cadmium, a metal, is fairly close to the specific heats of other metals.
The result has three significant figures.
Since most specific heats are known, they can be used to determine the final temperature attained by a substance when it is either heated or cooled.
Suppose that a 60.0 g sample of water at 23.52°C was cooled by the removal of 813 J of heat.
