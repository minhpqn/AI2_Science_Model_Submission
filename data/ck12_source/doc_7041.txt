After some hard work, you measure the current amount of ^{14}\mathrm{C} in the skeleton to be 0.000054 grams.
How old is this skeleton?
Are you famous?
Micol had in her lab two samples of radioactive isotopes: ^{151}\mathrm{Pm} with a half-life of 1.183 days and ^{134}\;\mathrm{Ce} with a half-life of 3.15 days.
She initially had 100 \;\mathrm{mg} of the former and 50 \;\mathrm{mg} of the latter.
Do a graph of quantity remaining (vertical axis) vs. time for both isotopes on the same graph.
Using the graph determine at what time the quantities remaining of both isotopes are exactly equal and what that quantity is.
Micol can detect no quantities less than 3.00 \;\mathrm{mg} .
Again, using the graph , determine how long she will wait until each of the original isotopes will become undetectable.
The Pm goes through \beta- decay and the Ce decays by means of electron capture.
What are the two immediate products of the radioactivity?
It turns out both of these products are themselves radioactive; the Pm product goes through \beta- decay before it becomes stable and the Ce product goes through \beta+ decay before it reaches a stable isotope.
When all is said and done, what will Micol have left in her lab?

In these lessons students will develop a deep understanding of radiation and how to solve problems involving the half life and decay constant equations.
In addition, the lesson on carbon dating covers an understanding and also develops the skills to solve carbon dating problems.
