The ozone hole has moved north.
Too much of the Sun's harmful UV radiation gets through.
Loss of High-Level Ozone
Ozone near the ground harms human health.
Ground-level ozone is a pollutant.
But the ozone layer in the stratosphere protects us from harmful solar rays.
That’s why people were alarmed in the 1980s to learn that there was a hole in the ozone layer.
Cause of Ozone Loss
What’s destroying the ozone layer?
The chief cause is chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
These are human-made chemicals that contain the element chlorine (Cl).
In the past, CFCs were widely used in spray cans, refrigerators, and many other products.
CFCs are stable compounds that can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.
Once CFCs are in the air, they float up into the stratosphere.
What happens next is pictured below ( Figure below ).
Sunlight breaks apart the molecules.
This releases their chlorine ions (Cl).
The free chlorine ions may then combine with oxygen ions in ozone.
This breaks down the ozone molecules into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen ion.
One CFC molecule can break down as many as 100,000 ozone molecules in this way!
