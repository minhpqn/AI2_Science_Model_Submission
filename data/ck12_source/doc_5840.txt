Can the empirical formula for a compound be the same as the molecular formula?
What do we need to know in order to determine a molecular formula from an empirical formula?
Give three examples of compounds whose empirical formulas are the same as their molecular formulas.
empirical formula:
A formula that shows the elements in a compound in their lowest whole-number ratio.
Explain how cations are formed.
Describe the naming of cations.
Describe how cations are designated.
Native gold nuggets
Have you ever gone digging for gold?
When the prospectors during the California Gold Rush (1848-1855) searched for gold nuggets in the earth, they were able to find these nuggets because gold is an unreactive material that exists in its elemental state in many places.  Not everyone was fortunate enough to find large nuggets such as those shown above, but a number of these miners did become very wealthy (of course, a large number of others went back home broke).
Many of the elements we know about do not exist in their native form.
They are so reactive that they are found only in compounds.
These non-elemental forms are known as ions.
Their properties are very different from those of the elements they come from.
The term comes from a Greek word meaning “move” and was first coined by Michael Faraday, who studied the movement of materials in an electrical field.
Electron configuration of sodium metal and sodium cation
Sodium loses an electron to become a cation.
Some elements lose one or more electrons in forming ions.
These ions are known as “ cations ” because they are positively charged and migrate toward the negative electrode ( cathode ) in an electrical field.  Looking at the periodic table below, we know that the group 1 elements are all characterized by having one s electron in the outer orbit and group 2 elements have two s electrons in the outer orbit.
