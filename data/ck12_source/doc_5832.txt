Protists and Fungi are two types of eukaryotic organisms.
What do they have in common?
Protists are the earliest eukaryotes, and this kingdom contains some of the simplest eukaryotes.
Many are single-celled organisms.
Protists consist of animal-like, plant-like, and fungus-like species.
Protists evolved into the other three types of eukaryotes, including fungi.
Other than that, these two types of eukaryotes are very different.
Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that cannot make their own food and do not "eat." They must absorb their nutrients, usually from decaying organisms.
