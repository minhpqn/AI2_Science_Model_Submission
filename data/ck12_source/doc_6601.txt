A combination of amino acids in which the amino group of one amino acid has undergone a reaction with the carboxyl group of another amino acid.
peptide bond:
The amide bond that occurs between the amino nitrogen of one amino acid and the carboxyl carbon of another amino acid.
List and describe the four levels of protein structure.

A Serious Shift
Hemoglobin is a complex protein which has a quaternary structure and contains iron.
There are four subunits in the hemoglobin molecule â€“ two alpha subunits and two beta subunits.
Each subunit contains one iron ion, whose oxidation state changes from +2 to +3 and back again, depending upon the environment around the iron.
When the oxygen binds to the iron, the three-dimensional shape of the molecule changes.
Upon release of the oxygen to the cells, the shape changes again.
With hemoglobin of normal structure, this shift in conformation does not present any problems.
However, individuals with hemoglobin S do experience serious complications.
This hemoglobin has one amino acid in the two beta chains that is different from the amino acid at that point in the primary structure of normal hemoglobin.
The result of this one structural change is aggregation of the individual protein molecules when oxygen is released.
Adjacent hemoglobin molecules come in contact with one another and clump up, causing the red cells to deform and break.
This abnormality, known as sickle cell, is genetic in nature.
A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening.
Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, a very serious condition.
A polypeptide is a sequence of amino acids between ten and one hundred in length.
