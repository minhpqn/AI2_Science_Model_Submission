The modern periodic table is used to organize all the known elements.
Elements are arranged in the table by increasing atomic number.
In the modern periodic table, each element is represented by its chemical symbol.
The number above each symbol is its atomic number.
Atomic numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom in the table.
Rows of the periodic table are called periods.
From left to right across a period, each element has one more proton than the element before it.
Columns of the periodic table are called groups.
Elements in the same group have similar properties.
All elements can be classified in one of three classes: metals, metalloids, or nonmetals.
Elements in each class share certain basic properties.
From left to right across each period of the periodic table, elements change from metals to metalloids to nonmetals.
