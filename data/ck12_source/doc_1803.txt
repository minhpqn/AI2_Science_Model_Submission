Climate affects chemical weathering.
Chemical weathering increases as:
Temperature increases.
Chemical reactions are faster at higher temperatures.
Precipitation increases.
Chemical reactions increase when there is more water.
Since water increases both mechanical and chemical weathering, more water strongly increases weathering.
Look at how temperature and precipitation change weathering.
What type of climate has the lowest weathering rate?
A cold, dry climate.
A warm, wet climate has the highest weathering rate.
Plants increase mechanical and chemical weathering.
Plant roots may enter cracks in rock and break it apart.
Plant debris may increase the amount of acid in water.
The warmer and wetter a climate is, the more plants it will have.
Bacteria also grow more in warm, wet regions.
So, warm, wet climates have more weathering from biological processes.
Resources from Weathering
Weathering may concentrate some resources.
In tropical climates, chemical weathering can be intense.
