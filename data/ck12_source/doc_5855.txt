The two families were bitter rivals, but Juliet was saying she loved Romeo no matter what his name was.
Some names are simple – we know Romeo mainly as Romeo.
Most have us have a first name, middle name (often not used), and last name.
In some cultures, names will be much more complex.
The full name of the famous 20 th century artist Pablo Picasso is Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Martyr Patricio Clito Ruíz y Picass.
Many materials exist as simple binary compounds composed of a metal cation and a non-metal anion, with each ion consisting of only one type of atom.  Other combinations of atoms also exist, either larger ionic complexes or complete molecules.  Some of the most useful materials we work with contain polyatomic ions.
A polyatomic ion is an ion composed of more than one atom.
The ammonium ion consists of one nitrogen atom and four oxygen atoms.
Together, they comprise a single ion with a 1+ charge and a formula of NH 4 + .
The carbonate ion consists of one carbon atom and three oxygen atoms and carries an overall charge of 2−.
The formula of the carbonate ion is CO 3 2- .
The atoms of a polyatomic ion are tightly bonded together and so the entire ion behaves as a single unit.
The figures below show several models.
Structure of an ammonium ion
A.
The ammonium ion (NH 4 + ) is a nitrogen atom (blue) bonded to four hydrogen atoms (white).
Structure of a hydroxide ion
B.
The hydroxide ion (OH - ) is an oxygen atom (red) bonded to a hydrogen atom.
