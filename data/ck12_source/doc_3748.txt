Explain the roles of the operator, the promoter, and the repressor.
Summarize regulation of the lac operon.
On or off?
When it comes to genes, that is an important question.
And if you're a single-celled organism like a bacterium, conserving energy by not producing unnecessary proteins is very important.
Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
Transcription is regulated differently in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
In general, prokaryotic regulation is simpler than eukaryotic regulation.
The Role of Operons
Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves operons.
An operon is a region of DNA that consists of one or more genes that encode the proteins needed for a specific function.
The operon also includes a promoter and an operator.
The operator is a region of the operon where regulatory proteins bind.
It is located near the promoter and helps regulate transcription of the operon genes.
The Lac Operon
A well-known example of operon regulation involves the lac operon in E. coli bacteria (see Figure below and the video at the link below).
The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes that encode the enzymes needed to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk.
The lac operon is regulated by lactose in the environment.
The Lac Operon video at explains the operon in further detail.
When lactose is absent, a repressor protein binds to the operator.
