This is because Earth revolves around the Sun.
The constellations in the winter are different from those in the summer.
For example, Orion is high up in the winter sky.
In the summer, it's only up in the early morning.
Constellations are useful.
They help astronomers and other observers orient in the night sky.
The star Betelgeuse, for example, is Orion's right shoulder.
Betelgeuse is the eighth brightest star in the sky.
The star is an excellent example of a red supergiant.
Apparent Versus Real Distances
The stars in a constellation appear close together in our night sky.
But they are not at all close together out in space.
In the constellation Orion, the stars visible to the naked eye are at distances ranging from just 26 light-years (which is relatively close to Earth) to several thousand light-years away.
What is Astrology?
Ancient Babylonian astronomers created the Zodiac.
The Zodiac is a circle that divides the ecliptic into twelve 30-degree zones.
Each zone contains a constellation, many of them animals.
Horoscopes based on these astrological signs first appeared in Ptolemaic Egypt in around 50 BC.
These early people used astrology to explain things that are now much better explained by science.
You can see an example of a Zodiac below ( Figure below ).
