Steps to follow are outlined in the text.
Step 2:  Calculate.
Assume a 100 g sample.
& 69.94 \ \text{g Fe} \\& 30.06 \ \text{g O}
Convert to moles.
69.94 \ \text{g Fe} \times \frac{1 \ \text{mol Fe}}{55.85 \ \text{g Fe}}&=1.252 \ \text{mol Fe} \\30.06 \ \text{g O} \times \frac{1 \ \text{mol O}}{16.00 \ \text{g O}}&=1.879 \ \text{mol O}
Divide both moles by the smallest of the results.
\frac{1.252 \ \text{mol Fe}}{1.252}=1 \ \text{mol Fe} \qquad \qquad \frac{1.879 \ \text{mol O}}{1.252}=1.501 \ \text{mol O}
4/5.
Since the moles of O, is still not a whole number, both moles can be multiplied by 2, while rounding to a whole number.
1 \ \text{mol Fe} \times 2=2 \ \text{mol Fe} \qquad \qquad 1.501 \ \text{mol O} \times 2=3 \ \text{mol O}
The empirical formula of the compound is Fe 2 O 3 .
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The subscripts are whole numbers and represent the mole ratio of the elements in the compound.  The compound is the ionic compound iron(III) oxide.
A process is described for the calculation of the empirical formula for a compound based on the percent composition of that compound.
