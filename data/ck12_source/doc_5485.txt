pharmacogenomics :
Field that is tailoring medical treatments to fit our genetic profiles.
preimplantation genetic diagnosis :
Genetic analysis performed on embryos prior to implantation.
prenatal diagnosis :
The diagnosis of a disease or condition before a baby is born.
prenatal screening :
A variety of tests can be used to detect birth defects and other genetic disorders in a developing baby prior to birth.
recombinant DNA :
DNA engineered through the combination of two or more DNA strands; combines DNA sequences which would not normally occur together.
single nucleotide polymorphism :
A DNA sequence variation occurring when a single nucleotide differs between members of a species or paired chromosomes in an individual.
Synthetic Biology :
Field of biology involved in engineering new functions from living systems.
In medicine, modern biotechnology provides significant applications in such areas as pharmacogenomics, genetic testing (prenatal diagnosis), and gene therapy.
Pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology and genomics, is the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics.
Pharmacogenomics will result in the following benefits:
Development of tailor-made medicines.
More accurate methods of determining appropriate drug dosages.
Improvements in the drug discovery and approval process.
