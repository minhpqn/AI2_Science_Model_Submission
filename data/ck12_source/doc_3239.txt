Explain how radio waves are used to encode sounds and pictures in television broadcasts.
Outline the electromagnetic spectrum.
Describe microwaves and list their uses.
Explain how microwaves are used in cell phone transmissions.
Define radar and explain how it works.
This person is pointing a gun at a kid practicing his baseball pitch.
But it’s not the type of gun that can be used as a weapon.
It’s a radar gun, and it’s used to detect the speed of moving objects.
It has measured this pitch to be going at 51 miles per hour.
Do you know how a radar gun works?
Instead of shooting bullets, it “shoots” electromagnetic waves.
Defining Electromagnetic Waves
Electromagnetic waves carry energy through matter or space as vibrating electric and magnetic fields.
Electromagnetic waves have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies.
The complete range is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
The Figure below shows all the waves of the spectrum.
The waves used in radar guns are microwaves.
Find the microwave in the Figure above .
A microwave is an electromagnetic wave with a relatively long wavelength and low frequency.
Microwaves are often classified as radio waves, but they have higher frequencies than other radio waves.
