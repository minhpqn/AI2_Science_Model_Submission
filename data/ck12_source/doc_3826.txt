If the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals ( aa ) is 0.04, what is the value of q ?
What is the value of p ?
Use the values of p and q from question 2 to calculate the frequency of the heterozygote genotype ( Aa ).
Forces of Evolution
List processes that change gene frequencies of a population.
Describe how mutations alter allele frequencies.
Define gene flow.
Explain genetic drift.
Compare the bottleneck effect to the founder effect.
How do a population's genes change?
Remember, without change, there cannot be evolution.
Together, the forces that change a population's gene frequencies are the driving mechanisms behind evolution.
Forces of Evolution
The conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are unlikely to be met in real populations.
The Hardy-Weinberg theorem also describes populations in which allele frequencies are not changing.
By definition, such populations are not evolving.
How does the theorem help us understand evolution in the real world?
From the theorem, we can infer factors that cause allele frequencies to change.
These factors are the "forces of evolution." There are four such forces: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection.
Natural selection will be discussed in the "Natural Selection" concept.
