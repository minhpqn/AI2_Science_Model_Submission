Q:
If a different hair dryer is plugged into a 120-volt circuit that carries 10 amps of current.
What is the power of the other hair dryer?
A:
Substitute these values in the power equation:
Power = 10 amps × 120 volts = 1200 watts, or 1.2 kilowatts
Electrical Energy Use
Did you ever wonder how much electrical energy it takes to use an appliance such as a hair dryer?
Electrical energy use depends on the power of the appliance and how long it is used.
It can be calculated with this equation:
Electrical Energy = Power × Time
If Miranda uses her 1.8-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2 hours, how much electrical energy does she use?
Electrical Energy = 1.8 kilowatts × 0.2 hours = 0.36 kilowatt-hours
Electrical energy use is typically expressed in kilowatt-hours, as in this example.
How much energy is this?
One kilowatt-hour equals 3.6 million joules of energy.
Q:
Suppose Miranda were to use a 1.2-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2 hours.
How much electrical energy would she use then?
A:
