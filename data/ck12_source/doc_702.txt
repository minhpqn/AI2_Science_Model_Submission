This can be determined using the mirror and magnification equations.
For convex mirrors, the reflecting surface is on the outside of the sphere, placing the center of curvature and the focal point on the opposite side of the mirror from the object.
Light rays that approach the mirror aimed at the focal point will be reflected parallel to the principal axis.
Light rays that come to the mirror parallel to the principal axis reflect as if they came from the focal point.
Since the focal point is on the opposite side of the mirror from the object, the focal length is assigned a negative number.
Both the mirror equation and the magnification equation are true with convex mirrors.
