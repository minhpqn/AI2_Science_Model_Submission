The nucleus emits a beta particle and energy.
A beta particle is either an electron (beta-minus decay) or a positron (beta-plus decay).
In beta-minus decay, a neutron breaks down to a proton and an electron, and the electron is emitted from the nucleus.
In beta-plus decay, a proton breaks down to a neutron and a positron, and the positron is emitted from the nucleus.
Balanced nuclear equations show how the numbers of protons and neutrons change in beta decay.
Beta radiation is harmful to living things.

Fill in the missing subscript and superscript in this nuclear equation to balance it:
\mathrm{^{14}_?
C} â†’ \mathrm{^?_7 N} + \mathrm{^0_{-1} e} + energy
Does the equation represent beta-minus or beta-plus decay?
How do you know?
