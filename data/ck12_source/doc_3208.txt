The Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of sound waves that occurs when the source of the sound waves is moving relative to a stationary listener. (It can also occur when the sound source is stationary and the listener is moving.) The Figure below shows how the Doppler effect occurs.
The sound waves from the police car siren travel outward in all directions.
Because the car is racing forward (to the left), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it.
Sound waves that are closer together have a higher frequency, and sound waves that are farther apart have a lower frequency.
The frequency of sound waves, in turn, determines the pitch of the sound.
Sound waves with a higher frequency produce sound with a higher pitch, and sound waves with a lower frequency produce sound with a lower pitch.

Diagram illustrating how the Doppler effect works.
Experiencing the Doppler Effect
As the car approaches listener A, the sound waves get closer together, increasing their frequency.
This listener hears the pitch of the siren get higher.
As the car speeds away from listener B, the sound waves get farther apart, decreasing their frequency.
This listener hears the pitch of the siren get lower.
You can experience the Doppler effect with a moving siren in the following animation:
Q:
What will the siren sound like to listener A after the police car passes him?
A:
The siren will suddenly get lower in pitch because the sound waves will be much more spread out and have a lower frequency.
The Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of sound waves that occurs when the source of the sound waves is moving relative to a stationary listener.
As the source of sound waves approaches a listener, the sound waves get closer together, increasing their frequency and the pitch of the sound.
