When do rolling and sliding friction occur in the simulations?
How does the surface affect the distance it takes for vehicle to stop?
What role does speed of the vehicle play in stopping time?
How is the amount of time spent sliding controlled in the simulations?
How does it affect the ability of the vehicle to stop?
List four types of friction.
You can move heavy boxes by sliding them over the ground.
Or you can put them on a dolly, like the one in the Figure below , and then roll them over the ground.
Explain which way makes it easier to move the boxes.
Practice problem illustrating how reducing friction can save energy
What is a fluid?
Give an original example of fluid friction.
Describe Earthâ€™s gravity.
Relate gravity and weight.
Long, long ago, when the universe was still young, an incredible force caused dust and gas particles to pull together to form the objects in our solar system.
From the smallest moon to our enormous sun, this force created not only our solar system, but all the solar systems in all the galaxies of the universe.
The force is gravity.
Gravity has traditionally been defined as a force of attraction between things that have mass.
According to this conception of gravity, anything that has mass, no matter how small, exerts gravity on other matter.
Gravity can act between objects that are not even touching.
