(86 °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 = 30 °C
Temperature is the average kinetic energy of particles of matter.
A thermometer can measure temperature with a liquid that expands when it gets warmer and contracts when it gets cooler
The SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale.
Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales are also commonly used.
You can use conversion factors to convert temperatures between the different scales.

What is temperature?
Explain how the thermometer pictured in this article measures temperature.
Assume that the temperature outside is 293 Kelvin but you’re familiar only with the Fahrenheit scale.
