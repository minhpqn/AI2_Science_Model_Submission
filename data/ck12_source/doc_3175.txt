Based on the animation in the article, draw a sketch to show what happens to particles of the medium in a transverse wave.
Include arrows to show the direction the particles move and the direction the wave travels.
What is a transverse wave?
Sketch a transverse wave and label the crests and troughs.
Infer how S waves might affect structures such as buildings.
Describe a longitudinal wave.
Identify compressions and rarefactions of a longitudinal wave.
Define P waves.
You’ve probably played with Slinky spring toys like these.
They’re simple toys, but they can move in very interesting ways.
Pushing in on the end of a spring toy, for example, gives it energy that moves through the spring in a longitudinal wave.
What Is a Longitudinal Wave?
A longitudinal wave is a type of mechanical wave.
A mechanical wave is a wave that travels through matter, called the medium.
In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate in a direction that is parallel to the direction that the wave travels.
You can see this in the Figure below .
The person’s hand pushes and pulls on one end of the spring.
The energy of this disturbance passes through the coils of the spring to the other end.
