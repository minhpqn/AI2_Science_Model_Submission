Imagine you're in a submersible going to the bottom of the ocean.
The first thing you realize is that it's not light for very long.
The next thing is that many of the creatures that live just below where it's light create their own light.
This is called bioluminescence .
What is the advantage of being able to light up if you live in the dark?
In addition to the amount of salts, other conditions in ocean water vary from place to place.
One is the amount of nutrients in the water.
Another is the amount of sunlight that reaches the water.
These conditions depend mainly on two factors: distance from shore and depth of water.
Oceans are divided into zones ( Figure below ) based on these two factors.
The ocean floor makes up another zone.

Distance from shore and depth of water define ocean zones.
Which zone is on the ocean floor?
Zones Based on Distance from Shore
There are three main ocean zones based on distance from shore.
They are the intertidal zone , neritic zone , and oceanic zone .
Distance from shore influences how many nutrients are in the water.
Why?
Most nutrients are washed into ocean water from land.
