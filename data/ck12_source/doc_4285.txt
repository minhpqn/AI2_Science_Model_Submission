Structure and Function of Flatworms
Flatworms range in length from about 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) to more than 20 meters (66 feet).
They have a flat body because they do not have a coelom or even a pseudocoelom.
They also lack a respiratory system.
Instead, their cells exchange gases by diffusion directly with the environment.
They have an incomplete digestive system.
Flatworms reflect several major evolutionary advances in invertebrates.
