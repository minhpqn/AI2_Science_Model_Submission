Distinguish between bacteria and archaea.
Describe how archaea obtain energy.
What organisms can grow in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park?
In the 1970s, a new group of organisms was identified.
Unlike other organisms, these organisms could thrive in temperatures near 100ÂºC, the boiling point of water!
This new group of organisms was named archaea.
What are Archaea?
For many years, archaea were classified as bacteria.
Like the bacteria, archaea lacked a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles and, therefore, were prokaryotic cells.
However, when scientists compared the DNA of the two prokaryotes, they found that there were distinct differences.
They concluded that there must be two distinct types of prokaryotes, which they named archaea and bacteria.
Even though the two groups might seem similar, archaea have many features that distinguish them from bacteria:
The cell walls of archaea are distinct from those of bacteria.
While bacteria have cell walls made up of the polymer peptidoglycan, most archaea do not have peptidoglycan in their cell walls.
The plasma membranes of the archaea are also made up of lipids that are distinct from those in bacteria.
The ribosomal proteins of the archaea are similar to those in eukaryotic cells, not those in bacteria.
Although archaea and bacteria share some fundamental differences, they are still similar in many ways:
They both are single-celled, microscopic organisms that can come in a variety of shapes ( Figure below ).
