If her friend, James, were at the bottom and shined a light back, hitting the same spot as Nishaâ€™s, how far from the edge would he have to be so that the light never leaves the water?
You are to design an experiment to determine the index of refraction of an unknown liquid.
You have a small square container of the liquid, the sides of which are made of transparent thin plastic.
In addition you have a screen, laser, ruler and protractors.
Design the experiment.
Give a detailed procedure; include a diagram of the experiment.
Tell which equations you would use and give some sample calculations.
Finally, tell in detail what level of accuracy you can expect and explain the causes of lab error in order of importance.

Total Internal Reflection
Describe total internal reflection and the critical angle.
Derive the critical angle and solve for it in real life applications.
Students will learn about total internal reflection.
More specifically, they will learn what the critical angle is, how it is derived and how to solve for it in real life applications.
\theta_C = sin^{-1}\frac{n_2}{n_1} \;  ; where  \theta_C  is the critical angle, n 1 is the index of refraction of the material where the light emanates from and n 2 is the index of the material outside.
Guidance Total internal reflection occurs when light goes from a slow (high index of refraction) medium to a fast (low index of refraction) medium.
With total internal reflection, light refracts so much it actually refracts back into the first medium.
