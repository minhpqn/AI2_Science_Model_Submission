It is useful to know the percent of water contained within a hydrate.
The sample problem below demonstrates the procedure.
Sample Problem One:
Percent of Water in a Hydrate
Find the percent water in cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate, CoCl 2 â€¢6H 2 O.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
The mass of water in the hydrate is the coefficient (6) multiplied by the molar mass of H 2 O.  The molar mass of the hydrate is the molar mass of the CoCl 2 plus the mass of water.
mass of H 2 O in 1 mol hydrate = 108.12 g
molar mass of hydrate = 237.95 g/mol
percent H 2 O = ? %
Calculate the percent by mass of water by dividing the mass of H 2 O in 1 mole of the hydrate by the molar mass of the hydrate and multiplying by 100%.
Step 2:
Calculate.
\% \ \text{H}_2\text{O}=\frac{108.12 \ \text{g H}_2 \text{O}}{237.95 \ \text{g}} \times 100 \%=45.44 \% \ \text{H}_2\text{O}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Nearly half of the mass of the hydrate is composed of water molecules within the crystal.
