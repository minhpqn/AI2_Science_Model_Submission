We just assume that we will get electric power when we connect a plug to an electrical outlet.
The wire that comprises that outlet is almost always copper, a material that conducts electricity well.
The unique properties of the solid copper allow electrons to flow freely through the wire and into whatever device we connect it to.
Then we can enjoy music, television, work on the computer, or whatever other activity we want to undertake.
Classes of Crystalline Solids
Crystalline substances can be described by the types of particles in them and the types of chemical bonding that takes place between the particles.
There are four types of crystals: (1) ionic , (2) metallic , (3) covalent network, and (4) molecular .
Properties and several examples of each type are listed in the following table and are described in the Table below .

Ionic crystals -- The ionic crystal structure consists of alternating positively-charged cations and negatively-charged anions (see Figure below ).
The ions may either be monatomic or polyatomic.
Generally, ionic crystals form from a combination of Group 1 or 2 metals and Group 16 or 17 nonmetals or nonmetallic polyatomic ions.
Ionic crystals are hard and brittle and have high melting points.
Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity as solids, but do conduct when molten or in aqueous solution.
Ionic crystals have high melting points and strong intermolecular forces
Metallic crystals -- Metallic crystals consist of metal cations surrounded by a “sea” of mobile valence electrons (see Figure below ).
