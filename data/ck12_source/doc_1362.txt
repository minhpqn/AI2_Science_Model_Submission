Thick lava doesn’t flow easily.
It may block the vent of a volcano.
If the lava traps a lot of gas, the pressure builds up.
After the pressure becomes greater and greater, the volcano finally explodes.
Ash and pyroclasts shoot up into the air.
Pumice, with small holes in solid rock, shows where gas bubbles were when the rock was still molten.
Fluid lava flows down mountainsides.
The rock that the flow becomes depends on which type of lava it is and where it cools.
The three types of flows are a’a, pahoehoe, and pillow lava.
A’a lava is the thickest of the non-explosive lavas.
A'a forms a thick and brittle crust, which is torn into rough, rubbly pieces.
The solidified surface is angular, jagged, and sharp ( Figure below ).
A'a can spread over large areas as the lava continues to flow underneath.
Solidified A'a flow in Hawaii
A'a flows can also be found in Hawaii and are much sharper and more jagged than pahoehoe.
Pāhoehoe lava is thinner than a'a, and flows more readily.
Its surface looks more wrinkly and smooth.
Pāhoehoe lava flows in a series of lobes that form strange, twisted shapes and natural rock sculptures ( Figure below ).
Pāhoehoe lava can form lava tubes.
The outer layer of the lava flow cools and solidifies.
