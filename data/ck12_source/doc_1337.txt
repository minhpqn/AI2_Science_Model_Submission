Finding an earthquake epicenter using 3 seismographs
Seismographs in Portland, San Francisco, and Salt Lake City are used to find an earthquake epicenter.
Of course, it's been a long time since scientists drew circles to locate an earthquake epicenter.
This is all done digitally now. but it's a great way to learn the basics of locating an epicenter.
To find an earthquake epicenter you need at least three seismographs.
Find the distance from each seismograph to the earthquake epicenter.
The interception of the three circles is the epicenter.
