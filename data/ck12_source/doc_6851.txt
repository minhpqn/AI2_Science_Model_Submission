All hexapods have three pairs (six appendages) of walking appendages.
Crustacea, which includes lobsters, crabs, barnacles, crayfish, and shrimp.
These animals dominate the ocean, and usually have a set of anterior appendages that are modified as mandibles, which function in grasping, biting, and chewing food.
Spiders are one type of arthropod

Characteristics of Arthropods
Characteristics of arthropods include:
A segmented body ( Figure below ) with a head, a thorax, and abdomen segments.
Appendages on at least one segment.
They can be used for feeding, sensory reception, defense, and locomotion.
In addition to legs, antennas and mouth parts are considered modified appendages.
A nervous system.
A hard exoskeleton made of chitin, which gives them physical protection and resistance to drying out.
In order to grow, arthropods shed this outer covering in a process called molting .
An open circulatory system with hemolymph , a blood-like fluid.
A series of hearts move the hemolymph into the body cavity where it comes in direct contact with the tissues.
Hemolymph is involved with oxygen distribution.
A complete digestive system with a mouth and an anus.
Aquatic arthropods use gills to exchange gases.
These gills have a large surface area in contact with the water, so they can absorb more oxygen.
