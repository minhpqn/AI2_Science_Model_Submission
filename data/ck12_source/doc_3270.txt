A:
No, an image isnâ€™t an actual object.
It is focused rays of light that make a copy of an object, like a picture projected on a screen.
Regular and Diffuse Reflection
If a surface is extremely smooth, as it is in a mirror, then the image formed by reflection is sharp and clear.
This is called regular reflection (also called specular reflection).
However, if the surface is even slightly rough or bumpy, an image may not form, or if there is an image, it is blurry or fuzzy.
This is called diffuse reflection.
Q:
Look at the boats and their images in the Figure below .
Which one represents regular reflection, and which one represents diffuse reflection?
A:
Reflection of the boat on the left is regular reflection.
The water is smooth and the image is sharp and clear.
Reflection of the boat on the right is diffuse reflection.
The water has ripples and the image is blurry and wavy.
Regular and diffuse reflection
In the Figure below , you can see how both types of reflection occur.
Waves of light are represented by arrows called rays.
Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays.
