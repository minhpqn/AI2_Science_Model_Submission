This type of mirror distorts your features in silly ways.
Do you know how a mirror like this one works?
Physics, which is a branch of physical science, can explain it.
The Scope of Physics
Physics is the study of energy, matter, and their interactions.
It’s a very broad field because it is concerned with matter and energy at all levels—from the most fundamental particles of matter to the entire universe.
Some people would even argue that physics is the study of everything!
Important concepts in physics include motion, forces such as magnetism and gravity, and forms of energy such as light, sound, and electrical energy.
Q:
How do you think physics explains the distorted images formed by a funhouse mirror?
A:
Physics explains how energy interacts with matter.
In this case, for example, physics explains how visible light reflects from mirrors to form images.
Most mirrors, such as bathroom mirrors, have a flat surface.
Light reflected from a flat mirror forms an image that looks the same as the object in front of it.
Funhouse mirrors, like the one pictured above, are different.
They have a curved surface that reflects light at different angles.
This explains why the images they form are distorted.
