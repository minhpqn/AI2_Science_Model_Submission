Why is preserving the rainforest important?
Preserving the rainforest is important for many reasons.
But one reason conservation efforts have focused here is that the rainforest is home to more species of insects, amphibians, and birds than anywhere else on the planet.
This wide diversity of life is called biodiversity.
Importance of Biodiversity
Biodiversity is a measurement of the amount of variation of the species in a given area.
More specifically, biodiversity can be defined as the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur.
A place such as a coral reef has many different species of plants and animals.
That means the coral reef is a ecosystem with high biodiversity ( Figure below ).
Because of its biodiversity, the rainforest shown above is an ecosystem with extreme importance.
Why is biodiversity so important?
In addition to maintaining the health and stability of the ecosystem, the diversity of life provides us with many benefits.
Extinction is a threat to biodiversity.
Does it matter if we are losing thousands of species each year?
The answer is yes.
It matters even if we consider not only the direct benefits to humans, but also the benefits to the ecosystems.
The health and survival of ecosystems is related to that ecosystem's biodiversity.
