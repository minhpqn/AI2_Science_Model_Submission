The Big Idea
In studying fluids we apply the concepts of force, momentum, and energy — which we have learned previously — to new phenomena.
Since fluids are made from a large number of individual molecules, we have to look at their behavior as an ensemble and not individually.
For this reason, we use the concept of conservation of energy density in place of conservation of energy.
Energy density is energy divided by volume.
Newtonian fluids (the normal type and only type we deal with here) are non-compressible.
This leads to Pascal's and Archimedes' Principles discussed below.
Define the Buoyant force and calculate problems involving buoyancy and Archimedes principle.
Students will learn about the Buoyant force, how to calculate problems involving buoyancy and Archimedes principle.
F_{\text{buoy}}= \rho_{\text{water}} g V_{\text{displaced}} && \text{Archimedes' principle}
Guidance Archimedes’ Principle states that the upward buoyant force on an object in the water is equal to the weight of the displaced volume of water.
The reason for this upward force is that the bottom of the object is at lower depth, and therefore higher pressure, than the top.
If an object has a higher density than the density of water, the weight of the displaced volume will be less than the object’s weight, and the object will sink.
Otherwise, the object will float.
The ratio of an object or substance's density to the density of water is called it's specific gravity.
A simple boat (really a metal box with an open top) is floating at rest in a pond.
The boat is 3 m long, 2 m wide, and has walls 1.5 m high and has an empty mass of 500 kg.
If you begin filling the boat with gravel of density 1922 kg/m 3 at a constant rate of .1 m 3 /s, how long will it be before your boat sinks?
To solve this problem, we're going to start out by determining the maximum mass that the boat can support.
The weight of the maximum mass is equal to the buoyant force when the boat is submerged all the way up the the edge of the side wall.
