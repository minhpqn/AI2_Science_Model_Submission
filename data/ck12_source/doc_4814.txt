RNA consists of a single chain of nucleotides, and DNA consists of two chains of nucleotides.
Bonds form between the bases on the two chains of DNA and hold the chains together ( Figure above ).
There are four different types of bases in a nucleic acid molecule: cytosine (C), adenine (A), guanine (G), and either thymine (T) (in DNA) or uracil (U) (in RNA).
Each type of base bonds with just one other type of base.
Cytosine and guanine always bond together, and adenine and thymine (or uracil) always bond with one another.
The pairs of bases that bond together are called complementary bases .
The binding of complementary bases allows DNA molecules to take their well-known shape, called a double helix .
Figure below shows how two chains of nucleotides form a DNA double helix.
A simplified double helix is illustrated in Figure below .
It shows more clearly how the two chains are intertwined.
The double helix shape forms naturally and is very strong.
Being intertwined, the two chains are difficult to break apart.
This is important given the fundamental role of DNA in all living organisms.
DNA Molecule.
Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases help form the double helix of a DNA molecule.
The letters A, T, G, and C stand for the bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine.
