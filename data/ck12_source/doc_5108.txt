These bacteria are important because they help cycle nitrogen through the environment for other living things to use.
Nitrogen cannot be made by living organisms, so it must be continually recycled.
Organisms need nitrogen to make organic compounds, such as DNA.
Some bacteria depend on other organisms for survival.
For example, some bacteria live in the roots of legumes, such as pea plants ( Figure below ).
The bacteria turn nitrogen-containing molecules into nitrogen that the plant can use.
Meanwhile, the root provides nutrients to the bacteria.
In this relationship, both the bacteria and the plant benefit, so it is known as a mutualism .
Bacteria growing on a soybean root help provide the plant with nitrogen
These mutualistic bacteria-containing nodules on a soybean root help provide the plant with nitrogen.
Other bacteria are parasitic and can cause illness.
In parasitism , the bacteria benefit, and the other organism is harmed.
Harmful bacteria will be discussed in another concept.
Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by performing photosynthesis, decomposing dead organisms and wastes, or breaking down chemical compounds.
Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by establishing close relationships with other organisms, including mutualistic and parasitic relationships.
