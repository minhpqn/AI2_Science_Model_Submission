Both solving crimes and doing science use inductive reasoning.
What Is Inductive Reasoning?
Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many clues, or pieces of evidence.
Many crimes are solved using inductive reasoning.
It is also the hallmark of science and the basis of the scientific method.
Q:
How might the police detective pictured above use inductive reasoning to solve the crime?
A:
The detective might gather clues that provide evidence about the identity of the person who committed the crime.
For example, he might find fingerprints or other evidence left behind by the perpetrator.
The detective might eventually find enough clues to be able to conclude the identity of the most likely suspect.

Inductive Reasoning in Science
A simple example will help you understand how inductive reasoning works in science.
Suppose you grew up on a planet named Quim, where there is no gravity.
In fact, assume youâ€™ve never even heard of gravity.
You travel to Earth (on a student exchange program) and immediately notice things are very different here than on your home planet.
For one thing, when you step out of your spacecraft, you fall directly to the ground.
Then, when you let go of your communications device, it falls to the ground as well.
On Quim, nothing ever falls to the ground.
