Calculate how far muons could travel before half decayed, without using relativity and assuming a speed of 0.999\;\mathrm{c} (i.e. 99.9 % of the speed of light)
Now calculate \gamma , for this muon.
Calculate its 'relativistic' half-life.
Now calculate the distance before half decayed using relativistic half-life and express it in kilometers. (This has been observed experimentally.
This first experimental verification of time dilation was performed by Bruno Rossi at Mt.
Evans, Colorado in 1939.)
An alien spaceship moves past Earth at a speed of .15 \;\mathrm{c} with respect to Earth.
The alien clock ticks off 0.30 seconds between two events on the spaceship.
What will earthbound observers determine the time interval to be?
Suppose your identical twin blasted into space in a space ship and is traveling at a speed of 0.100\;\mathrm{c} .
Your twin performs an experiment which he clocks at 76.0 minutes.
You observe this experiment through a powerful telescope; what duration does the experiment have according to your clock?
Now the opposite happens and you do the 76.0 minute experiment.
How long does the traveling twin think the experiment lasted?
