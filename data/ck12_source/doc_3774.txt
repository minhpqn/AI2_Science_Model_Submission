Nevertheless, as we close the history of early life, reflect once more on the remarkable but often unsung patterns and processes of early evolution.
Often, as humans, we focus our attention on plants and animals, and ignore bacteria.
Our human senses cannot directly perceive the unimaginable variety of single cells, the architecture of organic molecules, or the intricacy of biochemical pathways.
Let your study of early evolution give you a new perspective – a window into the beauty and diversity of unseen worlds, now and throughout Earth’s history.
In addition to the mitochondria that call your 100 trillion cells home, your body contains more bacterial cells than human cells.
You, mitochondria, and your resident bacteria share common ancestry – a continuous history of the gift of life.
The phylogenetic tree of life
The three major domains of life had evolved by 1.5 billion years ago.
Biochemical similarities show that eukaryotes share more recent common ancestors with the Archaea, but our organelles probably descended from bacteria by endosymbiosis.
Eukaryotic cells probably evolved about 2 billion years ago.
Their evolution is explained by endosymbiotic theory.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotic organisms.
Eukaryotic cells would go on to evolve into the diversity of eukaryotes we know today.
