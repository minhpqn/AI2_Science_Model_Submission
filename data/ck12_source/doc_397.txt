Cook meats, poultry, fish, and eggs thoroughly before eating them.
The heat of cooking kills any bacteria the foods may contain, so they cannot make you sick.
Refrigerate cooked food soon after a meal.
Cooked food can be left out for up to two hours before they need to be placed in the cold.
This will prevent the spread of bacteria.
Cooked foods should not be left out all day.
