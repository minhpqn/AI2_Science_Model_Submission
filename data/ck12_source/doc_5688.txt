The peak of the wave
frequency:
Is the number of waves that pass a certain point in a specified amount of time.
trough:
The low point of the wave cycle.
wavelength:
The distance between two successive peaks.
Quantization of Energy
Describe the relationship between the amount of energy absorbed or released by an object and the frequency of the radiation observed.
Every so often you hear a commercial or a news story with the words “quantum leap” in it.
The quantum leap is supposed to be a major breakthrough, a big change, something extraordinarily large.
The reality is far different.
Instead of the big, extravagant change the “quantum” that scientists know about is a very small difference in the location of an electron around a nucleus – hardly an enormous shift at all.
Quantization of Energy
German physicist Max Planck (1858-1947) studied the emission of light by hot objects.
You have likely seen a heated metal object glow an orange-red color (see Figure below ).
A heated object gives off energy in quanta
A heated object may glow different colors.
The atoms in this piece of metal are releasing energy in discrete units called quanta.
Classical physics, which explains the behavior of large, everyday objects, predicted that a hot object would emit electromagnetic energy in a continuous fashion.
