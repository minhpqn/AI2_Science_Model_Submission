They all have radial symmetry .
This means that the body is arranged around a central point.
Echinoderms belong to the phylum Echinodermata .
This phylum includes 7,000 living species.
It is the largest animal phylum without freshwater or land-living members.

Starfish are also known as sea stars.
Characteristics of Echinoderms
As mentioned earlier, echinoderms show radial symmetry.
Other key echinoderm features include an internal skeleton and spines, as well as a few organs and organ systems.
Although echinoderms look like they have a hard exterior, they do not have an external skeleton.
Instead, a thin outer skin covers an internal skeleton made of tiny plates and spines.
This provides rigid support.
Some groups of echinoderms, such as sea urchins ( Figure below ), have spines that protect the organism.
Sea cucumbers use these spines to help them move.

Echinoderms have a unique water vascular system .
This network of fluid-filled tubes helps them to breathe, eat, and move.
