When the azimuthal quantum number l=1 , the sub-level = p .
When the azimuthal quantum number l=2 , the sub-level = d .
When the azimuthal quantum number l=3 , the sub-level = f .
Quantum mechanics also tells us how many orbitals are in each sub-level.
In Bohrâ€™s model, an orbit was a circular path that the electron followed around the nucleus.
In quantum mechanics, an orbital is defined as an area in the electron cloud where the probability of finding the electron is high.
The number of orbitals in an energy level is equal to the square of the principal quantum number.
Hence, energy level 1 will have 1 orbital (1 2 ), energy level 2 will have 4 orbitals (2 2 ), energy level 3 will have 9 orbitals (3 2 ), and energy level 4 will have 16 orbitals (4 2 ).
The  s sub-level has only one orbital.
Each of the  p sub-levels has three orbitals.
The  d sub-levels have five orbitals, and the  f sub-levels have seven orbitals.
If we wished to assign the number of orbitals to the unused sub-levels,  g would have nine orbitals and h would have eleven.
You might note that the number of orbitals in the sub-levels increases by odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \ldots) .
As a result, the single orbital in energy level 1 is the  s orbital.
The four orbitals in energy level 2 are a single  2s orbital and three  2p orbitals.
The nine orbitals in energy level 3 are a single  3s orbital, three  3p orbitals, and five  3d orbitals.
The sixteen orbitals in energy level 4 are the single  4s orbital, three  4p orbitals, five  4d orbitals, and seven  4f orbitals.
