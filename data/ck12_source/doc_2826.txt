You can watch a video about the three types at this URL:  .
alpha particle (2 protons and 2 neutrons) + energy
beta particle (1 electron or 1 positron) + energy
energy (gamma ray)
Both alpha and beta decay change the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus, thereby changing the atom to a different element.
In alpha decay, the nucleus loses two protons.
In beta decay, the nucleus either loses a proton or gains a proton.
In gamma decay, no change in proton number occurs, so the atom does not become a different element.
Q:
If the radioactive element polonium (Po) undergoes alpha decay, what element does it become?
A:
From the periodic table, the atomic number of polonium is 84, so it has 84 protons.
If it loses two protons through alpha decay, it will have 82 protons.
Atoms with 82 protons are the element lead (Pb).
Dangers of Radioactive Decay
The charged particles and energy emitted during radioactive decay can harm living things, but the three types of radioactive decay aren’t equally dangerous.
That’s because they differ in how far they can travel and what they can penetrate.
You can see this in the Figure below and in the animation at the following URL:
Radiation has different levels of penetration
Alpha particles can travel only a few centimeters through air.
