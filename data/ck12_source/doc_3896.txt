Notice the abundance of vegetation mixed with the water.
And of course, where there are plants, there are animals.
Wetlands are considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems.
Plant life found in wetlands includes mangrove, water lilies, cattails, black spruce, cypress, and many others.
Animal life includes many different amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects, and mammals.
Freshwater biomes have water that contains little or no salt.
They include standing and running freshwater biomes.
Standing freshwater biomes include ponds and lakes.
Lakes are generally bigger and deeper than ponds.
Some of the water in lakes is in the aphotic zone, where there is too little sunlight for photosynthesis.
Plankton and plants, such as the duckweed in Figure below , are the primary producers in standing freshwater biomes.
Duckweed and cattails are respectively the primary producers in standing and running freshwater biomes
The pond on the left has a thick mat of duckweed plants.
They cover the surface of the water and use sunlight for photosynthesis.
The cattails on the right grow along a stream bed.
They have tough, slender leaves that can withstand moving water.
Running freshwater biomes include streams and rivers.
Rivers are usually larger than streams.
Streams may start with runoff or water seeping out of a spring.
The water runs downhill and joins other running water to become a stream.
