Animals produce gametes directly through meiosis in organs called gonads.
Gametogenesis differs between the sexes.
In the male, the production of mature sperm cells, or spermatogenesis , results in four haploid gametes, whereas, in the female, the production of a mature egg cell, oogenesis , results in just one mature gamete.
Analogies in the process of maturation of the ovum and the development of the spermatids.
Four haploid spermatids form during meiosis from the primary spermatocyte, whereas only 1 mature ovum, or egg forms during meiosis from the primary oocyte.
Three polar bodies may form during oogenesis.
These polar bodies will not form mature gametes.
From gametogonium (plural, gametogonia ), male and female gametes develop differently - males by spermatogenesis and females by oogenesis.
A gametogonium is a germ cell that divides into gametocytes during gametogenesis.
Male gametogonia are called spermatogonia , and female gametogonia are called oogonia .
However, the following pattern is common for both oogonia and soermatogonia (chromosome numbers depict human chromosomes):
During spermatogenesis, spermatogonia (singular, spermatogonium ) form primary spermatocytes by mitosis.
These cells go through the first cell division of meiosis to produce secondary spermatocytes.
These are haploid cells.
Secondary spermatocytes then quickly complete the meiotic division to become spermatids , which are also haploid cells.
The four haploid cells produced from meiosis develop a flagellum tail and compact head piece to become mature sperm cells, capable of swimming and fertilizing an egg.
The compact head, which has lost most of its cytoplasm, is key in the formation of a streamlined shape.
The middle piece of the sperm, connecting the head to the tail, contains many mitochondria, providing energy to the cell.
The sperm cell essentially contributes only DNA to the zygote.
A human sperm is a tiny cell with a tail.
