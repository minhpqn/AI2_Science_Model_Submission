Sympatric Speciation in Hawthorn Flies.
Hawthorn flies are diverging from one species into two.
As this example shows, behaviors as well as physical traits may evolve and lead to speciation.
Isolating mechanisms are discussed in the following video
New species arise in the process of speciation.
Allopatric speciation occurs when some members of a species become geographically separated.
They then evolve genetic differences.
If the differences prevent them from interbreeding with the original species, a new species has evolved.
Sympatric speciation occurs without geographic separation.
Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.
In terms of a gene pool, what is a species?
What is speciation?
Give three examples of events that may cause geographic isolation.
What can happen to a population by geographic isolation?
Describe how allopatric speciation occurs.
Why is sympatric speciation less likely to occur than allopatric speciation?
Give an example of coevolution.
How can a predator, such as a wolf, influence evolution?
Wolves hunt caribou, chasing them down to capture them.
The slower caribou are more likely to become lunch or dinner, leaving the faster individuals to reproduce.
