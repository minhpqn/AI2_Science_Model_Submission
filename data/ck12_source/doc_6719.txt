A sharp knife has much less area of contact, so the pressure is greater (pressure is inversely proportional to area).
a. 0.008 \ m^2 b. 75 kPa
estimates will vary, but expect about a force five times larger for 'tippy toes' due to the smaller area.
Discuss in class.
Types of Forces
List and describe types of common forces.
The various types of common forces are discussed and analyzed.
\mathrm{Common~Forces}\begin{cases}F_g = m g & \text{Gravity}\\\F_N & \text{Normal force: acts perpendicular to surfaces}\\\F_T & \text{Force of tension in strings and wires}\\\F_{sp}= -k \Delta x & \text{Force of spring stretched a distance } \Delta x \text{ from equilibrium}\end{cases}
Often, objects experience a force that pushes them into another object, but once the objects are in contact they do not any move closer together.
For instance, when you stand on the surface of the earth you are obviously not accelerating toward its center.
According to Newton's Laws, there must be a force opposing the earth's gravity acting on you, so that the net force on you is zero.
The same also applies for your gravity acting on the earth.
We call such a force the Normal Force .
The normal force acts between any two surfaces in contact, balancing what ever force is pushing the objects together.
It is actually electromagnetic in nature (like other contact forces), and arises due to the repulsion of atoms in the two objects.
Here is an illustration of the Normal force on a block sitting on earth:
Another force that often opposes gravity is known as tension .
This force is provided by wires and strings when they hold objects above the earth.
Like the Normal Force, it is electromagnetic in nature and arises due to the intermolecular bonds in the wire or string:
If the object is in equilibrium, tension must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to gravity.
