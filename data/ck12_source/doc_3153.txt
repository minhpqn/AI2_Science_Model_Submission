What is convection?
Describe how convection occurs and why convection currents form.
Add arrows representing convection currents to the room in the Figure below to show how thermal energy moves from the radiator to the rest of the room.
Label areas of the room that are warm and cool.
Exercise for drawing direction of convection currents created by a radiator
Describe how thermal energy is transferred by thermal radiation.
Give examples of thermal radiation.
Someone is warming his hands over a bonfire.
He doesn’t have to touch the fire to feel its warmth.
How is warmth from the fire transferred to his hands?
In this article, you’ll find out.
Introducing Thermal Radiation
The bonfire from the opening image has a lot of thermal energy.
Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat.
Thermal energy from the bonfire is transferred to the hands by thermal radiation.
Thermal radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves that can travel through air or even through empty space, as shown in the Figure below .
When the waves of thermal energy reach objects, they transfer the energy to the objects, causing them to warm up.
This is how the fire warms the hands of someone sitting near the bonfire.
This is also how the sun’s energy reaches Earth and heats its surface.
Without the energy radiated from the sun, Earth would be too cold to support life as we know it.
