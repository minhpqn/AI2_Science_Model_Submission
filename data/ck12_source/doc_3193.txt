Diagram illustrating diffraction
For a given type of waves, such as sound waves, how much the waves diffract depends on the size of the obstacle (or opening in the obstacle) and the wavelength of the waves.
The Figure below shows how the amount of diffraction is affected by the size of the opening in a barrier.
Note that the wavelength of the wave is the distance between the vertical lines.

Three ways that waves may interact with matter are reflection, refraction, and diffraction.
Reflection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface that they cannot pass through.
Refraction occurs when waves bend as they enter a new medium at an angle and start traveling at a different speed.
Diffraction occurs when waves spread out as they travel around obstacles or through openings in obstacles.
