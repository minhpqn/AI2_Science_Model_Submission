They include all animals and fungi. (Fungi don't really “eat”; they absorb nutrients from other organisms.) They also include many bacteria and even a few plants, such as the pitcher plant shown in Figure below .
Consumers are also called heterotrophs.
Heterotrophs are classified by what they eat:
Herbivores consume producers such as plants or algae.
They are a necessary link between producers and other consumers.
Examples include deer, rabbits, and mice.
Carnivores consume animals.
Examples include lions, polar bears, hawks, frogs, salmon, and spiders.
Carnivores that are unable to digest plants and must eat only animals are called obligate carnivores.
Other carnivores can digest plants but do not commonly eat them.
Omnivores consume both plants and animals.
They include humans, pigs, brown bears, gulls, crows, and some species of fish.
A pitcher plant is different from other plants because it is not a producer, it is a consuemer
Pitcher Plant.
Virtually all plants are producers.
This pitcher plant is an exception.
It consumes insects.
It traps them in a sticky substance in its “pitcher.” Then it secretes enzymes that break down the insects and release nutrients.
Which type of consumer is a pitcher plant?
When organisms die, they leave behind energy and matter in their remains.
