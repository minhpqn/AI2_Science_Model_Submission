Using the quadratic formula will give you two answers; be careful to think about the answer you get - does it make sense?
To solve the problem, we plug the speed and time into the equation for distance:
d_{\text{horizontal}} = (0.816 \ \text{s})(56.6 \ \text{m/s}) = 46.2 \ \text{m}
To calculate projectile motion at an angle, first resolve the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical components.
Analysis of projectile motion involves dealing with two motions independently.
Vertical components will always have the acceleration of gravity acting on them.
Vertical motion is symmetrical - the distance and time are the same in the rise as in the fall; the final velocity will have the same magnitude as the initial velocity but in the opposite direction.
Horizontal components will never be effected by gravity; it is constant velocity motion.
The following video shows the famous "shoot the monkey" demonstration.
The idea is that if a cannon aimed at a monkey, and fired at exactly the moment the monkey drops, the monkey will always be hit by the cannon ball.
The results of the demonstration may be surprising given that it seems that the projectile will miss the monkey because the monkey will fall under the cannon ball.

What is the cannon ball in this video?
What is used as the monkey in this video?
Does the velocity of the cannon ball matter, or will it hit the monkey at any velocity?
A player kicks a football from ground level with a velocity of magnitude 27.0 m/s at an angle of 30.0° above the horizontal.
Find the time the ball is in the air.
Find the maximum height of the ball.
Find the horizontal distance the ball travels.
A person standing on top of a 30.0 m high building throws a ball with an initial velocity of 20. m/s at an angle of 20.0° below horizontal.
