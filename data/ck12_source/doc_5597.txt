Hold an ice cube in your hand and it feels cold.
Why?
The particles of matter in a hot object are moving much faster than the particles of matter in a cold object.
An object’s kinetic energy is the energy due to motion.
The particles of matter that make up the hot stove have a greater amount of kinetic energy than those in the ice cube.
Temperature and Temperature Scales
Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter.
In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is.
Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry.
When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material.
Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased.
Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.
Charcoal and snow have two very different temperatures
The glowing charcoal on the left represents high kinetic energy, while the snow and ice on the right are of much lower kinetic energy.
The first thermometers were glass and contained alcohol, which expanded and contracted as the temperature changed.
The German scientist, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit used mercury in the tube, an idea put forth by Ismael Boulliau.
The Fahrenheit scale was first developed in 1724 and tinkered with for some time after that.
The main problem with this scale is the arbitrary definitions of temperature.
The freezing point of water was defined as 32°F and the boiling point as 212°F.
The Fahrenheit scale is typically not used for scientific purposes.
