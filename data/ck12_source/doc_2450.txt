Air pressure is greater in box B.
That’s because there are more air particles in box B to bump into each other and into the sides of the container.
Therefore, the particles in box B exert more force on a given area.
Pressure in the Atmosphere
We live in a “sea” of air called the atmosphere.
Can you feel the air in the atmosphere pressing against you?
Not usually, but air actually exerts a lot of pressure because there’s so much of it.
The atmosphere rises high above Earth’s surface, so it contains a huge number of gas particles.
Most of them are concentrated close to Earth’s surface because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them.
As a result, air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude.
The Figure below shows how air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere.
In the graph, air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar (mb).
The SI unit of pressure is newton per square centimeter (N/cm 2 ).
Graph showing pressure by altitude
Q:
The top of Mount Everest is almost 9 km above sea level.
What is the pressure of the atmosphere at this altitude?
A:
Air pressure at the top of Mount Everest is about 260 mb.
This is only about 25 percent of air pressure at sea level, which is 1013.2 mb.
