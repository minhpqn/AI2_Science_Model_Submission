You inherit one chromosome of each pair of homologues from your mother and the other one from your father.
Sexual reproduction is the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of multicellular organisms, including almost all animals and plants.
Fertilization joins two haploid gametes into a diploid zygote, the first cell of a new organism.
The zygote enters G 1 of the first cell cycle, and the organism begins to grow and develop through mitosis and cell division.
During meiosis the number of chromosomes is reduced from a diploid number ( 2n ) to a haploid number ( n ).
During fertilization, haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes ( 2n ) is restored.

diploid :
The state of a cell containing two sets of chromosomes; in human somatic cells, two sets is 46 (23 pairs) chromosomes, 2n
fertilization :
The joining of gametes during reproduction.
gamete :
A sexually reproducing organismâ€™s reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg cells.
haploid :
The state of a cell containing one set of chromosomes; in human gametes, one set is 23 chromosomes, n .
homologous chromosomes :
A pair of chromosomes (one from each parent) consisting of two chromosomes that are similar in size, shape, and genes; also known as homologues.
meiosis :
A type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes; forms gametes.
