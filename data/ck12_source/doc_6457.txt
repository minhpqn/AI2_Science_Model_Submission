The oxidation number of copper decreases from +2 to This result is in accordance with the activity series.
Iron is above copper in the series, so will be more likely to form Fe 2+ while converting the Cu 2+ to metallic copper (Cu 0 ).
A loss of negatively-charged electrons corresponds to an increase in oxidation number, while a gain of electrons corresponds to a decrease in oxidation number.
Therefore, the element or ion that is oxidized undergoes an increase in oxidation number.
The element or ion that is reduced undergoes a decrease in oxidation number.
The Table below summarizes the processes of oxidation and reduction.

Identifying Oxidation and Reduction
Use changes in oxidation number to determine which atoms are oxidized and which atoms are reduced in the following reaction.
Identify the oxidizing and reducing agent.
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)+3\text{CO}(g) \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}(s)+3\text{CO}_2(g)
