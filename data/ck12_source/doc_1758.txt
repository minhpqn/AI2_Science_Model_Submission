Short-Term Climate Change
Learn how El Niño and La Niña differ from normal conditions.
What are short term climate changes?
El Niño and La Niña bring about dramatic changes in climate for a year or two.
In some locations, one brings rain and the other brings drought.
In California, for example, El Niño years are full of snow and rain.
La Niña years tend toward drought.
These variations can bring tremendous changes to living creatures.
Humans are also affected; for example, erosion from storms may be very high some years.
