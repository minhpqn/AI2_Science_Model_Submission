Refer to the examples on the chalkboard in the Figure below as you read the following steps.
Follow the steps in the sequence listed here to convert a number to scientific notation.
Follow the steps in the reverse order to convert a number from scientific notation.
Move the decimal point left or right until you reach the last nonzero digit.
This new decimal number is a in a × 10 b .
Count how many places you moved the decimal point in Step 1.
This number is b in a × 10 b .
Did you move the decimal point left (first example in the Figure below )?
If so, b is positive.
Did you move the decimal point right (second example in the Figure below )?
If so, b is negative.
Drawing of how to use scientific notation
These two examples show how to convert large and small numbers to scientific notation.
Q:
Apply the steps above to write 450,000 in scientific notation.
A:
The unwritten decimal point in this number follows the last zero.
Move the decimal point from this position to the left and stop just before the last digit, giving you 4.5 for a .
The decimal point was moved five places to the left, so b is 5.
In scientific notation the number is 4.5 × 10 5 .
