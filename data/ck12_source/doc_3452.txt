List significant polysaccharides.
Identify the role of significant polysaccharides.
Sugar.
Does this look like biological energy?
As a child, you may have been told that sugar is bad for you.
Well, that's not exactly true.
Essentially, carbohydrates are made of sugar, from a single sugar molecule to thousands of sugar molecules attached together.
Why?
One reason is to store energy.
But that does not mean you should eat it by the spoonful.
Carbohydrates are the most common type of organic compound.
A carbohydrate is an organic compound such as sugar or starch, and is used to store energy.
Like most organic compounds, carbohydrates are built of small, repeating units that form bonds with each other to make a larger molecule.
In the case of carbohydrates, the small repeating units are called monosaccharides.
Carbohydrates contain only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Monosaccharides and Disaccharides
A monosaccharide is a simple sugar such as fructose or glucose.
Fructose is found in fruits, whereas glucose generally results from the digestion of other carbohydrates.
Glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) is used for energy by the cells of most organisms, and is a product of photosynthesis.
