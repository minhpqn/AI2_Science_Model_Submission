One continental margin of North America is an active margin.
The other is a passive margin.
Can you guess which is which?
Map of the North American plate and its surrounding plates
The North American plate and the plates that surround it.
If a continental margin is near a plate boundary, it is an active margin .
The continental margin of western North America is near a set of plate boundaries.
There are convergent boundaries, like where there is subduction off of the Pacific Northwest.
There is a transform boundary, the San Andreas Fault.
The small amount of the North American continent that is not on the North American Plate is across the San Andreas Fault.
It is on the Pacific Plate.
Western North America has a lot of volcanoes and earthquakes.
Mountains line the region.
California, with its volcanoes and earthquakes, is an important part of this active margin ( Figure below ).
Big Sur is an active margin
Big Sur, in central California, has beautiful cliff-lined beaches.
There are no volcanoes and very few earthquakes on the eastern edge of North America.
The continental margin is a smooth transition from continental to oceanic lithosphere.
The continental margin there becomes oceanic lithosphere, but both are on the North American Plate.
There is no plate boundary.
