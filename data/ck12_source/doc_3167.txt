Explain how an internal combustion engine works.
Describe how kinetic energy from an internal combustion engine is used to turn the wheels of a car.
This racecar isnâ€™t really burning up the road.
The flames were added to show that the car is zooming down the road at a high rate of speed.
A racecar can move so fast because it has a powerful combustion engine.
Introducing Combustion Engines
A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work.
In a car, the engine does the work of providing kinetic energy that turns the wheels.
The combustion engine in a car is a type of engine called an internal combustion engine. (Another type of combustion engine is an external combustion engine.)
How an Internal Combustion Engine Works
An internal combustion engine burns fuel internally, or inside the engine.
This type of engine is found not only in cars but in most other motor vehicles as well.
The engine works in a series of steps, which keep repeating.
You can follow the steps in the Figure below .
