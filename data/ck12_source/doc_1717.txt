These “rules” help meteorologists forecast the weather.
For example, low pressure is likely to bring stormy weather.
So if a center of low pressure is moving your way, you can expect a storm.
People often complain when the weather forecast is wrong.
Weather forecasts today, however, are much more accurate than they were just 20 years ago.
Scientists who study and forecast the weather are called meteorologists.
How do they predict the weather?
The first thing they need is data.
Their data comes from various instruments.
Weather instruments measure weather conditions.
One of the most important conditions is air pressure, which is measured with a barometer ( Figure below ).
There are also a number of other commonly used weather instruments ( Figure below ):
A thermometer measures temperature.
An anemometer measures wind speed.
A rain gauge measures the amount of rain.
A hygrometer measures humidity.
A wind vane shows wind direction.
A snow gauge measures the amount of snow.

The greater the air pressure outside the tube, the higher the mercury rises inside the tube.
