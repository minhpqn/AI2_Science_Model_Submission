It also provides services to entire ecosystems.
Economic Benefits of Biodiversity
The diversity of species provides humans with a wide range of economic benefits:
Wild plants and animals maintain a valuable pool of genetic variation .
This is important because domestic species are genetically uniform.
This puts them at great risk of dying out due to disease.
Other organisms provide humans with many different products.
Timber, fibers, adhesives, dyes, and rubber are just a few.
Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment.
When the peregrine falcon nearly went extinct, for example, it warned us of the dangers of DDT.
More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from wild species.
Only a fraction of species have yet been studied for their medical potential.
Other living things provide inspiration for engineering and technology.
For example, the car design in Figure below was based on a fish.
How biodiversity benefits humans
From flowers to fish, biodiversity benefits humans in many ways.
Ecosystem Services of Biodiversity
Biodiversity generally increases the productivity and stability of ecosystems .
It helps ensure that at least some species will survive environmental change.
It also provides many other ecosystem services.
