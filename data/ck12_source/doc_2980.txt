Q :
Heavier objects also have more friction.
Can you explain why?
A :
Heavier objects press together with greater force, and this causes greater friction between them.
Did you ever try to furniture across the floor?
It’s harder to overcome friction between a heavier piece of furniture and the floor than between lighter pieces and the floor.
Friction Produces Heat
You know that friction produces heat.
That’s why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer.
But do you know why?
Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy.
This gives them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer.
Heat from friction can be useful.
It not only warms your hands.
It also lets you light a match as shown in the Figure below .
On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem.
It can cause the car to overheat.
Q :
How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine?
