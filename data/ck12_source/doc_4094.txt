Explain the relationship between evolution and natural selection.
How is this deer mouse well adapted for life in the forest?
Notice how its dark coloring would allow the deer mouse to easily hide from predators on the darkened forest floor.
On the other hand, deer mice that live in the nearby Sand Hills are a lighter, sand-like color.
What caused the deer mice to be so well adapted to their unique environments?
Natural selection.
The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited traits of a population change over time.
Inherited traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next.
For example, your eye color is an inherited trait.
You inherited your eye color from your parents.
Inherited traits are different from acquired traits , or traits that organisms develop over a lifetime, such as strong muscles from working out ( Figure below ).
Drawing of attached or free human earlobes, which is an inherited trait
Human earlobes may be attached or free.
You inherited the particular shape of your earlobes from your parents.
Inherited traits are influenced by genes, which are passed on to offspring and future generations.
Things not influenced by genes are not passed on to your offspring.
Natural selection only operates on traits like earlobe shape that have a genetic basis, not on traits that are acquired, like a summer tan.
Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce.
Natural selection means that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to offspring; individuals with those traits have a better chance of surviving.
Evolution occurs by natural selection.
