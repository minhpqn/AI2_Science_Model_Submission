Formation from Magma and Lava
You are on vacation at the beach.
You take your flip-flops off so you can go swimming.
The sand is so hot it hurts your feet.
You have to run to the water.
Now imagine if it were hot enough for the sand to melt.
Some places inside Earth are so hot that rock melts.
Melted rock inside the Earth is called magma.
Magma can be hotter than 1,000 o C.
When magma erupts onto Earth’s surface, it is known as lava ( Figure below ).
Minerals form when magma and lava cool.
Some minerals crystallize at hotter temperatures.
These minerals form first.
Other minerals form at cooler temperatures.
These minerals form later.
