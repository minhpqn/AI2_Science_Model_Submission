Instead, they get nutrients by eating other living things.
Therefore, animals are heterotrophs .
Like the cells of all eukaryotes, animal cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles (see Figure below ).
Unlike the cells of plants and fungi, animal cells lack a cell wall.
This gives animal cells flexibility.
It lets them take on different shapes so they can become specialized to do particular jobs.
The human nerve cell shown in Figure below is a good example.
Its shape suits its function of transmitting nerve impulses over long distances.
A nerve cell would be unable to take this shape if it were surrounded by a rigid cell wall.
Animal cell parts
Animal Cell.
The shape of an animal cell is not constrained by a rigid cell wall.
A bacterial cell is shown above for comparison.
Human Nerve Cell.
A human nerve cell is specialized to transmit nerve impulses.
How do you think the cellâ€™s shape helps it perform this function?
Animal Structure and Function
Animals not only have specialized cells.
Most animals also have tissues and organs.
In many animals, organs form organ systems, such as a nervous system.
