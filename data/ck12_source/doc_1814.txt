What's beneath your car tires?
Beneath an asphalt road is this incredible soil profile.
Can you identify the horizons?
There are some clues in the photo that can help you identify the climate type.
What type of climate would produce this soil?
Soil Horizons and Profiles
Soil develops over time and forms soil horizons.
Soil horizons are different layers of soil with depth.
The most weathering occurs in the top layer.
This layer is most exposed to weather!
It is where fresh water comes into contact with the soil.
Each layer lower is weathered just a little bit less than the layer above.
As water moves down through the layers, it is able to do less work to change the soil.
This is because the chemical reactions have already occurred.
If you dig a deep hole in the ground, you may see each of the different layers of soil.
All together, the layers are a soil profile .
Each horizon has its own set of characteristics ( Figure below ).
In the simplest soil profile, a soil has three horizons.
