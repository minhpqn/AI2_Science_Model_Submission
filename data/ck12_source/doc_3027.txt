The Figure below shows how momentum is conserved in the two colliding skaters.
The total momentum is the same after the collision as it was before.
However, after the collision, skater 1 has more momentum and skater 2 has less momentum than before.
Momentum is conserved in a collision
Q :
What if two skaters have a head-on collision?
Do you think momentum is conserved then?
A :
As in all actions and reactions, momentum is also conserved in a head-on collision.
You can see how at this URL:
Whenever an action and reaction occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the other.
However, total momentum is conserved.
This is the law of conservation of momentum.
Watch the astropitch animation at the following URL.
Experiment with different velocities.
Then take the quiz and check your answers.
State the law of conservation of momentum.
Fill in the missing velocity (x) in the diagram of a vehicle collision seen in the Figure below so that momentum is conserved.
