To transcribe means ‘‘to paraphrase or summarize in writing’’.
The information in DNA is transcribed - or summarized - into a smaller version - RNA - that can be used by the cell.
This process is called transcription.
The process in which cells make proteins is called protein synthesis .
It actually consists of two processes: transcription and translation .
Transcription takes place in the nucleus.
It uses DNA as a template to make an RNA molecule.
RNA then leaves the nucleus and goes to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where translation occurs.
Translation reads the genetic code in mRNA and makes a protein.
Transcription is the first part of the central dogma of molecular biology:
DNA → RNA .
It is the transfer of genetic instructions in DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA).
During transcription, a strand of mRNA is made that is complementary to a strand of DNA.
Figure below shows how this occurs.
You can watch an animation of the process at this link:
A detailed video about transcription is available at this link:

Overview of Transcription.
Transcription uses the sequence of bases in a strand of DNA to make a complementary strand of mRNA.
Triplets are groups of three successive nucleotide bases in DNA.
