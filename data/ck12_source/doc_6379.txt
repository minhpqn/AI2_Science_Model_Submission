Some acids are strong electrolytes because they ionize completely in water, yielding a great many ions.
Other acids are weak electrolytes that exist primarily in a non-ionized form when dissolved in water.
Acids have a sour taste.
Lemons, vinegar, and sour candies all contain acids.
Acids change the color of certain acid-base indicators.
Two common indicators are litmus and phenolphthalein.
Blue litmus turns red in the presence of an acid, while phenolphthalein turns colorless.
Acids react with active metals to yield hydrogen gas.
Recall that an activity series is a list of metals in descending order of reactivity.
Metals that are above hydrogen in the activity series will replace the hydrogen from an acid in a single-replacement reaction, as shown below:
Acids react with bases to produce a salt compound and water.
When equal moles of an acid and a base are combined, the acid is neutralized by the base.
The products of this reaction are an ionic compound, which is labeled as a salt, and water.
Properties of acids are described.
