Other chemical reactions release energy when they occur, so they can keep going without any added energy.
They are called exothermic reactions.
Q:
It makes sense that endothermic reactions need activation energy.
But do exothermic reactions also need activation energy?
A:
All chemical reactions need energy to get started, even exothermic reactions.
Look at the Figure below .
They compare energy changes that occur during endothermic and exothermic reactions.
From the graphs, you can see that both types of reactions need the same amount of activation energy in order to get started.
Only after it starts does the exothermic reaction produce more energy than it uses.
Activation energy of endothermic and exothermic reactions
A Common Example
You have probably used activation energy to start a chemical reaction.
For example, if you’ve ever struck a match to light it, then you provided the activation energy needed to start a combustion reaction.
When you struck the match on the box, the friction started the match head burning.
Combustion is exothermic.
Once a match starts to burn, it releases enough energy to activate the next reaction, and the next, and so on.
However, the match won’t burst into flames on its own.
All chemical reactions, including exothermic reactions, need activation energy to get started.
