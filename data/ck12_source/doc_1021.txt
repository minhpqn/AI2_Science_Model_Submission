So what is a hypothesis?
There are two hypotheses listed below.
They address a question about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Check out what those hypotheses are.
Then we'll see what to do with them next.
Asking a New Question
First, we need to find a question that we want to answer.
Let's start with the fact that atmospheric CO 2 has been increasing since 1958.
This leads us to ask the following: why is atmospheric CO 2 increasing?
Possible Answers to the Question
A hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for a small range of phenomena.
A hypothesis is limited in scope; it attempts to explain a single event or a fact.
A hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable .
In other words, we must be able to test it, and we must be able to disprove it.
Back to answering the question.
Let's say we do some background research to learn the possible sources of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
We discover that there are at least two (there are actually many more):
CO 2 is released into the atmosphere by volcanoes when they erupt.
CO 2 is released when fossil fuels are burned.
From these two facts, we can create two hypotheses; we will have multiple working hypotheses .
