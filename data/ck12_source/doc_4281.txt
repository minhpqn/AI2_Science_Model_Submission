Cnidarian body plans
Cnidarian Body Plans.
Cnidarians may exist in the polyp (left) or medusa (right) form.
The body of a cnidarian consists of two cell layers, ectoderm and endoderm.
The cells surround a digestive cavity called the coelenteron (see Figure below ).
Cnidarians have a simple digestive system.
The single opening is surrounded by tentacles, which are used to capture prey.
The tentacles are covered with nematocyst cells.
Digestion takes place in the coelenteron.
Nutrients are absorbed and gases exchanged through the cells lining this cavity.
Fluid in the coelenteron creates a hydrostatic skeleton.
Cnidarians have a simple nervous system consisting of a nerve net that can detect touch.
They may also have other sensory structures.
For example, jellyfish have light-sensing structures and gravity-sensing structures.
These senses give them a sense of up versus down.
It also helps them balance.
Figure below shows a general cnidarian life cycle.
Polyps usually reproduce asexually.
One type of asexual reproduction in polyps leads to the formation of new medusae.
Medusae usually reproduce sexually.
