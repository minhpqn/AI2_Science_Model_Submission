The lymph finally reaches the main lymph vessels in the chest.
Here, the lymph drains into two large veins.
This is how the lymph returns to the bloodstream.
Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, pathogens are removed from it at lymph nodes.
Lymph nodes are small, oval structures located along the lymph vessels.
They act like filters.
Any pathogens filtered out of the lymph at lymph nodes are destroyed by lymphocytes in the nodes.
Lymphocytes ( Figure below ), a type of white blood cell, are the key cells of an immune response.
There are trillions of lymphocytes in the human body.
They make up about one quarter of all white blood cells.
Usually, fewer than half of the body’s lymphocytes are in the blood.
The rest are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs.

This image of a lymphocyte was made with an electron microscope.
The lymphocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual size.
There are two main types of lymphocytes:
Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow.
They are named for the sites where they grow larger.
The "B" in B cells stands for “bone.” B cells grow larger in red bone marrow.
The "T" in T cells stands for “thymus.” T cells mature in the thymus gland.
