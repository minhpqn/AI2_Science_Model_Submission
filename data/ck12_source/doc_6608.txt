Eat right or take a supplement?

But too many people rely on the supplements to help their hearts and don’t understand the chemistry behind it all.
Yes, taking omega-3 fatty acids will give you some of the fatty acids your body requires.
No, this is not a substitute for eating a healthy diet and exercising.

A lipid is a member of a class of water-insoluble compounds that includes oils, fats, and waxes.
Oils and fats are based on the same general structure, but fats are solids at room temperature, while oils are liquids.
Butter is an example of a fat and is derived from animals.
Some oils include olive oil and canola oil, which are obtained from plants.
Lipids are an essential part of a healthy diet, though excess dietary fat can be harmful.
Lipids store energy in the body and are also needed to keep cell membranes healthy.
One type of lipid is called a triglyceride , an ester derived from glycerol combined with three fatty acid molecules.
