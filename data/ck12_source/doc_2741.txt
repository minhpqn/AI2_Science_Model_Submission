How many hydrogen atoms are there in the alkane that has five carbon atoms?
Draw the structural formula for this alkane.
If an alkane has eight carbon atoms, what state is it likely to be in at room temperature?
What is its chemical formula?
What is a saturated hydrocarbon?
How are saturated hydrocarbon compounds named?
What are the name and chemical formula of the saturated hydrocarbon that has the following structural formula seen below?
Compare and contrast straight-chain, branched-chain, and cyclic alkanes.
Describe isomers of hydrocarbons.
Contrast properties of isomers of the same hydrocarbon.
Relate the number of isomers to the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon.
Look at the desks in the photos above.
Both pictures show the same classroom with the same number of desks, but the desks are arranged differently in each picture.
The different arrangements work better for different classroom activities.
Desks in rows facing the front of the classroom are better for watching the teacher do demonstrations.
Desks facing each other in small groups are better for working on group projects.
What does the arrangement of desks in a classroom have to do with chemistry?
Like desks in a classroom, atoms in a hydrocarbon molecule can be arranged in different ways, and the different arrangements give them different properties.
Same Atoms, Different Shapes
Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms.
