Cynodonts were mammal-like therapsids.
They may have been ancestral to mammals.
They were about the size of a rat.
By the end of the Triassic Period, cynodonts had become even smaller in size.
They also had evolved many mammalian traits.
For example, they had
Four different types of teeth.
A relatively large brain.
Three tiny bones in the middle ear.
A diaphragm for breathing.
Cynodonts probably gave rise to mammals about 200 million years ago.
However, they are not considered to be mammals themselves.
In fact, competition with early mammals may have led to their extinction.
They went extinct sometime during the Jurassic or Cretaceous Period.
Amniotes called synapsids were the ancestors of mammals.
Synapsids named pelycosaurs had some of the traits of mammals by 275 million years ago.
Some synapsids evolved into therapsids, which became widespread during the Permian Period.
The few therapsids that survived the Triassic takeover were small, arboreal insect eaters.
They were also nocturnal.
Being active at night may explain why they survived and evolved still more mammalian traits.
