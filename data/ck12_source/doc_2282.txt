Scientists may now have an answer.
Recently, astronomers have discovered that the Universe is expanding even faster than before.
What is causing the expansion to accelerate?
One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the Universe that we canâ€™t see.
Astronomers call this dark energy .
We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter.
Some scientists think that dark energy makes up more than half of the Universe.

Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation.
For this reason it cannot be sensed by astronomers.
Dark matter does have gravity.
The effect of its gravity is seen on the motion of nearby objects.
Dark matter may be ordinary matter that is dark.
It may be different from ordinary matter.
It may be a combination of the two.
