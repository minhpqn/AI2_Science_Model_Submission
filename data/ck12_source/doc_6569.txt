Benzene is a fairly stable and unreactive molecule due to the electron delocalization around the six-membered ring.
The treatment of benzene with a halogen in the presence of an iron catalyst causes the substitution of a halogen atom for a hydrogen atom.
The resulting molecule is called an aryl halide.
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{\text{6}}(l)+\text{Br}_2(l) \xrightarrow{\text{FeBr}_3} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{Br}(l)+\text{HBr}(g)
Substitution of bromine onto benzene
Alkyl groups can be introduced onto a benzene ring by the reaction of benzene with an alkyl halide, using aluminum chloride as the catalyst.
In the reaction below, benzene reacts with chloroethane to produce ethylbenzene.
\text{C}_6\text{H}_6(l)+\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Cl}(g) \xrightarrow{\text{AlCl}_3} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3(l)+\text{HCl}(g)
Substitution of ethane onto benzene
The reaction of an alkyl halide with an inorganic hydroxide base at elevated temperature produces an alcohol.
The molecular reaction to produce methanol from iodomethane and sodium hydroxide is shown below.
\text{CH}_3\text{I}(l)+\text{NaOH}(aq) \xrightarrow{100^\circ \text{C}} \text{CH}_3\text{OH}(l)+\text{NaI}(aq)
