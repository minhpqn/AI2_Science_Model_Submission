Running.
A means of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot.
The knees, which connect one part of the leg to the other, have to allow the legs to move.
The knee is a joint, the part of the skeletal system that connects bones.
A joint is a place where two or more bones of the skeleton meet.
With the help of muscles, joints work like mechanical levers, allowing the body to move with relatively little force.
The surfaces of bones at joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage that reduces friction at the points of contact between the bones.
Types of Joints
There are three main types of joints: immovable, partly movable, and movable.
For a video about these types of joints, go to the link below.

Immovable joints allow no movement because the bones at these joints are held securely together by dense collagen .
The bones of the skull are connected by immovable joints.
Partly movable joints allow only very limited movement.
Bones at these joints are held in place by cartilage.
The ribs and sternum are connected by partly movable joints.
Movable joints allow the most movement.
Bones at these joints are connected by ligaments .
Movable joints are the most common type of joints in the body, so they are described in more detail next.
Movable joints are also known as synovial joints .
