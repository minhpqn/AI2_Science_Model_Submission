This is known as fitness.
Communication increases fitness by helping animals find food, defend themselves from predators, mate, and care for offspring.
Communication with Sound
Some animals communicate with sound.
Most birds communicate this way.
Birds use different calls to warn other birds of danger, or to tell them to flock together.
Many other animals also use sound to communicate.
For example, monkeys use warning cries to tell other monkeys in their troop that a predator is near.
Frogs croak to attract female frogs as mates.
Gibbons use calls to tell other gibbons to stay away from their area.
Communication with Sight
Another way some animals communicate is with sight.
By moving in certain ways or by “making faces,” they show other animals what they mean.
Most primates communicate in this way.
For example, a male chimpanzee may raise his arms and stare at another male chimpanzee.
This warns the other chimpanzee to keep his distance.
The chimpanzee pictured below may look like he is smiling, but he is really showing fear ( Figure below ).
He is communicating to other chimpanzees that he will not challenge them.
