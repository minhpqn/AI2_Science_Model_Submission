A unique DNA pattern that distinguishes between individuals of the same species using only samples of their DNA; also known as a genetic fingerprint.
genetic fingerprint :
A unique DNA pattern that distinguishes between individuals of the same species using only samples of their DNA; also known as a DNA fingerprint.
microsatellite :
Short sequences of 100-200 bp, usually due to repeats of 1-6 bp sequences; also known as a STR (Short Tandem Repeat) polymorphism.
restriction fragment length polymorphism :
Genetic differences due to differences between restriction enzyme sites; produces length variation of DNA segments upon analysis.
short tandem repeat (STR) :
Short sequences of 100-200 bp, usually due to repeats of 1-6 bp sequences; also known as a micro satellite.
Southern blot :
A method used to check for the presence of a specific DNA sequence in a DNA sample; named after its inventor Edwin Southern.
STR profile :
A genetic profile created through the analysis of 13 STR loci; often used in forensic analysis.
Genetic fingerprinting, or DNA fingerprinting, distinguishes between individuals of the same species using only samples of their DNA.
DNA fingerprinting has thus become one of the most powerful tools of the forensic scientist, enabling law enforcement personnel to match biological evidence from crime scenes to suspects.
