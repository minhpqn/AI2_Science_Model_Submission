Plant Cell Structures
Distinguish plant cells from animal cells.
Explain the roles of the chloroplast and central vacuole.
Summarize the function of the cell wall.
Do plants have cells like yours?
Yes, your cells are actually very similar to a plant's cells.
For example, they are both eukaryotic cells, both contain DNA in a nucleus, and both make proteins in ribosomes.
However, plant cells also differ in some crucial ways from your own cells.
Even though plants and animals are both eukaryotes, plant cells differ in some ways from animal cells ( Figure below ).
Plant cells have a large central vacuole, are surrounded by a cell wall, and have chloroplasts, which are the organelles of photosynthesis .
Photosynthesis converts the sun's solar energy into chemical energy.
This chemical energy, which is the carbohydrate glucose, serves as "food" for the plant.
Features of a plant cell
A plant cell has several features that make it different from an animal cell, including a cell wall, huge vacuoles, and chloroplasts, which photosynthesize.
First, plant cells have a large central vacuole that holds a mixture of water, nutrients, and wastes.
A plant cell's vacuole can make up 90% of the cellâ€™s volume.
The large central vacuole essentially stores water.
In animal cells, vacuoles are much smaller.
Second, plant cells have a cell wall , while animal cells do not ( Figure below ).
The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane but does not keep substances from entering or leaving the cell.
