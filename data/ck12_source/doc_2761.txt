Examples of lipids
(A) The white bands on these lamb chops are fat. (B) The yellow liquid in this bottle is olive oil.
Lipids consist only or mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Both fats and oils are made up of long chains of carbon atoms that are bonded together.
These chains are called fatty acids.
Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated.
In the Figure below you can see structural formulas for two small fatty acids, one saturated and one unsaturated.
Saturated fatty acids have only single bonds between carbon atoms.
As a result, the carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogens.
Saturated fatty acids are found in fats.
Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between carbon atoms.
As a result, some carbon atoms are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
They are unsaturated with hydrogens.
Unsaturated fatty acids are found in oils.
Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
Q:
Both of these fatty acid molecules have six carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms.
How many hydrogen atoms does each fatty acid molecule contain?
What else is different about the two molecules?
