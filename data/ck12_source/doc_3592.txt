During electron transport, energy is used to pump hydrogen ions across the mitochondrial inner membrane, from the matrix into the intermembrane space.
A chemiosmotic gradient causes hydrogen ions to flow back across the mitochondrial membrane into the matrix, through ATP synthase, producing ATP.
See Mitochondria at  for a detailed summary.

When you combine grapes and yeast, what have you begun to make?
Wine.
It may be slightly more complicated than that, but you need to start with grapes and yeast, and allow a natural fermentation process to occur.
Essentially, this is respiration without oxygen.

Today, most living things use oxygen to make ATP from glucose.
