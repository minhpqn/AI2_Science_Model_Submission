Both are added to soil when plant litter and dead organisms decompose.
Decomposition occurs too slowly in cold climates and too quickly in hot, wet climates for nutrients and organic matter to accumulate.
Temperate climates usually have the best soil for plant growth.
Climate and Biodiversity
Because climate determines plant growth, it also influences the number and variety of other organisms in a terrestrial biome.
Biodiversity generally increases from the poles to the equator.
It is also usually greater in more humid climates.
This is apparent from the desert and rainforest biomes pictured in Figure above .
Climate and Adaptations
Organisms evolve adaptations that help them survive in the climate of the biome where they live.
For example, in biomes with arid climates, plants may have special tissues for storing water (see Figure below ).
The desert animals pictured in Figure below also have adaptations for a dry climate.
Aloe and cactus have special tissues for storing waters
The aloe plant on the left stores water in its large, hollow leaves.
The cactus plant on the right stores water in its stout, barrel-shaped stems.
Gila monster and a kangaroo rat have adaptations to survive in the dry climate
The Gila monsterâ€™s fat tail is an adaptation to its dry climate.
It serves as a storage depot for water.
The kangaroo rat has very efficient kidneys.
They produce concentrated urine, thus reducing the amount of water lost from the body.
