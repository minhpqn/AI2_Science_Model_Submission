The dominant allele appeared 705 times out of a possible 929 times (705+224=929).
Probability = (705/929)
Probability is normally expressed in a range between 0 and 1, but it can also be expressed as a percentage, fraction, or ratio.
Expressed as a percentage, the probability that a plant of the F 2 generation will have purple flowers is 76%.
Expressed as a fraction it is about ¾,and as a ratio it is roughly 3:1.
The probability of the expression of the dominant allele for other characteristics can also be calculated the same way.
In fact, Mendel found that all the other dominant “factors” had approximately a ¾ probability of being expressed in the F 2 hybrid generation.
Review the Table below for the results for the other six characteristics.

The probability the recessive trait will appear in the F 2 hybrid generation is calculated in the same way.
Probability = (224/929)
The probability of the recessive trait appearing in the F 2 generation is 24% or about ¼.
Results predicted by probability are most accurate when many trials are done.
The best way to illustrate this idea is to toss a coin.
Because a coin has two sides, every time you toss it the chance of tossing heads or tossing tails is 50%.
The outcome of each separate toss is unaffected by any previous or future result.
For example, imagine you tossed seven heads in a row.
