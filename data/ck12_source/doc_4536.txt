Hypersecretion of growth hormone leads to abnormal growth, often called gigantism.
Destruction of hormone-secreting cells of a gland may result in not enough of a hormone being secreted.
This occurs in type 1 diabetes .
In this case, the bodyâ€™s own immune system attacks and destroys cells of the pancreas that secrete insulin, making type 1 diabetes an autoimmune disease.
A person with type 1 diabetes must frequently monitor the level of glucose in the blood (see Figure below ).
If the level of blood glucose is too high, insulin is injected to bring it under control.
If it is too low, a small amount of sugar is consumed.
Measuring blood glucose level
To measure the level of glucose in the blood, a drop of blood is placed on a test strip, which is read by a meter.
In some cases, an endocrine gland secretes a normal amount of hormone, but target cells do not respond to the hormone.
Often, this is because target cells have become resistant to the hormone.
Type 2 diabetes is an example of this type of endocrine disorder.
In type 2 diabetes, body cells do not respond to normal amounts of insulin.
As a result, cells do not take up glucose and the amount of glucose in the blood becomes too high.
This type of diabetes is usually treated with medication and diet.
The addition of extra insulin to the treatment can help some patients.
Endocrine system disorders usually involve the secretion of too much or not enough hormone.
For example, a tumor of the adrenal gland may lead to excessive secretion of growth hormone, which causes gigantism.
