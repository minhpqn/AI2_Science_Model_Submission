Is this evidence of evolution?
Take a close look at this gorilla hand.
The similarities to a human hand are remarkable.
Comparing anatomy, and characterizing the similarities and differences, provides evidence of evolution.
Evidence from Living Species
Just as Darwin did many years ago, todayâ€™s scientists study living species to learn about evolution.
They compare the anatomy, embryos, and DNA of modern organisms to understand how they evolved.
Comparative anatomy is the study of the similarities and differences in the structures of different species.
Similar body parts may be homologies or analogies.
Both provide evidence for evolution.
Homologous structures are structures that are similar in related organisms because they were inherited from a common ancestor.
