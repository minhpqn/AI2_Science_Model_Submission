Why?
Because predators could more easily spot the dark mice on light sand.
The lighter mice were more likely to survive and have offspring.
Natural selection favored the light mice.
Over time, the population became light colored.
Enough changes may take place over time that the two types of mice become different species.
This story is covered in more detail here:
Changes in the genes of a species may result in a new species.
This is biological evolution.
Natural selection can change a species or even make a new species.
Natural processes favor some traits over others in a population.
This causes those traits to be more common in subsequent generations.
Evolution just means change over time.
