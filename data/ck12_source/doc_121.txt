Other precocial birds include the domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese.
At the other extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of time.
For example, the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive parental care for six months, or until they are ready to fly, and then take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents ( Figure below ).
These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called altricial .
In most animals, male parental care is rare.
But it is very common in birds.
Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks.
Since birds often take great care of their young, some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism.
This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in another birdâ€™s nest.
The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite bird's eggs.

Great Frigatebird adults are known to care for their young for up to 20 months after hatching, the longest in a bird species.
Here, a young bird is begging for food.
Birds often use flashy displays to attract mates.
Breeding in birds is through internal fertilization, where the egg is fertilized inside the female.
Birds generally are monogamous, and both parents help to care for the young.
