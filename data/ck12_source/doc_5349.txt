The three unknown transfers are not believed to occur.
The 3 classes of information transfer suggested by the central dogma
DNA → DNA
RNA → DNA
protein → DNA
DNA → RNA
RNA → RNA
protein → RNA
RNA → protein
DNA → protein
protein → protein
Reverse transcription is the transfer of information from RNA to DNA.
The is the reverse of normal transcription.
Reverse transcription occurs in retroviruses, such as HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Retroviruses are RNA viruses that are duplicated in a host cell by using reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome.
Reverse transcription also occurs with retrotransposons and during telomere synthesis in eukaryotes.
Retrotransposons are self-replicating segments of eukaryotic genomes that use reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via a RNA intermediate.
A telomere is a region of repetitive noncoding nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromosome.
These sequences protect the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes.
Each time DNA is replicated, small segments of DNA from the ends of the chromosome is lost.
