The Hardy-Weinberg theorem states that, if a population meets certain conditions, it will be in equilibrium.
In an equilibrium population, allele and genotype frequencies do not change over time.
The conditions that must be met are no mutation, no migration, very large population size, random mating, and no natural selection.

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Model at
This resource states that evolution will not occur in a population if seven conditions are met.
What are these seven conditions?
If there is no evolution, what happened to gene frequencies?
What are p and q?
How is p determined?
p + q = _____
p 2 + 2pq + q 2 = _____
Describe a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population.
What conditions must it meet to remain in equilibrium?
Assume that a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a particular gene with two alleles, A and a .
The frequency of A is p , and the frequency of a is q .
Because these are the only two alleles for this gene, p + q = 1.0.
