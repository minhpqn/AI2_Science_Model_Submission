Ions such as sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca 2+ ), and chloride (Cl - ), are important for many cell functions.
Because they are polar, these ions do not diffuse through the membrane.
Instead they move through ion channel proteins where they are protected from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.
Ion channels allow the formation of a concentration gradient between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol.
Ion channels are very specific as they allow only certain ions through the cell membrane.
Some ion channels are always open, others are "gated" and can be opened or closed.
Gated ion channels can open or close in response to different types of stimuli such as electrical or chemical signals.
carrier protein :
A transport protein that is specific for an ion, molecule, or group of substances; carries the ion or molecule across the membrane by changing shape after the binding of the ion or molecule.
channel protein :
A transport protein that acts like a pore in the membrane that lets water molecules or small ions through quickly.
facilitated diffusion :
The diffusion of solutes through transport proteins in the plasma membrane.
gated channel protein :
A transport protein that opens a "gate," allowing a molecule to flow through the membrane.
ion channel :
A channel protein that transports ions across the membrane by facilitated diffusion.
passive transport :
