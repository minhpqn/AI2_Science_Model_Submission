Climate Change in Earth History
Explain how Earth's climate has changed in the past.
How important was the Pleistocene ice age to human evolution?
Climate is dynamic; climate has changed through Earth's history.
Climate has changed a lot during the time humans have been evolving.
As the climate got colder, people learned to hunt more since plants became scarce in the winter.
Better hunting required better tools.
Better tools helped to spur on the evolution of culture.

Earth’s climate has changed many times through Earth's history.

Picture in your mind dinosaurs roaming the land.
They're probably doing it in a pretty warm climate ( Figure below )!
