True predation is when a predator kills and eats its prey.
Some predators of this type, such as jaguars, kill large prey.
They tear it apart and chew it before eating it.
Others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, may eat their prey whole.
In some cases, the prey dies in the mouth or the digestive system of the predator.
Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of plankton at once.
The prey is digested afterward.
True predators may hunt actively for prey, or they may sit and wait for prey to get within striking distance.
Certain traits enable organisms to be effective hunters.
These include camouflage, speed, and heightened senses.
These traits also enable certain prey to avoid predators.
In grazing , the predator eats part of the prey but does not usually kill it.
You may have seen cows grazing on grass.
The grass they eat grows back, so there is no real effect on the population.
In the ocean, kelp (a type of seaweed) can regrow after being eaten by fish.
Predators play an important role in an ecosystem.
For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others.
Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control.
Predators can be keystone species .
These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem.
