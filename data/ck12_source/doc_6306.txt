The rate law must reflect the rate dependence on both reactants.
This reaction is said to be first order with respect to  A and first order with respect to B .
Overall, it is a second-order reaction.
The rate law and the order of a reaction must be determined experimentally.
A first-order reaction is described.
Read the material at the link below and answer the following questions:
What is a zero-order reaction?
What is a second-order reaction?
How is the order of a two-reactant reaction determined?
What is a first-order reaction?
How is the instantaneous rate determined?
How do we determine rate law and reaction order?
first-order reaction:
A reaction in which the rate is proportional to the concentration of only one reactant.
Determining the Rate Law from Experimental Data
Use experimental data to determine the rate law for a reaction.
Measuring time precisely is important in kinetic studies
Determining the amount of time a process requires calls for a timer.
These devices can be simple kitchen timers (not very precise) or complex systems that can measure to a fraction of a second.
Accurate time measurement is essential in kinetics studies for assessing rates of chemical reactions.
