In a testcross, an organism with an unknown genotype but dominant phenotype is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same trait.
Use these resources to answer the questions that follow.
Explain how a testcross is performed.
Gene express is dependent upon what factors?
Say you are given a male fly with a yellow body, how could you use a test cross to determine this fly's genotype?
What is a testcross?
What is the ratio when a EeBb is crossed with EeBb?
Identify the purpose of a testcross.
Give an example of in which a testcross would be utilized.
Provide the parental and offspring genotypes and phenotypes.
Assume tall (T) is dominant to dwarf (t).
If a homozygous dominant individual is crossed with a homozygous dwarf, the offspring will have what ratio?
In a cross between two hetozygotes (Aa), the next generation will have what ratio of homozygotes to heterozygotes?
Huntington's disease is due to an autosomal dominant allele.
If a heterozygous male marries a normal female, what percentage of the offspring will have Huntington's?
