However, the force put out by the machine, called the output force, is either greater than the input force or else applied over a greater distance.
Q :
Where is the force applied in a Ferris wheel and a doorknob?
Is it applied to the wheel or to the axle?
A :
In a Ferris wheel, the force is applied to the axle by the Ferris wheel’s motor.
In a doorknob, the force is applied to the wheel by a person’s hand.
Mechanical Advantage of a Wheel and Axle
The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which the machine changes the input force.
It equals the ratio of the output force to the input force.
A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force, depending on whether the input force is applied to the axle or the wheel.
When the input force is applied to the axle, as it is with a Ferris wheel, the wheel turns with less force.
Because the output force is less than the input force, the mechanical advantage is less than 1.
However, the wheel turns over a greater distance, so it turns faster than the axle.
The speed of the wheel is one reason that the Ferris wheel ride is so exciting.
When the input force is applied to the wheel, as it is with a doorknob, the axle turns over a shorter distance but with greater force, so the mechanical advantage is greater than 1.
This allows you to turn the doorknob with relatively little effort, while the axle of the doorknob applies enough force to slide the bar into or out of the doorframe.
At the following URL, you can see how much a wheel and axle increases the input force when it is applied to the wheel.
A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders, one inside the other, which both turn in the same direction around a single center point.
A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force, depending on whether the input force is applied to the axle or the wheel.
