The effective current through the lamp is 5.50 A.
What is the maximum current in the lamp?
direct current:
An electric current flowing in one direction only.
alternating current:
An electric current that reverses direction in a circuit at regular intervals.
electric generator:
An electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy.
armature:
The rotating part of a generator, consisting essentially of copper wire wound around an iron core.
State Lenzâ€™s law.
Explain back EMF and explain how it affects motors and generators.
Diagram of a handcrank powered lightbulb
This is a diagram of a hand-cranked demonstration generator.
Turning the hand crank spins a coil inside horseshoe magnets and generates an electric current that lights the bulb.
In order to generate an electric current in a conductor, the conductor must be part of a complete circuit.
If the light bulb is removed from this apparatus, the crank is very easy to turn.
If the light bulb is absent, the circuit is incomplete and no current is generated.
When the light bulb is place in the circuit, the circuit is complete and turning the crank will generate a current and light the bulb.
When the crank is turned with bulb in the circuit, it is more difficult to turn the crank.
