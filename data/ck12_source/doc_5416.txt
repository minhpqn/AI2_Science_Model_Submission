The BTC only provides a low level of transcription.
Other cis and trans factors must stimulate the BTC to increase transcription levels.
One such example of a BTC stimulating region of DNA is the CAAT box.
The Pribnow Box
The Pribnow box is the sequence of six nucleotides that is an essential part of a promoter site in bacteria.
The sequence 5'-TATAAT-3' is the most common, though slight variants of that sequence serve the same function.
It is located roughly 10 base pairs upstream from transcription initiation site.
The Pribnow box has a function similar to the TATA box that occurs in promoters in eukaryotes and archaea.
The regulation of transcription in prokaryotic is much simpler than in eukaryotes, and many fewer transcription factors, if any, are necessary.
In bacteria, this site is recognized and bound by a subunit of RNA polymerase during initiation of transcription.
The Pribnow box, like the TATA box, is the initial site where hydrogen bonds between the DNA strands are separated.
The AT-rich character of the two boxes allows this separation, as adenine and thymine are easier to separate then cytosine-guanine base pairs.
The CCAAT Box
The CCAAT Box , which is also known as the CAAT box or CAT box, is an eukaryotic cis-regulatory element with a 5'-GGCCAATCT-3' consensus sequence.
It occurs roughly 75-80 bases upstream of the initial transcription site.
This site is known to bind general transcription factors, including the CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs).
The C/EBPs recruit additional transcription factors to the initiation complex.
C/EBPs are characterized by a highly conserved basic- leucine zipper domain.
This domain is involved in dimerization and DNA binding like other transcription factors of the leucine zipper domain-containing family, including c-Fos and Jun.
Other DNA binding domains include the helix-turn-helix domain, the zinc finger domain and the helix-loop helix domain.
