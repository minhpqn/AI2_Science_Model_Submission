In a strong acid-weak base titration, the pH is less than 7 at the equivalence point.
Titration curve of a weak acid and strong base
Titration curve of weak acid and strong base.
Acid-base titration curves are described.
Read the material at the link below and answer the following questions:
Why is the equivalence point less than pH 7 for the titration of ammonia with HCl?
Why is it difficult to do a titration of a weak acid and a weak base?
Why do we get two inflection points for the titration of ethanedioic acid?
What does a titration curve tell us?
At what pH are the moles of acid and base equal?
Is the equivalence point for a weak acid-strong base titration the same as for a strong-acid-strong base titration?
titration curve:
A graphical representation of the pH of a solution during a titration.
Describe the use of indicators in acid-base experiments.
Cabbage can be used as a home-made indicator
Who would write a song about a cabbage?
There’s an old bluegrass song known as “Boil Them Cabbage Down” (check out a great performance at this link: ).
Many people enjoy the music, but chemistry students also enjoy the product of the boiled cabbage.
Extracting the anthocyanin dye from cabbage leaves with boiling water gives a solution that is red when acidic, purple when neutral, and green to yellow when basic (pictured above).
An acid-base indicator is a substance that displays different colors when in the presence of an acid or a base.
