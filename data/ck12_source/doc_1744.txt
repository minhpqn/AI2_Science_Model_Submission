They also have high rates of evaporation.
This makes them even drier.
The driest climates are deserts .
Most occur between about 15° and 30° latitude.
This is where dry air sinks to the surface in the global circulation cells.
Deserts receive less than 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain per year.
They may be covered with sand dunes or be home to sparse but hardy plants.
With few clouds, many deserts have hot days and cool nights.
Picture of deserts
Some deserts receive a small amount of rain during the winter and again during the summer.
This is enough to keep plants alive as in the left photo.
Some deserts receive very little rain or rain only one season a year.
These deserts have few plants as in the right photo.
Other dry climates get a little more precipitation.
They are called steppes .
These regions have short grasses and low bushes ( Figure below ).
Steppes occur at higher latitudes than deserts.
They are dry because they are in continental interiors or rain shadows.
