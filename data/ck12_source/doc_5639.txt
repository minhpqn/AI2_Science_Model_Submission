Did Dalton believe that atoms could be created or destroyed?
List the basic components of Dalton’s atomic theory.
What parts of the theory are not considered valid any more?
atom:
The smallest unit of an element.
atomic theory:  The general tenets of Dalton's atomic theory were as follows:
All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.
Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties.
Atoms of different elements differ in size, mass, and other properties.
Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed.
Atoms of different elements can combine in simple whole number ratios to form chemical compounds.
In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged
Cathode Ray Tube
Describe how the Crooke’s tube functioned.
Describe experiments that showed that cathode rays had mass.
Old cathode ray tube television
How old do you think this TV is?
The TV set seen above is becoming harder and harder to find these days.
The main reason is because they are older and based on outdated technology.  The new TV sets are flat screen technology that take up less space and give better picture quality, especially with the advent of high-definition broadcasting.  The technology used in the older TV sets used cathode ray tubes.  A beam of electrons was sprayed to a picture tube which was treated to react with the electrons to produce an image.  Similar CRT devices were used in computer monitors, now also replaced by flat screen monitors.
