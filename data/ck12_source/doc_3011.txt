Friction opposes the motion of all moving objects, so—like the skateboard—all moving objects eventually stop moving even if no other forces oppose their motion.
Later that day, Jonathan rode his skateboard and did some jumps.
You can see him in the picture below .
When he’s in the air, there is no rolling friction between his wheels and the ground, but another unbalanced force is acting on the skateboard and changing its motion.
Q :
What force is acting on the skateboard when it is in the air above the ground?
And how will this force change the skateboard’s motion?
A :
The force of gravity is acting on the skateboard.
It will pull the skateboard back down to the ground.
Once it’s on the ground, friction will slow its motion.

Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion.
Because of inertia, a resting object will remain at rest, and a moving object will keep moving.
Objects with greater mass have greater inertia.
To change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an unbalanced force acting on the object.
At the following URL, read about inertia and watch the truck-and-ladder animation.
Then answer the questions below.
Why does the ladder slide forward off the truck when the truck crashes into the car?
How could this be prevented?
