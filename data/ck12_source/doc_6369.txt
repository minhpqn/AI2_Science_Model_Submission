The resulting positive value of  \Delta G indicates that the reaction is not spontaneous at 25°C.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The unfavorable driving force of increasing enthalpy outweighed the favorable increase in entropy.
The reaction will be spontaneous only at some elevated temperature.
Available values for enthalpy and entropy changes are generally measured at the standard conditions of 25°C and 1 atm pressure.
The values are slightly temperature dependent and so we must use caution when calculating specific  \Delta G values at temperatures other than 25°C.
However, since the values for  \Delta H and  \Delta S do not change a great deal, the tabulated values can safely be used when making general predictions about the spontaneity of a reaction at various temperatures.
Calculations of free energy changes are described.
