The central dogma of molecular biology.
Coined by Francis Crick.
And in his own words, "I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect.
I had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful."
DNA → RNA → Protein
