Bison move near hot springs to escape the extreme cold.
Geysers are also created by water that is heated beneath the Earth’s surface.
The water may become superheated by magma.
It becomes trapped in a narrow passageway.
The heat and pressure build as more water is added.
When the pressure is too much, the superheated water bursts out onto the surface.
This is a geyser .
There are only a few areas in the world where the conditions are right for the formation of geysers.
Only about 1,000 geysers exist worldwide.
About half of them are in the United States.
The most famous geyser is Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park.
The geyser erupts every 60 to 70 minutes, shooting hot water nearly 60 meters in the air.
It is rare for a geyser to erupt so regularly, which is why Old Faithful is famous.
Castle Geyser ( Figure below ) is another geyser at Yellowstone Park; however, it does not erupt as frequently or predictably as Old Faithful.
Castle Geyser erupting in Yellowstone National Park
Castle Geyser is one of the many geysers at Yellowstone National Park.
Castle erupts regularly, but not as frequently or predictably as Old Faithful.
The Old Faithful web cam shows periodic eruptions of Yellowstone’s famous geyser in real time:
When magma heats groundwater, it may come to the surface as a hot spring or a geyser.
Geysers erupt because the water is trapped.
