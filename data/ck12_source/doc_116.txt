Adaptations for Flight
In comparing birds with other vertebrates, what do you think distinguishes them the most?
In most birds, flight is the obvious difference.
Birds have adapted their body plan for flight:
Their skeleton is especially lightweight, with large, air-filled spaces connecting to their respiratory system.
Their neck bones are flexible.
Birds that fly have a bony ridge along the breastbone that the flight muscles attach to ( Figure below ).
This allows them to remain stable in the air as they fly.
Birds also have wings that function as an aerofoil .
The surface of the aerofoil is curved to help the bird control and use the air currents to fly.
Aerofoils are also found on the wings of airplanes.

What other traits do you think might be important for flight?
Feathers help because they're more lightweight than scales or fur.
A birdâ€™s wing shape and size will determine how a species flies.
For example, many birds have powered flight at certain times, requiring the flapping of their wings, while at other times they soar, using up less energy ( Figure below ).
