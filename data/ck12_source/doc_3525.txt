Yes, but in this case, the ER is not just for emergencies.
True, there might be times when the cell responds to emergency conditions and the functions of the ER may be needed, but usually the cell's ER is involved in normal functions.
Proteins are also made on the outside of the ER, and this starts a whole process of protein transport, both around the inside of the cell and to the cell membrane and out.
In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells have many other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles, and centrioles.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (plural, reticuli) is a network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, flattened sheets, and round sacs.
These flattened, hollow folds and sacs are called cisternae.
The ER has two major functions:
Transport:
Molecules, such as proteins, can move from place to place inside the ER, much like on an intracellular highway.
Synthesis:
Ribosomes that are attached to ER, similar to unattached ribosomes, make proteins.
Lipids are also produced in the ER.
There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER).
Rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes, which gives it a "rough" appearance.
These ribosomes make proteins that are then transported from the ER in small sacs called transport vesicles.
The transport vesicles pinch off the ends of the ER.
The rough endoplasmic reticulum works with the Golgi apparatus to move new proteins to their proper destinations in the cell.
The membrane of the RER is continuous with the outer layer of the nuclear envelope.
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum does not have any ribosomes attached to it, and so it has a smooth appearance.
SER has many different functions, some of which include lipid synthesis, calcium ion storage, and drug detoxification.
