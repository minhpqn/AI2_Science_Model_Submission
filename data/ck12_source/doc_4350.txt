They were the first vertebrates to live on land, but they had to return to water to reproduce.
This meant they had to live near bodies of water.
The first reptiles evolved from an amphibian ancestor at least 300 million years ago.
They laid amniotic eggs and had internal fertilization.
They were the first vertebrates that no longer had to return to water to reproduce.
They could live just about anywhere.
Mammals and birds both evolved from reptile-like ancestors.
The first mammals appeared about 200 million years ago and the earliest birds about 150 million years ago.
Evolution of Endothermy
Until mammals and birds evolved, all vertebrates were ectothermic.
Ectothermy means regulating body temperature from the outside through behavioral changes.
For example, an ectotherm might stay under a rock in the shade in order to keep cool on a hot, sunny day.
Almost all living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic.
Their metabolic rate and level of activity depend mainly on the outside temperature.
They can raise or lower their own temperature only slightly through behavior alone.
Both mammals and birds evolved endothermy.
Endothermy means regulating body temperature from the inside through metabolic or other physical changes.
On a cold day, for example, an endotherm may produce more heat by raising its metabolic rate.
On a hot day, it may give off more heat by increasing blood flow to the surface of the body.
Keeping body temperature stable allows cells to function at peak efficiency at all times.
