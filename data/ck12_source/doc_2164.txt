Surprisingly, the photosphere is also one of the coolest layers of the Sun.
It is only about 6,000°C.
Layers of the Sun
The Sun's atmosphere contains the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona.
This image was taken by NASA's Spacelab 2 instruments.
The chromosphere ( Figure below ) lies above the photosphere.
It is about 2,000 km thick.
The thin chromosphere is heated by energy from the photosphere.
Temperatures range from about 4,000°C to about 10,000°C.
The chromosphere is not as hot as other parts of the Sun, and it glows red.
Jets of gas sometimes fly up through the chromosphere.
With speeds up to 72,000 km per hour, the jets can fly as high as 10,000 km.

The corona ( Figure below ) is the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere.
It is the Sun’s halo, or “crown.” With a temperature of 1 to 3 million K, the corona is much hotter than the photosphere.
The corona extends millions of kilometers into space.
Sometime you should try to see a total solar eclipse.
If you do, you will see the Sun’s corona shining out into space.

During a total solar eclipse, the Sun's corona becomes visible, peeking out from behind the Moon.
