While visiting a flower, a pollinator picks up pollen from the anthers.
When the pollinator visits the next flower, some of the pollen brushes off on the stigma.
This allows cross-pollination, which increases genetic diversity.
See The beauty of pollination at for an amazing look at this process.

Other Characteristics of Flowering Plants
Although flowers and their components are the major innovations of angiosperms, they are not the only ones.
Angiosperms also have more efficient vascular tissues.
Additionally, in many flowering plants the ovaries ripen into fruits.
Fruits are often brightly colored, so animals are likely to see and eat them and disperse their seeds (see Figure below ).

Brightly colored fruits attract animals that may disperse their seeds.
It’s hard to miss the bright red apples on these trees.
Evolution of Flowering Plants
Flowering plants are thought to have evolved at least 200 million years ago from gymnosperms like Gnetae.
The earliest known fossils of flowering plants are about 125 million years old.
The fossil flowers have male and female reproductive organs but no petals or sepals.
Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower.
This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower.
To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators.
