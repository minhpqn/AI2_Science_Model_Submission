A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy through the matter.
The matter through which a mechanical wave travels is called the medium ( plural , media).
There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves.
They differ in how particles of the medium move when the energy of the wave passes through.
