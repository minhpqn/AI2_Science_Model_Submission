Getting Food and Being Food (Or Not)
Organisms must be able to get food and avoid being food.
Hummingbirds have long, thin beaks that help them drink nectar from flowers.
Some flowers are tubular.
Different species of flowers have tubes of different lengths.
Different species of hummingbirds have different lengths of beaks.
A particular hummingbird species has evolved to feed from one or a few species of flowers.
The battle between needing food and being food plays out in the drama between lions and zebras.
When a herd of zebras senses a lion, the animals run away.
The zebrasâ€™ dark stripes confuse the lions.
It becomes hard for them to focus on just one zebra.
The zebras may get away.
But lions are swift and agile.
A lion may be able to get a zebra, maybe one that's old or sick.
There are 1.3 million known species, but many more have not been discovered.
The enormous number of species is due to the tremendous variety of environments in which they can live.
