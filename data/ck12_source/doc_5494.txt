Define and describe animal cloning.
Are cows cloned?
They are, but so are many other animals like sheep and goats.
Cloning allows large animals to produce drugs or proteins that are useful in medicine.

Animal Cloning
DNA technology has proved very beneficial to humans.
Transgenic animals are animals that have incorporated a gene from another species into their genome.
They are used as experimental models to perform phenotypic tests with genes whose function is unknown, or to generate animals that are susceptible to certain compounds or stresses for testing purposes.
Other applications include the production of human hormones, such as insulin.
Many times these animals are rodents, such as mice, or fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ).
Fruit flies are extremely useful as genetic models to study the effects of genetic changes on development.
GloFish are the first genetically modified animal to be sold as a pet and are transgenic zebrafish transfected with a natural fluorescence gene.
Watch these fish at or in the video below.

But transgenic animals just have one novel gene.
What about an animal with a whole new genome?
