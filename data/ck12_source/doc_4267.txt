This is needed for controlled movements in these directions.
Ancestors of flatworms also evolved mesoderm.
This is a third layer of cells between the ectoderm and the endoderm (see Figure below ).
Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of tissues, such as muscle.

Three Cell Layers in a Flatworm.
A flatworm has three cell layers.
Complete Digestive System
Early invertebrates had an incomplete digestive system.
There was just one opening for the mouth and anus.
Ancestors of modern roundworms were the first animals to evolve a complete digestive system .
With a separate mouth and anus, food could move through the body in just one direction.
This made digestion more efficient.
An animal could keep eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste.
Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions.
This led to the evolution of digestive organs.
Pseudocoelom and Coelom
Ancestors of roundworms also evolved a pseudocoelom.
This is a partial body cavity that is filled with fluid.
It allows room for internal organs to develop.
