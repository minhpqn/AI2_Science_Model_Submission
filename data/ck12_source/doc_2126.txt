Describe how ore deposits are mined.
Can you be a miner too?
Yes!
You can go to certain rivers or streams to mine for gold placers.
You dip a large metal pan into the stream, and get some gravel and a little water.
You swish the mix around.
The gold is the heaviest material and it will sink to the bottom of the pan.
You can then extract it.
The placers in the U.S with a lot of ore have already been mined out.
But you might make a little money!
If an ore is found to be profitable, it will probably be mined.
There are two major types of mining: surface mining and underground mining.
There are different types of each of those two.
Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earthâ€™s surface.
Overlying rock is blasted, and the rock that contains the valuable minerals is placed in a truck.
The truck takes the rock to a refinery.
As pictured below ( Figure below ), surface mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal.
As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined.
The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit.
Other methods of surface mining include strip mining, placer mining, and dredging.
