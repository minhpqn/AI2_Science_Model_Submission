genetic code :
The universal code of three-base codons; encodes the genetic instructions for the amino acid sequence of proteins.
protein synthesis :
The process in which cells make proteins; includes transcription of DNA and translation of mRNA.
retrotransposon :
A genetic element that can amplify itself in a genome.
reverse transcriptase :
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase; a DNA polymerase enzyme that transcribes single-stranded RNA into single-stranded DNA.
reverse transcription :
The process of transcribing single-stranded RNA into single-stranded DNA.
RNA replication :
The copying of one RNA to another; uses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
RNA silencing :
Gene silencing effect by which the expression of one or more genes is downregulated or entirely suppressed by the introduction of an antisense RNA molecule.
telomerase :
An enzyme which adds DNA sequence repeats to the 3' end of DNA strands in the telomere regions.
telomere :
A region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromosome; protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes.
“DNA makes RNA makes protein” is the central dogma of molecular biology.
Other transfers of genetic information include RNA replication and reverse transcription.
