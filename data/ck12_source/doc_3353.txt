Relate Earth’s inner structure to its magnetic field.
Did you ever see a globe like this one?
Magnets in the globe and its stand repel each other, allowing the globe to hover in midair.
The globe is a good model for Earth the magnet.
Earth the Magnet
Like the real Earth, the globe pictured above is a magnet.
A magnet is an object that has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field.
The magnetic globe is a modern device, but the idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new.
It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert.
He used a spherical magnet to represent Earth.
With a compass, he demonstrated that it the spherical magnet causes a compass needle to behave the same way that Earth causes a compass needle to behave.
This showed that a spherical magnet is a good model for Earth and therefore that Earth is a magnet.
Q:
Can you describe Earth’s magnetic poles and magnetic field?
A:
Earth has north and south magnetic poles.
The North Pole is located at about 80 degrees north latitude.
The magnetic field is an area around Earth that is affected by its magnetic field.
The field is strongest at the poles, and lines of magnetic force move from the north to the south magnetic pole.
