Three plates are pulling away from a central point.
The Breakup of Pangaea
At the end of the Paleozoic, there was one continent and one ocean.
Then Pangaea began to break apart about 180 million years ago.
The Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected oceans that we see today on Earth.
Continental rifting and then seafloor spreading pushed Africa and South America.
The Atlantic Ocean basin formed in between the continents.
Seafloor spreading continues to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean ( Figure above ).
Growth of Continents
The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents .
Mountain ranges grew near the continentsâ€™ edges.
The oceanic Farallon plate subducted beneath western North America during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous.
This activity produced igneous intrusions and other structures.
The intrusions have since been uplifted.
They are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains ( Figure below ).

The snow-covered Sierra Nevada is seen striking SE to NW across the eastern third of the image.
The mountain range is a line of uplifted batholiths from Mesozoic subduction.
Continents keep mantle heat from escaping.
This may eventually lead to continental rifting.
