Beta Decay (PhET Simulation)
Which of the following is true for the following reaction? \ ^{236}\;\mathrm{U} \rightarrow \ ^{90}\;\mathrm{Sr} + \ ^{143}\;\mathrm{Xe} + 3 ^{1}\;\mathrm{n}
This is a fission reaction.
This is a fusion reaction.
This is not a valid reaction, because the equations donâ€™t balance.
You detect a high number of alpha particles every second when standing a certain distance from a radioactive material.
If you triple your distance from the source, the number of alpha particles you detect will decrease.
By what factor will it decrease?
It will stay the same.
Write the nuclear equations A \to B + C for the following reactions.
The alpha decay of ^{219}\mathrm{Ra} .
The beta decay of ^{158}\mathrm{Eu} .
The beta decay of ^{53}\mathrm{Ti} .
The alpha decay of ^{211}\mathrm{Bi} .
Radium-226 undergoes alpha decay.
What element is produced?
Write the nuclear reaction for each of the processes described below:
Calcium-45 decays to produce Scandium (Sc)
undergoes alpha decay
helium-3 is produced by beta decay of a certain nuclide
