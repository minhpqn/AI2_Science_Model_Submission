Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.
In your own words, answer the following:
What is a chromosome?
What do chromosomes do?
Do all living things have the same types of chromosomes?
How are chromosomes inherited?
How were chromosomes discovered?
What does the term linkage refer to?
What is a linkage map?
What helps create a linkage map?
What did Thomas Hunt Morgan discover?
What did Alfred Sturtevant propose?
G and I have a recombination frequency of 8.5%.
G and H have a recombination frequency of 14%.
H and I have a recombination frequency of 22.5%.
Use these values to construct a rudimentary map for the chromosome that will tell you the order of the three genes relative to each other along the chromosome.
Will this information also tell you the genes absolute position on the chromosome?
