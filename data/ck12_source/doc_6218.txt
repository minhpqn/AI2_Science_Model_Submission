Where does electricity come from?
You probably have noticed these huge power lines delivering electricity across the country.
But how is this electricity generated?
Although there are some alternate sources like wind power and nuclear power, the majority of electricity in the United States is generated by burning coal.
Seedless plants were central in forming the coal deposits that we depend on.
Importance of Seedless Plants
Seedless plants have been tremendously useful to humans.
Without these plants evolving millions of years ago, life as we know it would be very different.
Seedless Plants Became Coal
The greatest influence seedless plants have had on human society is in the formation of coal millions of years ago.
When the seedless plants died, became buried deep in the Earth, and were exposed to heat and pressure, coal formed.
Coal is essentially made of the fossilized carbon from these plants.
