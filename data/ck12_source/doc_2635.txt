In the photo above, the rainbow of colors on the brush formed from just four paint colors: green, yellow, red, and blue.
The same thing is true of matter in general.
By combining just a few different elements, you can form many different chemical compounds.
What Are Compounds?
A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically.
Compounds form as a result of chemical reactions.
The elements in compounds are held together by chemical bonds.
A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions that share or transfer valence electrons.

Water is an example of a common chemical compound.
As you can see in the Figure below , each water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Water always has this 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen.
Like water, all compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements.
It doesnâ€™t matter how much or how little of a compound there is.
It always has the same composition.
All water molecules have two hydrogen atoms (gray) and one oxygen atom (blue).
Q:
Sometimes the same elements combine in different ratios.
How can this happen if a compound always consists of the same elements in the same ratio?
