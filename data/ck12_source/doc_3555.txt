Distinguish photosynthesis from chemosynthesis.
Name one major difference between a plant and an animal.
There are many differences, but in terms of energy, it all starts with sunlight.
Plants absorb the energy from the sun and turn it into food.
You can sit in the sun for hours and hours.
You will feel warm, but you're not going to absorb any energy.
You have to eat to obtain your energy.
Autotrophs vs.
Heterotrophs
Living organisms obtain chemical energy in one of two ways.
Autotrophs, shown in Figure below , store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they build themselves.
Food is chemical energy stored in organic molecules.
Food provides both the energy to do work and the carbon to build bodies.
Because most autotrophs transform sunlight to make food, we call the process they use photosynthesis .
Only three groups of organisms - plants, algae, and some bacteria - are capable of this life-giving energy transformation.
Autotrophs make food for their own use, but they make enough to support other life as well.
Almost all other organisms depend absolutely on these three groups for the food they produce.
The producers , as autotrophs are also known, begin food chains which feed all life.
Food chains will be discussed in the "Food Chains and Food Webs" concept.
Heterotrophs cannot make their own food, so they must eat or absorb it.
