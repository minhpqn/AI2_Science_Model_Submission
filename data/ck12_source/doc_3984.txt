Prokaryotic Cell.
The main parts of a prokaryotic cell are shown in this diagram.
The structure called a mesosome was once thought to be an organelle.
More evidence has convinced most scientists that it is not a true cell structure at all.
Instead, it seems to be an artifact of cell preparation.
This is a good example of how scientific knowledge is revised as more evidence becomes available.
Can you identify each of the labeled structures?
Cytoplasm and Cell Structures
Inside the plasma membrane of prokaryotic cells is the cytoplasm.
It contains several structures, including ribosomes, a cytoskeleton, and genetic material.
Ribosomes are sites where proteins are made.
The cytoskeleton helps the cell keep its shape.
The genetic material is usually a single loop of DNA.
There may also be small, circular pieces of DNA, called plasmids . (see Figure below ).
The cytoplasm may contain microcompartments as well.
These are tiny structures enclosed by proteins.
They contain enzymes and are involved in metabolic processes.
Location of prokaryotic DNA
Prokaryotic DNA.
The DNA of a prokaryotic cell is in the cytoplasm because the cell lacks a nucleus.
