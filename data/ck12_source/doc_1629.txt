The interior space that surrounds the thylakoids is filled with a fluid called stroma .
This is where carbon dioxide is used to produce glucose, the second part of photosynthesis.

The chloroplast is the photosynthesis factory of the plant.
What goes into the plant cell to start photosynthesis?
The reactants of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water.
These are the molecules necessary to begin the process.
But one more item is necessary, and that is sunlight.
All three components, carbon dioxide, water, and the sun's energy are necessary for photosynthesis to occur.
These three components must meet in the chloroplast of the leaf cell for photosynthesis to occur.
How do these three components get to the cells in the leaf?
Chlorophyll is the green pigment in leaves that captures energy from the sun.
Chlorophyll molecules are located in the thylakoid membranes inside chloroplasts.
The veins in a plant carry water from the roots to the leaves.
Carbon dioxide enters the leaf from the air through special openings called stomata ( Figure below ).

Stomata are special pores that allow gasses to enter and exit the leaf.
What is produced by the plant cell during photosynthesis?
The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen.
This means they are produced at the end of photosynthesis.
