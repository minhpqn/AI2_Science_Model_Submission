Shows the four nitrogen bases that make up the DNA of all species
Nitrogen Bases in DNA.
The DNA of all species has the same four nitrogen bases.
The Double Helix
After DNA was found to be the genetic material, scientists wanted to learn more about it.
James Watson and Francis Crick are usually given credit for discovering that DNA has a double helix shape, like a spiral staircase (see Figure below ).
The discovery was based on the prior work of Rosalind Franklin and other scientists, who had used X rays to learn more about DNA’s structure.
Franklin and these other scientists have not always been given credit for their contributions.
You can learn more about Franklin’s work by watching the video at this link:  (7:47).
Compares the shape of a DNA molecule with a spiral staircase
The DNA molecule has a double helix shape.
This is the same basic shape as a spiral staircase.
Do you see the resemblance?
Which parts of the DNA molecule are like the steps of the spiral staircase?
The double helix shape of DNA, together with Chargaff’s rules, led to a better understanding of DNA.
DNA, as a nucleic acid, is made from nucleotide monomers, and the DNA double helix consists of two polynucleotide chains.
Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing base (A, C, G, or T).
Scientists concluded that bonds (hydrogen bonds) between complementary bases hold together the two polynucleotide chains of DNA.
Adenine always bonds with its complementary base, thymine.
Cytosine always bonds with its complementary base, guanine.
