Your body also needs to remove the wastes that build up from cell activity and from digestion.
If these wastes are not removed, your cells can stop working, and you can get very sick.
The organs of your excretory system help to release wastes from the body.
The organs of the excretory system are also parts of other organ systems.
For example, your lungs are part of the respiratory system.
Your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your body, so they are also part of the excretory system.
More organs of the excretory system are listed below ( Table below ).
