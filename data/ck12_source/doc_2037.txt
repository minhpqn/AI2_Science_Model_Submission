The eras of the Phanerozoic Eon are separated by mass extinctions .
During these events, large numbers of organisms became extinct very rapidly.
There have been several extinctions in the Phanerozoic.
Two mass extinctions stand out more than the others.
One took place at the end of the Paleozoic.
The other took place at the end of the Mesozoic.
Between the Paleozoic Era and the Mesozoic Era was the largest mass extinction known.
At the end of the Permian, nearly 95% of all marine species died off.
In addition, 70% of land species became extinct.
No one knows the cause of this extinction.
Some scientists blame an asteroid impact.
Other scientists think it was a gigantic volcanic eruption.
It is possible that multiple things went wrong for life at the same time.
The environment was changing, an asteroid impacted, and a giant volcanic eruption took place.
In the Cambrian there was an explosion of life.
This explosion was in number and in diversity.
At the beginning of the Paleozoic, all life was in the seas.
Later in the Paleozoic, life colonized the land.
To colonize land, animals need to be able to keep themselves together.
They need to keep from drying out.
