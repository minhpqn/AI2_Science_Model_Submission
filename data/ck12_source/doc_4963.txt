The process of maintaining a stable environment inside a cell or an entire organism.
phagocytosis :
The process of engulfing and breaking down pathogens and other unwanted substances.
pinocytosis :
Type of vesicle transport that occurs when the plasma membrane folds inward to form a channel, allowing dissolved substances to enter the cell.
receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) :
Endocytosis in which the inward budding of plasma membrane vesicles containing proteins with receptor sites specific to the molecules being internalized; also known as clathrin-dependent endocytosis.
Endocytosis and exocytosis are active transport mechanisms in which large molecules enter and leave the cell inside vesicles.
In endocytosis, a substance or particle from outside the cell is engulfed by the cell membrane.
The membrane folds over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the membrane.
There are two main kinds of endocytosis: pinocytosis and phagocytosis.
What is the difference between endocytosis and exocytosis?
Why is pinocytosis a form of endocytosis?
Are vesicles involved in passive transport?

What does adrenaline do?
Adrenaline, or epinephrine, is a hormone and a neurotransmitter.
It increases heart rate, constricts blood vessels, dilates air passages, and participates in the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system.
Adrenaline is produced in the adrenal medulla of the adrenal gland.
