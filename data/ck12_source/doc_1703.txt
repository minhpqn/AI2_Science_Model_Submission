The Coriolis effect causes winds to strike the polar front at an angle.
Warm and cold fronts form next to each other.
Most winter storms in the middle latitudes, including most of the United States and Europe, are caused by mid-latitude cyclones ( Figure below ).

The arrows point the wind direction and its relative temperature;
L is the low pressure area.
Notice the warm, cold, and occluded fronts.
The warm air at the cold front rises and creates a low pressure cell.
Winds rush into the low pressure.
This creates a rising column of air.
The air twists, rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
Since the rising air is moist, rain or snow falls.
Mid-latitude cyclones form in winter in the mid-latitudes.
The storms move eastward with the westerly winds.
These two- to five-day storms can reach 1,000 to 2,500 km (625 to 1,600 miles) in diameter.
They can produce winds up to 125 km (75 miles) per hour.
Mid-latitude cyclones are especially fierce in the mid-Atlantic and New England states.
They are called nor’easters because they come from the northeast.
About 30 nor’easters strike the region each year ( Figure below ).
