Grapefruit juice is quite acidic
Why is grapefruit juice acidic?
Grapefruit juice has a pH of somewhere between 2.9-3.3, depending on the specific product.
Excessive exposure to this juice can cause erosion of tooth enamel and can lead to tooth damage.
The acids in grapefruit juice are carbon-based, with citric acid being one of the major constituents.
This compound has three ionizable hydrogens on each molecule which contribute to the relatively low pH of the juice.
Another component of grape juice is malic acid, containing two ionizable hydrogens per molecule.
The pH Scale
Expressing the acidity of a solution by using the molarity of the hydrogen ion is cumbersome because the quantities are generally very small.
Danish scientist Søren Sørenson (1868-1939) proposed an easier system for indicating the concentration of H + called the pH scale.
The letters pH stand for the power of the hydrogen ion.
