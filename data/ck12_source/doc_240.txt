How far from the base of the building will the ball land?
An arrow is fired downward at an angle of 45 degrees from the top of a 200 m cliff with a velocity of 60.0 m/s.
How long will it take the arrow to hit the ground?
How far from the base of the cliff will the arrow land?
trajectory:
The ballistic trajectory of a projectile is the path that a thrown or launched projectile will take under the action of gravity, neglecting all other forces, such as air resistance, without propulsion.
Define centripetal acceleration.
Understand the theory of the centripetal acceleration equation.
Use the centripetal acceleration equation.
Understand the angular relationship between velocity and centripetal acceleration.
Use the equations for motion in two directions and Newton's Laws to analyze circular motion.
Weather satellite orbiting Earth is an example of circular motion
Weather satellites, like the one shown above, are found miles above the earth's surface.
Satellites can be polar orbiting, meaning they cover the entire Earth asynchronously, or geostationary, in which they hover over the same spot on the equator.
The earth is a sphere.
If you draw a horizontal straight line from a point on the surface of the earth, the surface of the earth drops away from the line.
The distance that the earth drops away from the horizontal line is very small â€“ so small, in fact, that we cannot represent it well in a drawing.
In the sketch below, if the blue line is 1600 m, the amount of drop (the red line) would be 0.20 m.
If the sketch were drawn to scale, the red line would be too short to see.
Drawing a horizontal line from the surface of the Earth shows a very small vertical drop
