Mammalian Teeth (Human)
Mammalian Teeth (Human).
With their different types of teeth, mammals can eat a wide range of foods.
Lungs and Heart of Mammals
Keeping the rate of metabolism high takes a constant and plentiful supply of oxygen.
That’s because cellular respiration , which produces energy, requires oxygen.
The lungs and heart of mammals are adapted to meet their oxygen needs.
The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli .
These are tiny, sac-like structures.
Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ).
Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream.
Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli.
They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).
That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!
Alveoli of Mammalian Lungs
Alveoli of Mammalian Lungs.
Clusters of alveoli resemble tiny bunches of grapes.
They are surrounded by many blood vessels for gas exchange.
Mammals breathe with the help of a diaphragm .
This is the large muscle that extends across the bottom of the chest below the lungs.
