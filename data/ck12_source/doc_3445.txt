The idea of evolution has been around for centuries.
In fact, it goes all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.
However, evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin.
Darwin published a book on evolution in 1859 titled On the Origin of Species .
In the book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection.
He also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs.
Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time.
As described by Darwin, evolution occurs by a process called natural selection .
In natural selection, some members of a species, being better adapted or suited to their environment, produce more offspring than others, so they pass "advantageous traits" to their offspring.
Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of the species.
Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth.
As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment.
This is because they evolve adaptations.
An adaptation is a trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in a given environment.
Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not well-received at first.
Many people found it hard to accept the idea that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs.
Look at the cartoon in Figure below .
Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape.
The cartoon reflects how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time.
Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason.
