Suggest a reason for this.
A device like a laser, that emits microwave radiation is called a maser .
What words are likely to make up this acronym?
What do you call an atom whose electrons have reached a higher energy state?
When an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, what is emitted by the atom?
laser:
A device that emits highly amplified and coherent radiation of one or more discrete frequencies
stimulated emission:
The emission of electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons of a given frequency, triggered by photons of the same frequency.
coherent light:
