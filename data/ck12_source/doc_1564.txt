The next belt is the westerlies.

Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere.
They are also the result of unequal heating of the atmosphere.
Jet streams circle the planet, mainly from west to east.
The strongest jet streams are the polar jets.
PIctured below is the northern polar jet ( Figure below ).

This jet stream helps planes fly quickly from west to east over North America.
How do you think it affects planes that fly from east to west?
