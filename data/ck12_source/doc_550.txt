In addition to pathogens, phagocytes “eat” dead cells.
They surround the pathogens and destroy them.
Sometimes it is said that the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then destroys it.
This process is called phagocytosis .
White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever.
A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature.
Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C).
Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature.
When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them.
A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells.
In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.
If pathogens enter your body, inflammation occurs.
White blood cells called phagocytes travel to areas of the body that are inflamed.
