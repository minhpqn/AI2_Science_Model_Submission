P_2=\frac{387 \text{ kPa} \times 425 \text{ mL}}{1750 \text{ mL}}=94.0 \text{ kPa}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The volume has increased to slightly over 4 times its original value and so the pressure is decreased by about \frac{1}{4}{th} .
The pressure is in kPa and the value has three significant figures.
Note that any pressure or volume units can be used as long as they are consistent throughout the problem.

The volume of a gas is inversely proportional to temperature.
Do the problems at the link below:
What does “inversely” mean in this law?
Explain Boyle’s law in terms of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases.
Does it matter what units are used?
Boyle’s law:
The volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant.
