Molecules, such as proteins, can move from place to place inside the ER, much like on an intracellular highway.
Synthesis :
Ribosomes that are attached to ER, similar to unattached ribosomes, make proteins.
Lipids are also produced in the ER.
There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER).
Rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes which gives it a "rough" sandpaper-like appearance.
The ribosomes on the RER make proteins that are then transported from the ER in small phospholipid sacs called transport vesicles .
The transport vesicles pinch off the ends of the ER.
These vesicles can easily shuttle proteins between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.
The RER works with the Golgi apparatus to move new proteins to their proper destinations in the cell or to the cell membrane.
Proteins that are made on the RER are inserted directly into the ER and then are transported to their various cellular destinations, including the cell membrane.
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum does not have any ribosomes attached to it, and so it has a smooth appearance.
SER has many different functions some of which are: lipid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, calcium ion storage, steroid metabolism and drug detoxification.
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in both animal and plant cells and it serves different functions in each.
The SER is made up of tubules and vesicles that branch out to form a network.
In some cells there are dilated areas like the sacs of RER.
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum and RER form an interconnected network of membranous cisternae, tubules and vesicles.
Image of nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and how they work together.
The process of secretion from endoplasmic reticuli (orange) to Golgi apparatus (pink) is shown.
The ER plays a significant role in protein transport.
