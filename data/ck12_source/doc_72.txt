The lone fish has a skeleton of bone.
The rays have a skeleton of cartilage, and so they are known as cartilaginous fish.
The 1,000 or so species of cartilaginous fish are subdivided into two subclasses: the first includes sharks, rays, and skates; the second includes chimaera, sometimes called ghost sharks.
Fish from this group range in size from the dwarf lanternshark, at 6.3 inches, to the over 50-foot whale shark.
Sharks obviously have jaws, as do the other cartilaginous fish.
These fish evolved from the jawless fish.
So why did fish eventually evolve to have jaws?
Such an adaptation would allow fish to eat a much wider variety of food, including plants and other organisms.
Other characteristics of cartilaginous fish include:
Skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone.
Cartilage is supportive tissue that does not have as much calcium as bones, which makes bones rigid.
Cartilage is softer and more flexible than bone.
Blood, Skin, and Teeth
Since they do not have bone marrow (as they have no bones), red blood cells are produced in the spleen, in special tissue around the reproductive organs, and in an organ called Leydigâ€™s organ , only found in cartilaginous fishes.
The tough skin of this group of fish is covered with placoid scales , which are hard scales formed from modified teeth.
The scales are covered with a hard enamel.
The hard covering and the way the scales are arranged, gives the fish skin rough, sandpaper-like feel.
The function of these scales is for protection against predators.
The shape of sharks' teeth differ according to their diet.
Species that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense flattened teeth for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey, such as mammals, have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting.
