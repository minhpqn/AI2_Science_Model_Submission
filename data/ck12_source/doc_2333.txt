Q:
What trade-offs might there be on the design of a kite?
A:
You might want to make a big kite, but if itâ€™s too big it might be too heavy.
Then it would fly only on very windy days.
Or you might want to make a kite using a certain material that you really like, but the material might cost more than you can afford to spend.
All technological designs have constraints, or limits, on the design.
Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and properties of materials.
Social design constraints include factors such as ease of use, safety, attractiveness, and cost.
All technological designs have trade-offs because no design is perfect.
Choosing the best design involves weighing the pros and cons of different options.
