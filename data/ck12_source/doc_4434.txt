The earliest mammals evolved from cynodonts .
But the evolution of mammals didnâ€™t end there.
Mammals continued to evolve.
Monotreme mammals probably split off from other mammals first.
They were followed by marsupials.
Placental mammals probably evolved last.
Evolution of Monotremes
The first monotremes may have evolved about 150 million years ago.
Early monotreme fossils have been found in Australia.
An example is a genus called Steropodon , shown in Figure below .
It may have been the ancestor of the platypus.
Early monotremes retained some of the traits of their therapsid ancestors.
For example, they laid eggs and had a cloaca.
These traits are still found in modern monotremes.

Probable Monotreme Ancestor:
Steropodon .
Like the platypus, Steropodon probably had a bill.
Evolution of Marsupials
The first marsupials may have evolved about 130 million years ago.
