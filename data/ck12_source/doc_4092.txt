And the evolution of life, as Darwin was developing his ideas, would definitely take much longer than just 6,000 years.
During the Voyage of the Beagle , Darwin observed fossils of sea life high up in the mountains.
What must happen to the Earth for this to occur?  Darwin, using the readings of Lyell, took this as evidence of a constantly changing Earth.
After the Voyage of the Beagle , another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace ( Figure below ), developed a similar theory of evolution by natural selection.
Wallace toured South America and made similar observations to Darwin's.
Darwin and Wallace presented their theories and evidence in public together.
Due to the large number of observations and conclusions he made, Darwin is mostly credited and associated with this theory.

Alfred Wallace developed a similar theory of evolution by natural selection.
Imagine developing a theory that conflicted with widely held beliefs of the time, as Darwin did.
Imagine pulling together material from all these different people, adding his own findings, and turning it all into his theory.
Imagine the torment Darwin must have endured during this time, knowing the skepticism that would follow the release of his findings.
But, upon his death, Darwin was given one of the highest honors in England.
Darwin is buried in Westminster Abbey, the final resting place of many of England's kings and queens.
Why was he buried in such an important spot?
Darwinâ€™s ideas conflicted with widely held beliefs, such as the idea that organisms never change and that the world was only about 6,000 years old.
Darwin was influenced by other scientists, including Lamarck, Lyell, and Wallace.
