Paleozoic era Devonian period forest, with club mosses, horsetails, and ferns
On land, club mosses, horsetails, and ferns joined primitive seed plants and early trees to form the first forests.
The Carboniferous Period :
Next, during the Carboniferous Period (360–290 million years ago), widespread forests of huge plants left massive deposits of carbon that eventually turned to coal.
The first amphibians evolved to move out of the water and colonize land, but they had to return to the water to reproduce.
Soon after amphibians arose, the first reptiles evolved.
They were the first animals that could reproduce on dry land.
The Permian Period :
During the Permian Period (290–245 million years ago), all the major land masses collided to form a supercontinent called Pangaea .
Temperatures were extreme, and the climate was dry.
Plants and animals evolved adaptations to dryness, such as waxy leaves or leathery skin to prevent water loss.
The Permian Period ended with a mass extinction.
The supercontinent Pangaea
The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of today’s continents in a single land mass.
This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species, and may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permian - the most massive extinction ever recorded.
In the mass extinction that ended the Permian, the majority of species went extinct.
Many hypotheses have been offered to explain why this mass extinction occurred.
These include huge meteorites striking Earth and enormous volcanoes spewing ashes and gases into the atmosphere.
Both could have darkened the skies with dust for many months.
This, in turn, would have shut down photosynthesis and cooled the planet.
