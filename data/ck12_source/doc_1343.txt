Liquefaction of sediments in Mexico City caused the collapse of many buildings in the 1985 earthquake.
Earthquake effects on buildings are seen in this animation:
In earthquake-prone areas, city planners try to reduce hazards.
They look at both the likelihood of a quake and the damage one would do.
For example, in the San Francisco Bay Area, maps show how much shaking is expected for different ground types ( Figure below ).
This allows planners to locate new hospitals and schools more safely.

Seismic waves rarely kill anyone.
Structures falling on people and fires or tsunamis after the earthquake cause many more fatalities.
City planning can lessen the damage done by earthquakes.
Population density and ground type affect the number of fatalities.
