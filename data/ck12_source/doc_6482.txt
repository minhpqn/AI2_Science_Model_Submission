& \text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \ (\text{anode} - \text{oxidation})\\& 2\text{H}^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2 \ (\text{cathode} - \text{reduction})
and the measured cell voltage is 0.76 volts (abbreviated as v).
We define the standard emf (electromotive force) of the cell as:
E^0{_{\text{cell}}} &= E^0{_{\text{cathode}}} - E^0{_{\text{anode}}} \\0.76 \text{ V} &= 0 - E^0_{\text{Zn cell}} \\E^0_{\text{Zn cell}} &= - 0.76 \ \text{volts}
We can do the same determination with a copper cell ( Figure below ).
Standard hydrogen half-cell with copper half-cell
The standard hydrogen half-cell paired with a copper half-cell.
As we run the reaction, we see that the mass of the copper increases, so we write the half-reaction:
\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2 e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}
This makes the copper electrode the cathode.
We now have the two half-reactions:
& \text{H}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}^+ + 2 e^- \ \text{(anode)}\\& \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2 e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} \ \text{(cathode)}
and we determine the E^0  for the system to be 0.34 v.
Again, E^0{_{\text{cell}}} = E^0{_{\text{cathode}}} - E^0{_{\text{anode}}}
0.34 \text{ V} = E^o_{\text{copper}} - 0 \ \text{so copper potential} = 0.34 \text{ V}
Now we want to build a system in which both zinc and copper are involved.
We know from the activity series that zinc will be oxidized and cooper reduced, so we can use the values at hand:
E^0{_{\text{cell}}} = 0.34 \text{ V (copper)} - (-0.76 \text{ V zinc}) = 1.10 \ \text{volts for the cell}
The structure of the standard hydrogen electrode is described.
Examples of using this electrode to determine reduction potentials are given.
