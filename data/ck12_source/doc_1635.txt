Process of Cellular Respiration
Describe the structure of a mitochondrion.
List the three steps of cellular respiration.
Write the chemical reaction of cellular respiration.
Explain the process of cellular respiration.
Why do you need to breathe?
Of course if you didn't breathe, you couldn't survive.
Why do you need air to live?
You need the gas oxygen to perform cellular respiration to get energy from your food.
The Process of Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration is the process of extracting energy in the form of ATP from the glucose in the food you eat.
How does cellular respiration happen inside of the cell?
Cellular respiration is a three step process.
Briefly:
In stage one, glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm of the cell in a process called glycolysis .
In stage two, the pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondria.
The mitochondria are the organelles known as the energy "powerhouses" of the cells ( Figure below ).
In the mitochondria, the pyruvate, which have been converted into a 2-carbon molecule, enter the Krebs cycle.
Notice that mitochondria have an inner membrane with many folds, called cristae .
These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area where many of the cellular respiration reactions take place.
