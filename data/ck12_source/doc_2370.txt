Assume that an object has been placed in the pan of a triple beam balance.
The scales of the balance are shown below.
What is the mass of the object?
How much liquid does this graduated cylinder contain?

Have you ever played golf, like the boy in this photo?
Even if you havenâ€™t played golf before, you probably know that the goal of the game is to hit the ball into a hole with the fewest strokes of the club.
Golf is a good way to understand two important concepts in scientific measurement: accuracy and precision.
The accuracy of a measurement is how close the measurement is to the true value.
If you were to hit four different golf balls toward an over-sized hole, all of them might land in the hole.
These shots would all be accurate because they all landed in the hole.
This is illustrated in the sketch below.
As you can see from the sketch above, the four golf balls did not land as close to one another as they could have.
Each one landed in a different part of the hole.
Therefore, these shots are not very precise.
The precision of measurements is how close they are to each other.
If you make the same measurement twice, the answers are precise if they are the same or at least very close to one another.
The golf balls in the sketch below landed quite close together in a cluster, so they would be considered precise.
