Scientists searched for the missing element, and they found it just a few years later.
They named the new element gallium.
Scientists searched for the other missing elements in Mendeleev’s table and eventually found all of them.
An important measure of a good model is its ability to make accurate predictions.
This makes it a useful model.
Clearly, Mendeleev’s periodic table was a useful model.
It helped scientists discover new elements and made sense of those that were already known.
In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev developed a method for organizing elements based on their atomic mass.
His method was later revised, but it served as a basis for the method used today.
Mendeleev created a periodic table of all the elements that were known at the time.
The rows of the table, called periods, each contained eight elements that increased in atomic mass from left to right.
The columns of the table, called groups, contained elements with similar properties.
Mendeleev’s periodic table was a good model because it could be used to predict unknown elements and their properties.
All of these missing elements were eventually discovered.
