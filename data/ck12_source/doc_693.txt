virtual image:
An image that cannot be projected onto a screen.
You can only see the image by looking into the mirror or lens forming the image.
The light that forms a virtual image does NOT pass through the image position.
Images in a Concave Mirror
Define the focal point and focal length.
Explain the rules of ray tracing in concave mirrors.
Define spherical aberration.
Predict real or virtual images based object position for concave mirror.
Locate concave mirror images with ray diagrams.
Calculate image position and magnification using the mirror equation.
Concave mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope
Concave mirrors are used in a number of applications.
They form upright, enlarged images, and are therefore useful in makeup application or shaving.
They are also used in flashlights and headlights because they project parallel beams of light, and in telescopes because they focus light to produce greatly enlarged images.
The photograph above shows the grinding of the primary mirror in the Hubble space telescope.
The Hubble Space Telescope is a reflecting telescope with a mirror approximately eight feet in diameter, and was deployed from the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990.
Image in a Concave Mirror
Reflecting surfaces do not have to be flat.
The most common curved mirrors are spherical.
