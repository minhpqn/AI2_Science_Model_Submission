They only exist in the frame of reference of the object that is moving and, even then, are theoretical.
Physicists dealing in a moving frame of reference use centrifugal forces to ease calculations.
For a great explanation of the difference between centrifugal and centripetal force, see this video:
Centripetal force is the force that causes centripetal acceleration.
Equations for centripetal force are  F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r} and F_c=\frac{4 \pi^2 rm}{T^2} .
A video of physics students riding a roller coaster.
Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.
Does the roller coaster in the video have a complete circle as part of its path?
What is it that keeps the glass of water on the tray as it swings over the student's head?
What causes the centripetal force acting on the water in the cup?
The roller coaster?
A runner moving at a speed of 8.8 m/s rounds a bend with a radius of 25 m.  What is the centripetal force needed to keep this runner on the curve and what supplies this force?
A 1000. kg car rounds a curve of 50.0 m radius on a flat road with a speed of 14.0 m/s.
Will the car make the turn successfully if the pavement is dry and the coefficient of friction is 0.60?
Will the car make the turn successfully if the pavement is wet and the coefficient of friction is 0.20?
An 0.500 kg object tied to a string is swung around a person's head in a horizontal circle.  The length of the string is 1.00 m and the maximum force the string can withstand without breaking is 25.0 N.  What is the maximum speed the object may be swung without breaking the string?
centripetal force:
The component of force acting on a body in curvilinear motion that is directed toward the center of curvature or axis of rotation.
