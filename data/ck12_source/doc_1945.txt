This split the Farallon Plate into two smaller plates.
The plates started a transform motion where the Pacific and North American plates meet.
This formed the San Andreas Fault.
The fault moved inland.
Evolution of the San Andreas Fault
This figure shows the evolution of the San Andreas Fault zone from 30 million years ago (bottom) to present (top).
Most Cenozoic plate tectonic activity involves continents moving apart.
But smaller regions are coming together.
Africa collided with Eurasia to create the Alps.
India crashed into Asia to form the Himalayas.
The Pleistocene ice ages began 2.6 million years ago.
Glaciers advanced and retreated four times ( Figure below ).
During the retreats, the climate was often warmer than it is today.
Glacial ice at its maximum during the Pleistocene
Glacial ice at its maximum during the Pleistocene.
These continental ice sheets were extremely thick, like the Antarctic ice cap is today.
The Pleistocene ice ages guided the evolution of life in the Cenozoic, including the evolution of humans.
During the Cenozoic, Pangaea began to split up.
Subduction of the Farallon plate has resulted in the formation of the Rocky Mountains and the San Andreas Fault.
The Pleistocene was marked by four advances of ice.
