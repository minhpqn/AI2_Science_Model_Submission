A certain area of the brain receives and interprets information from each sense organ.
For example, information from the nose is received and interpreted by the temporal lobe of the cerebrum.
These raspberries stimulate several senses in the body
Which senses would be stimulated by these raspberries?
The Motor Division
The motor division of the peripheral system carries messages from the central nervous system to internal organs and muscles.
The motor division is also divided into two parts ( Figure above ), the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.
The somatic nervous system carries messages that control body movements.
It is responsible for activities that are under your control, such as waving your hand or kicking a ball.
The girl pictured below ( Figure below ) is using her somatic nervous system to control the muscles needed to play the violin.
Her brain sends messages to motor neurons that move her hands so she can play.
Without the messages from her brain, she would not be able to move her hands and play the violin.
The somatic nervous system controls the movements of hands and arms
These women's central nervous systems are controlling the movements of their hands and arms as they play the violin.
Their brains send commands to their somatic nervous system, which controls the muscles of their hands and arms.
The autonomic nervous system carries nerve impulses to internal organs.
It controls activities that are not under your control, such as sweating and digesting food.
The autonomic nervous system has two parts:
The sympathetic division controls internal organs and glands during emergencies.
It prepares the body for fight or flight ( Figure below ).
