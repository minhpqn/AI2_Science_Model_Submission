Scalars are quantities, such as mass, length, or speed, that are completely specified by magnitude and have no direction.
Vectors are quantities possessing both magnitude and direction and can be represented by an arrow; the direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the quantity and the length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude.
Vectors that are in one dimension can be added arithmetically.
Vectors that are in two dimensions are added geometrically.
When vectors are added graphically, graphs must be done to scale and answers are only as accurate as the graphing.

scalar:
A quantity, such as mass, length, or speed, that is completely specified by its magnitude and has no direction.
vector:
A quantity possessing both magnitude and direction, represented by an arrow the direction ofwhich indicates the direction of the quantity and the length of which is proportional to the magnitude.
vector addition:
The process of finding one vector that is equivalent to the result of the successive application of two or more given vectors.
