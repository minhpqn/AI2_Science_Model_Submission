Structure of ethene, as well as well it can be found
The bananas on the left were stored in a special bag that absorbs ethene.
The bananas on the right were stored without a bag.
Alkenes can have different shapes.
They can form straight chains, branched chains, or rings.
Alkenes with the same atoms but different shapes are called isomers.
Smaller alkenes have relatively high boiling and melting points, so they are gases at room temperature.
Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points, so they are liquids or waxy solids at room temperature.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons called aromatic hydrocarbons are cyclic hydrocarbons that have double bonds.
These compounds have six carbon atoms in a ring with alternating single and double bonds.
The smallest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene, which has just one ring.
Its structural formula is shown in the Figure below .
Larger aromatic hydrocarbons consist of two or more rings, which are joined together by bonds between their carbon atoms.
The name of aromatic hydrocarbons comes from their strong aroma, or scent.
Thatâ€™s why they are used in air fresheners and mothballs.
