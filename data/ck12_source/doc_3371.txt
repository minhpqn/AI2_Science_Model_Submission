As long as the conductor is part of a closed circuit, current will flow through it whenever it crosses lines of force in the magnetic field.
One way this can happen is illustrated in the Figure below .
The sketch shows a magnet moving through a wire coil.

Q:
What is another way that a coil of wire and magnet can move relative to one another and generate an electric current?
A:
The coil of wire could be moved back and forth over the magnet.
The Current Produced by a Magnet
The device with the pointer in the Figure above is an ammeter.
It measures the current that flows through the wire.
The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced.
If more turns were added to the coil or a stronger magnet were used, this would produce more current as well.
The Figure below shows the direction of the current that is generated by a moving magnet.
If the magnet is moved back and forth repeatedly, the current keeps changing direction.
In other words, alternating current (AC) is produced.
Alternating current is electric current that keeps reversing direction.
