Punnett Squares - Advanced
Outline how a Punnett Square helps predict outcomes of genetic crosses.
What do you get when you cross an apple and an orange?
Though the above fruit may not result, it would be nice to scientifically predict what would result.
The ability to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring is important for many reasons.
Predicting the possibility of a genetic cross is often aided by a Punnett square.
Predicting Genotypes with Punnett Squares
Mendel developed the law of segregation by following only a single characteristic, such as pod color, in his pea plants.
Biologists use a diagram called a Punnett square , to help predict the probable inheritance of alleles in different crosses.
The Punnett square is named after its developer, British geneticist Reginald C.
Punnett.
In a monohybrid cross , such as the one in Figure below , the Punnett square shows every possible combination when combining one maternal (mother) allele with one paternal (father) allele.
In this example, both organisms are heterozygous for flower color Bb (purple).
Both plants produce gametes that contain both the B and b alleles.
