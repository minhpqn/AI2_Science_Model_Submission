Magma is melted rock.
What an igneous rock looks like is determined by two things.
One is the composition of the magma.
The other is how fast the magma cools.
The rate of cooling determines the texture of the rock.
Different igneous rocks contain minerals with different compositions.
Mafic igneous rocks contain mafic minerals.
Mafic minerals are dense and dark in color.
They typically contain iron and magnesium; they are low in silica.
Olivine and pyroxene are mafic minerals.
Olivine and pyroxene are mafic igneous rocks
Olivine is the green mineral, pyroxene is the black mineral.
Felsic igneous rocks contain felsic minerals.
They typically contain aluminum and sodium; they are high in silica.
Quartz and potassium feldspar are felsic minerals.
Minerals and rocks with a composition in between mafic and felsic are called intermediate.
Feldspar and quartz are felsic igneous rocks
Potassium feldspar is the pink mineral, plagioclase feldspar is the white mineral, and quartz is the gray mineral.
Magma cools to form igneous rocks.
Two factors determine what type of rock forms.
