The trillions of red blood cells in blood plasma carry oxygen.
Red blood cells contain hemoglobin , a protein with iron that binds with oxygen.
Red blood cells are made in the marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and the vertebrae.
These cells survive for about 120 days, and then they are destroyed.
Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and other organelles, allowing for more hemoglobin, and therefore more oxygen to be carried by each cell.
White blood cells are generally larger than red blood cells but far fewer in number.
They defend the body against foreign bacteria, viruses and other pathogens.
For example, white blood cells called phagocytes swallow and destroy microorganisms and debris in the blood, neutrophils engulf bacteria and other parasites, and lymphocytes fight infections caused by bacteria and viruses.
Platelets are cell fragments involved in blood clotting.
They stick to tears in blood vessels and to each other, forming a plug at the site of injury.
They also release chemicals that are needed for clotting to occur.

Blood type is a genetic characteristic associated with the presence or absence of certain molecules, called antigens , on the surface of red blood cells.
The most commonly known blood types are the ABO and Rhesus blood types.
ABO blood type is determined by two common antigens, often referred to simply as antigens A and B.
A person may have blood type A (only antigen A), B (only antigen B), AB (both antigens), or O (no antigens).
Rhesus blood type is determined by one common antigen.
