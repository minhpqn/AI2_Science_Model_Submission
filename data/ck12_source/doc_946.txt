Bombardment of nuclei with alpha particles or neutrons can often produce a nuclear reaction.
Consider the bombardment of nitrogen-14 by an alpha particle,
{^4_2 \text{He}}+{^{14}_{\phantom{0}7} \text{N}} \rightarrow {^1_1 \text{H}}+{^{17}_{\phantom{0}8} \text{O}}
or the bombardment of uranium-235 by a neutron.
{^{235}_{\phantom{0}92}\text{U}}+{^1_0 n} \rightarrow {^{89}_{36} \text{Kr}} + {^{144}_{\phantom{0}56} \text{Ba}}+3 \ {^1_0 n}
Large unstable nuclei often become more stable by breaking into smaller pieces.
The breakup of a larger nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei is called fission .
Small nuclei often become more stable by joining together to form larger nuclei.
This process is called fusion .
Here is a reaction showing the fusion of a hydrogen-2 atom and a hydrogen-3 atom.
{^2_1 \text{H}}+{^3_1 \text{H}} \rightarrow {^4_2 \text{He}}+{^1_0 n}
The disintegration of unstable nuclei does not occur all at once.
The rate of disintegration is a statistical process.
The most convenient way to consider it is by a concept known as half-life .
The time required for half of the atoms in any given quantity of a radioactive substance to decay is the half-life of that element.
Each particular isotope has its own half-life.
For example, the half-life of radium-226 is 1600 years.
That is, beginning with 1.00 gram of radium-226, it would take 1600 years for half of it to decay and leave 0.50 gram remaining.
After another 1600 years, only 0.25 gram would remain.
In each half-life, exactly half of the beginning amount decays.
