For example, fluorine will oxidize gold metal according to the following reaction.
3\text{F}_2(g)+2\text{Au}(s) \rightarrow 6\text{F}^-(aq)+2\text{Au}^{3+}(aq)
Lithium metal (Li) is the strongest reducing agent.
It is capable of reducing any substance above on the table.
For example, lithium will reduce water according to this reaction.
2\text{Li}(s)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{Li}^+(aq)+2\text{OH}^-(aq)+\text{H}_2(g)
Using the Table above will allow you to predict whether reactions will occur or not.
For example, nickel metal is capable of reducing copper(II) ions, but is not capable of reducing zinc ions.
This is because nickel (Ni) is below Cu 2+ , but is above Zn 2+ in the table.
