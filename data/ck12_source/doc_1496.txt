It even affects the seas far from shore.
The oceans are most polluted along coasts.
Why do you think that's the case?
Of course, it's because most pollution enters the oceans from the land.
Runoff and rivers carry the majority of pollution into the ocean.
Many cities dump their wastewater , water mixed with waste, directly into coastal waters.
In some parts of the world, raw sewage and trash may be thrown into the water ( Figure below ).
Coastal water may become so polluted that people get sick if they swim in it or eat seafood from it.
The polluted water may also kill fish and other ocean life.
Beach filled with garbage
This coastal ocean water is full of trash and sewage.
Much of the trash in the oceans is plastic.
Many types of plastic do not degrade.
Some break down into plastic molecules, but these can also be a pollutant.
Plastic shopping bags are extremely abundant in the oceans.
Since water runs from land into the sea, chemicals can end up in the sea.
Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers are among the chemicals.
Open Water Pollution
Most of the trash that is in the oceans comes from the land.
About 20% comes from ships.
