This division separates the sister chromatids.
After cytokinesis, four haploid cells result, each with 23 chromosomes.
Now each chromosome contains the equivalent of material from one chromatid.
Thus, when two of these cells join in fertilization, the resulting diploid zygote has just as much DNA as a cell after mitotic cell division.
In prophase II, once again the nucleolus disappears and the nucleus breaks down.
The chromatin condenses into chromosomes.
The spindle begins to reform as the centrioles move to opposite sides of the cell.
During metaphase II, the spindle fibers align the 23 chromosomes, each made out of two chromatids, along the equator of the cell.
The new metaphase plate is rotated by 90 degrees when compared to meiosis I, perpendicular to the previous plate.
Anaphase II separates chromatids, similar to anaphase of mitosis.
During anaphase II, sister chromatids are separated as the centromeres are cleaved.
The chromatids move to opposite poles of the cell.
As the chromatids separate, each is known as a chromosome.
Anaphase II results in a cell with 23 chromosomes at each pole of the cell; each chromosome contains half as much genetic material as at the start of anaphase II.
Telophase II and cytokinesis end meiosis.
During this last phase of meiosis, the nucleus reforms and the spindle fibers break down.
The chromosomes uncoil into chromatin.
Each cell undergoes cytokinesis, producing four haploid cells, each with a unique combination of genes and chromosomes.
Meiosis, divided into meiosis I and meiosis II, is a process in which a diploid cell divides itself into four haploid cells.
Note that meiosis II immediately follows meiosis I;
