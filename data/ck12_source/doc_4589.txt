Why is it so important?
Your kidneys filter and remove wastes from your blood.
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs just above the waist.
They are important organs with many functions in the body, including producing hormones, absorbing minerals, and filtering blood and producing urine.
A cross-section of a kidney is shown in Figure below .
The function of the kidney is to filter blood and form urine.
Urine is the liquid waste product of the body that is excreted by the urinary system.
Wastes in the blood come from the normal breakdown of tissues, such as muscles, and from food.
The body uses food for energy.
After the body has taken the nutrients it needs from food, some of the wastes are absorbed into the blood.
If the kidneys did not remove them, these wastes would build up in the blood and damage the body.
Kidneys and Nephrons
The actual removal of wastes from the blood occurs in tiny units inside the kidneys called nephrons.
Nephrons are the structural and functional units of the kidneys.
A single kidney may have more than a million nephrons!
This is further discussed in the Urinary System concept.
Each kidney is supplied by a renal artery and renal vein.
Kidneys and Homeostasis
The kidneys play many vital roles in homeostasis .
They work with many other organ systems to do this.
