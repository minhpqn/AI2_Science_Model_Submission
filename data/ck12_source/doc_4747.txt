The study of how the human body works is called physiology.
Zoology is the study of animals.
The study of how organisms interact with their environment and each other is called ecology.
Evolutionary biology is the study of how populations and species change over time.
Botany is the study of plants.
The four unifying principles are important foundations for each and every field of biology.
Applied fields of biology such as medicine and genetic research involve many specialized areas of study.
What is Life?
Not all scientists agree exactly about what makes up life.
Many characteristics describe most living things.
However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something non-living being classified as living or something living being classified as non-living.
There is not just one distinguishing feature that separates a living thing from a non-living thing.
A cat moves but so does a car.
A tree grows bigger, but so does a cloud.
A cell has structure, but so does a crystal.
Biologists define life by listing characteristics that living things share.
Something that has all of the characteristics of life is considered to be alive.
The duck decoy in Figure below may look like a duck, act like a duck in that it floats about, but it is not alive.
The decoy cannot reproduce, respond to its environment, or breathe.
