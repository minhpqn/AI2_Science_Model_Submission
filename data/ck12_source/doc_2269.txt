Our solar system, including the Sun, Earth, and all the other planets, is within one of the spiral arms in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy.
Most of the stars we see in the sky are also in this spiral arm.
We are about 26,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy.
We are a little more than halfway out from the center of the galaxy to the edge.
Just as Earth orbits the Sun, the solar system orbits the center of the galaxy.
Astronomers have recently discovered that at the center of the Milky Way and most other galaxies, is a supermassive black hole.
