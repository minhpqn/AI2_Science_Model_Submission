However, similar to alcohols, amines can be primary, secondary, or tertiary.
Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines
The nitrogen atom of a primary amine is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one carbon.
The nitrogen atom of a secondary amine is bonded to one hydrogen and two carbons.
The nitrogen atom of a tertiary amine is bonded to three carbon atoms.
Amines are typically named by a common system rather than by IUPAC guidelines.
The common system for naming amines along with several examples is shown below.
Name the alkyl groups that are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine.
If there is more than one different alkyl group, put them in alphabetical order.
If there are two or three of the same alkyl group, use the di− or tri− prefix.
Follow the alkyl group name with the suffix –amine , with no spaces.
Nomenclature of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines
Properties of Amines
Amines are weak bases due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.
This lone pair can attract the hydrogen atom from a water molecule, causing the bond between it and the oxygen atom to break.
The resultant products are the conjugate acid of the amine and the hydroxide ion.
Reaction where an amine acts as a base
Amines are capable of hydrogen bonding though their boiling points are generally a bit lower than the corresponding alcohol.
Methylamine and ethylamine are gases at room temperature, while larger amines are liquids.
As with other organic compounds that form hydrogen bonds, water solubility is reflected in the length of the carbon chains.
