The ball bearings in this wheel reduce friction between the inner and outer cylinders when they turn.
Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through a fluid.
A fluid is a substance that can flow and take the shape of its container.
Fluids include liquids and gases.
If you’ve ever tried to push your open hand through the water in a tub or pool, then you’ve experienced fluid friction.
You can feel the resistance of the water against your hand.
Look at the skydiver in the Figure below .
He’s falling toward Earth with a parachute.
Resistance of the air against the parachute slows his descent.
The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater is the fluid friction resisting its motion.
That’s why there is greater air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver’s body.
Parachutes work using fluid friction
Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact.
There are four types of friction: static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction.
Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces.
Static friction is strongest, followed by sliding friction, and then rolling friction, which is weakest.
Fluid friction occurs in fluids, which are liquids or gases.
Simulate sliding and rolling friction with your choice of vehicle in the animation at the following URL.
Vary each parameter in turn and observe how it affects the ability of the vehicle to avoid a crash.
Then use your observations to answer the questions below.
