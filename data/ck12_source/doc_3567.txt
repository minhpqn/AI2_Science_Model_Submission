Describe the significance of the photosynthesis oxygen product.
Describe how the energy of the excited electrons is harvested.
Explain the role of ATP synthase.
Oxygen has been described as a ‘‘waste product’’.
How is this possible?
Essentially, oxygen is a waste product of the light reactions of photosynthesis.
It is a ‘‘leftover’’ from a necessary part of the process.
All the oxygen that is necessary to maintain most forms of life just happens to come about during this process.

Chloroplasts Capture Sunlight
Every second, the sun fuses over 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596 tons of helium, converting over 4 tons of helium (4.3 billion kg) into light and heat energy.
Countless tiny packets of that light energy travel 93 million miles (150 million km) through space, and about 1% of the light which reaches the Earth’s surface participates in photosynthesis.
Light is the source of energy for photosynthesis, and the first set of reactions which begin the process requires light – thus the name, light reactions , or light-dependent reactions.
When light strikes chlorophyll (or an accessory pigment) within the chloroplast, it energizes electrons within that molecule.
These electrons jump up to higher energy levels; they have absorbed or captured, and now carry, that energy.
High-energy electrons are “excited.” Who wouldn’t be excited to hold the energy for life?
The excited electrons leave chlorophyll to participate in further reactions, leaving the chlorophyll “at a loss”; eventually they must be replaced.
