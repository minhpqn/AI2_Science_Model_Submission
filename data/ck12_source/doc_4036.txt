Protists and Fungi-1
Would you eat this mushroom?
Now that's an interesting mushroom!
In fact, fungi can be some of the most colorful species.
And protists can be some of the most interesting.
These two kingdoms which have some of the most diverse members are the first two eukaryotic kingdoms we discuss in the Protists and Fungi chapter.
This quintessential toadstool, the fly agaric or fly Amanita, is a poisonous and psychoactive fungus.
It has a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually deep red mushroom, and it is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture.
You should not eat it.
Describe the protist kingdom.
Prokaryote or eukaryote?
This organism consists of a single cell with several flagella.
Is it a prokaryote, such as a bacterium?
Actually, it’s larger than a prokaryotic cell, and it also has a nucleus.
Therefore, this organism belongs to the domain Eukarya, the domain that includes humans.
This particular eukaryote is one of the smallest, simplest organisms in the domain, called a protist.
It’s scientific name is Giardia lamblia.
As a human parasite, it can make us sick.
Protists are a group of all the eukaryotes that are not fungi, animals, or plants.
As a result, it is a very diverse group of organisms.
