What does point  C represent?
phase diagram:
A graph which the conditions of temperature and pressure under which a substance exists in the solid, liquid, and gas.
triple point:
The one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.
Phase Diagram for Water
Describe the phase diagram for water.
Define critical temperature.
Define critical pressure.
A snowball can be made by compressing dry snow to partially melt the ice
How is it possible to create snowballs?
You need a special snow to make the best snowballs.
This snow needs to be a little wet so the particles will stick together.
Dry snow can be tightly pressed and will form snowballs because the higher pressure causes the snowflakes to melt somewhat.
However, when you release the pressure, the snow goes back to a more solid form and the flakes no longer stick together.
Phase Diagram for Water
Water is a unique substance in many ways.
One of these special properties is the fact that solid water (ice) is less dense than liquid water just above the freezing point.
The phase diagram for water is shown in the Figure below .
The phase diagram of water is special because the solid-liquid phase line has a negative slope
