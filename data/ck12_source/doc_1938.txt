Paleozoic and Mesozoic Seas
Describe the causes of marine transgressions and regressions.
Do you like the beach?
If so, the Paleozoic may be for you!
If we were living right now at the time of a marine transgression, there would be a lot more beach.

Marine Transgressions and Regressions
Sea level rises and falls.
During the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, the seas rose over the continents.
This is called a marine transgression .
During a marine regression , the sea level retreats.
The Paleozoic had four complete cycles of marine transgressions and regressions.
The Mesozoic had two ( Figure below ).
Six marine transgressions and regressions have occurred during the Phanerozoic
