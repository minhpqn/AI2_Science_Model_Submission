The particles of gases are relatively far apart, so they don’t bump into each other or into other things as often as the more closely spaced particles of liquids or solids.
Therefore, particles of gases have fewer opportunities to transfer thermal energy.
Materials that are poor thermal conductors are called thermal insulators .
Down-filled snowsuits, like those in the Figure below , are good thermal insulators because their feather filling traps a lot of air.
Insulators help snowsuits keep heat in
Another example of a thermal insulator is pictured in the Figure below .
The picture shows fluffy pink insulation inside the attic of a home.
Like the down filling in a snowsuit, the insulation traps a lot of air.
The insulation helps to prevent the transfer of thermal energy into the house on hot days and out of the house on cold days.
Other materials that are thermal insulators include plastic and wood.
That’s why pot handles and cooking utensils are often made of these materials.
Notice that the outside of the toaster pictured in the opening image is made of plastic.
The plastic casing helps prevent the transfer of thermal energy from the heating element inside to the outer surface of the toaster where it could cause burns.
