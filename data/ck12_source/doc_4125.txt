Picture of the geologic time scale
The geologic time scale of Earth's past is organized according to events that took place during different periods on the time scale.
Geologic time is the same as the age of the Earth: between 4.404 and 4.57 billion years.
Look closely for such events as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine animals.
Evolution of Major Life Forms
Life on Earth began about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago.
The first life forms were single-celled organisms similar to bacteria.
The first multicellular organisms did not appear until about 610 million years ago.
Many different types of organisms evolved during the next ten million years, in an event called the Cambrian Explosion .
This sudden burst of evolution may have been caused by some environmental changes that made the Earth's environment more suitable for a wider variety of life forms.
Plants and fungi did not appear until roughly 500 million years ago.
They were soon followed by arthropods (insects and spiders).
Next came the amphibians about 300 million years ago, followed by mammals around 200 million years ago and birds around 100 million years ago.
Even though large life forms have been very successful on Earth, most of the life forms on Earth today are still prokaryotesâ€”small, relatively simple single-celled organisms.
Fossils indicate that many organisms that lived long ago are extinct.
Extinction of species is common; in fact, it is estimated that 99% of the species that have ever lived on Earth no longer exist.
The basic timeline of a 4.6 billion-year-old Earth includes the following:
