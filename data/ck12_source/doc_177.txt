In scientific notation, the mass of a lead atom is 3.4 × 10 -34 g, and the distance from our galaxy to the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 × 10 19 km.
A number is expressed in scientific notation by moving the decimal so that exactly one non-zero digit is on the left of the decimal and the exponent of 10 will be the number of places the decimal was moved.
If the decimal is moved to the left, the exponent is positive and if the decimal was moved to the right, the exponent is negative.
All significant figures are maintained in scientific notation.
Significant figures are explained below.
Example:
Express 13,700,000,000 in scientific notation.
Solution:
Since the decimal will be moved to the left 10 places, the exponent will be 10.
So, the correct notation is 1.37 × 10 10 .
Example:
Express 0.000000000000000074 in scientific notation.
Solution:
Since the decimal will be moved to the right 17 places, the exponent will be -17.
So the correct scientific notation is 7.4 × 10
Example:
Express the number 8.43 × 10 5 in expanded form.
Solution: 10 5 is 100,000 so 8.43 × 10 5 is 8.43 × 100,000 or 843,000.
Operations with Exponential Numbers
In order to add or subtract numbers in scientific notation, the exponents must be the same.
