\text{velocity} & =\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\\\& =\frac{36 \ \text{m}}{18 \ \text{s}}\\\& =2 \ \text{m/s east}
Note that the answer is given in the SI unit for velocity, which is m/s, and it includes the direction that the dog is traveling.
Q:
What would the dogâ€™s velocity be if it ran the same distance in the opposite direction but covered the distance in 24 seconds?
A:
In this case, the velocity would be:
\text{velocity} & =\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\\\& =\frac{36 \ \text{m}}{24 \ \text{s}}\\\& =1.5 \ \text{m/s west}
Velocity is a measure of both speed and direction of motion.
Velocity is a vector, which is a measurement that includes both size and direction.
Velocity can be represented by an arrow, with the length of the arrow representing speed and the way the arrow points representing direction.
Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same speed and in the same direction.
Objects moving at different speeds, in different directions, or both have different velocities.
The average velocity of an object moving in a constant direction is calculated with the formula: \text{velocity}=\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} .
The SI unit for velocity is m/s, plus the direction the object is traveling.
