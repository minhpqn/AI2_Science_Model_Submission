Helium has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus and two electrons moving around the nucleus.
Atoms of other elements have different numbers of subatomic particles, but the number of protons always equals the number of electrons.
This makes atoms neutral in charge because the positive and negative charges “cancel out.”

Q:
Lithium has three protons, four neutrons, and three electrons.
Sketch a model of a lithium atom, similar to the model above for helium.
A:
Does your sketch resemble the model in the Figure below ?
The model has three protons (blue) and four neutrons (gray) in the nucleus, with three electrons (red) moving around the nucleus.

Q:
All atoms of carbon have six protons.
How many electrons do carbon atoms have?
A:
Carbon atoms must have six electrons to “cancel out” the positive charges of the six protons.
That’s because atoms are always neutral in electric charge.
Atoms are the building blocks of matter.
