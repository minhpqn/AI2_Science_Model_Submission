These are summarized in Table below .
Refer back to the table as you read about the events in this concept. *mya = millions of years ago
Rise of human civilization; spread and dominance of modern humans
Spread and then extinction of many large mammals; appearance of modern humans
Appearance of many existing genera of mammals, including the genus Homo
Appearance of remaining modern mammal families; diversification of horses and mastodons; first apes
Rapid evolution and diversification of placental mammals
Appearance of several modern mammal families; diversification of primitive whales
Appearance of the first large mammals
Emergence of monotreme, marsupial, and placental mammals; possible first appearance of four clades (superorders) of placental mammals (Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, Supraprimates)
Spread of mammals, which remain small in size
Evolution of cynodonts to become smaller and more mammal-like; appearance of the first mammals
Evolution and spread of synapsids (pelycosaurs and therapsids)
Appearance of amniotes, the first fully terrestrial vertebrates
Ancestors of mammals evolved close to 300 million years ago.
They were amniotes called synapsids .
Figure below shows how modern mammals evolved from synapsids.
The stages of evolution from synapsids to mammals are described below.
