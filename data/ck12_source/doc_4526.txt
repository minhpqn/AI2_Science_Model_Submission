On the other hand, because endocrine hormones are released into the bloodstream, they travel throughout the body.
As a result, endocrine hormones can affect many cells and have body-wide effects.
Glands of the Endocrine System
The major glands of the endocrine system are shown in Figure below .
You can access a similar, animated endocrine system chart at the link below.
Endocrine system components
The glands of the endocrine system are the same in males and females except for the testes, which are found only in males, and ovaries, which are found only in females.
The hypothalamus is actually part of the brain (see Figure below ), but it also secretes hormones .
Some of its hormones “tell” the pituitary gland either to secrete or to stop secreting its hormones.
In this way, the hypothalamus provides a link between the nervous and endocrine systems.
The hypothalamus also produces hormones that directly regulate body processes.
These hormones travel to the pituitary gland, which stores them until they are needed.
The hormones include antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin.
Antidiuretic hormone stimulates the kidneys to conserve water by producing more concentrated urine.
Oxytocin stimulates the contractions of childbirth, among other functions.
Hypothalamus and pituitary gland
The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are located close together at the base of the brain.
The pea-sized pituitary gland is attached to the hypothalamus by a thin stalk (see Figure above ).
It consists of two bulb-like lobes.
The posterior (back) lobe stores hormones from the hypothalamus.
