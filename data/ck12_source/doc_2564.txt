Elements in the same group have similar properties.
For example, all elements in group 18 are colorless, odorless gases, such as neon (Ne). (Neon is the element inside the light in opening photo C.) In contrast, all elements in group 1 are very reactive solids.
They react explosively with water, as you can see in the video and Figure below .

Classes of Elements
All elements can be classified in one of three classes: metals, metalloids, or nonmetals.
Elements in each class share certain basic properties.
For example, elements in the metals class can conduct electricity, whereas elements in the nonmetals class generally cannot.
Elements in the metalloids class fall in between the metals and nonmetals in their properties.
An example of a metalloid is arsenic (As). (Arsenic is the element in opening photo B.) In the periodic table above, elements are color coded to show their class.
As you move from left to right across each period of the table, the elements change from metals to metalloids to nonmetals.
Q:
To which class of elements does copper (Cu) belong: metal, metalloid, or nonmetal?
Identify three other elements in this class.
A:
In the Figure above , the cell for copper is colored blue.
This means that copper belongs to the metals class.
Other elements in the metals class include iron (Fe), sodium (Na), and gold (Au).
