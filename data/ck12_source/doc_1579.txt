These forms of oxygen do not protect the planet from ultraviolet radiation.
CFCs break down ozone in the stratosphere
CFCs break down ozone in the stratosphere.
Most ozone loss it taking place over the South Pole and Antarctica.
This is the location of the ozone hole.
The ozone hole is a region in the stratosphere where there is less ozone than normal.
Conditions are just right for ozone destruction because it is exceedingly cold.
The ozone hole is also seasonal.
The hole forms during the early part spring in the Southern Hemisphere and then grows northward ( Figure below ).
The ozone layer is also thinner over the Northern Hemisphere.

The hole in the ozone layer occurs over Antarctica.
How do you think the hole in the ozone layer could affect life on Earth?
Effects of Ozone Loss
With less ozone in the stratosphere, more UV rays reach the ground.
More UV rays increase skin cancer rates.
Just a 1 percent loss of ozone causes a 5 percent increase in skin cancer.
More UV rays also harm plants and phytoplankton.
As a result, they produce less food.
This may affect entire ecosystems.
