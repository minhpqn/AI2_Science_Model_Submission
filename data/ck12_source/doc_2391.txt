A:
Examples include extremely small things such as atoms, very distant objects such as stars, and complex systems such as the electric grid that carries electricity throughout the country.
Q:
What are ways that these things might be modeled?
A:
Types of models include two-dimensional diagrams, three-dimensional structures, mathematical formulas, and computer simulations.
Examples of simple two-dimensional models in physical science are described below.

Simple Models in Physical Science
The diagram below is a simple two-dimensional model of a water molecule.
This is the smallest particle of water that still has the properties of water.
The model shows that each molecule of water consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen.
Q:
What else can you learn about water molecules from this model?
A:
The model shows the number of atomic particles—protons, neutrons, and electrons—in each type of atom.
It also shows that each hydrogen atom in a water molecule shares its electron with the oxygen atom.
