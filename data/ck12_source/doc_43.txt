We are Homo sapiens.
Homo is the genus of great apes that includes modern humans and closely related species, and sapiens is the only living species of the genus.
Defining a Species
Even though naming species is straightforward, deciding if two organisms are the same species can sometimes be difficult.
Linnaeus defined each species by the distinctive physical characteristics shared by these organisms.
But two members of the same species may look quite different.
For example, people from different parts of the world sometimes look very different, but we are all the same species ( Figure below ).
So how is a species defined?
A species is defined as a group of similar individuals that can interbreed with one another and produce fertile offspring.
A species does not produce fertile offspring with other species.
This group of children are all members of the same species
These children are all members of the same species, Homo sapiens .
Scientists have defined several major categories for classifying organisms: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.
The scientific name of an organism consists of its genus and species.
