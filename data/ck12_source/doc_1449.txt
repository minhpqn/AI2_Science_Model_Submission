If this happens, the ground above the aquifer may sink.
This is likely to damage any homes or other structures built above the aquifer.
Most groundwater does not flow out of an aquifer as a spring or geyser.
So to use the water that's stored in an aquifer, people must go after it.
How?
They dig a well.
A well ( Figure below ) is a hole that is dug or drilled through the ground down to an aquifer.

A well runs from the surface to a point below the water table.
Why must a well go lower than the water table?
People have depended on water from wells for thousands of years.
To bring water to the surface takes energy because the force of gravity must be overcome.
Today, many wells use electricity to pump water to the surface.
However, in some places, water is still brought to the surface the old-fashioned wayâ€”with human labor.
The well pictured below ( Figure below ) is an example of this type of well.
A hand-cranked pulley is used to lift the bucket of water to the surface.
This old water well uses human muscle power to bring water to the surface

An aquifer is a saturated layer of rock or soil.
Most groundwater use is from wells.
