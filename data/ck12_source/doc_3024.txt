That’s because of momentum.
What Is Momentum?
Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop.
The more mass it has or the faster it’s moving, the greater its momentum.
Momentum equals mass times velocity and is represented by the equation:
Momentum = Mass × Velocity
Q :
What is Cody’s momentum as he stands at the top of the ramp?
A :
Cody has no momentum as he stands there because he isn’t moving.
In other words, his velocity is zero.
However, Cody will gain momentum as he starts moving down the ramp and picks up speed.
Q :
Cody’s older brother Jerod is pictured in the Figure below .
If Jerod were to travel down the ramp at the same velocity as Cody, who would have greater momentum?
Who would be harder to stop?
A :
Jerod obviously has greater mass than Cody, so he would have greater momentum.
He would also be harder to stop.
