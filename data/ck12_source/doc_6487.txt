Ouch, that hurts
Alessandro Volta developed the first “voltaic cell” in 1800 (pictured above).
This battery consisted of alternating disks of zinc and silver with pieces of cardboard soaked in brine separating the disks.
Since there were no voltmeters at the time (and no idea that the electric current was due to electron flow), Volta had to rely on another measure of battery strength: the amount of shock produced (it’s never a good idea to test things on yourself).
He found that the intensity of the shock increased with the number of metal plates in the system.
Devices with twenty plates produced a shock that was quite painful.
It’s a good thing we have voltmeters today to measure electric current instead of the “stick your finger on this and tell me what you feel” method.
Two variations on the basic voltaic cell are the dry cell and the lead storage battery.
Many common batteries, such as those used in a flashlight or remote control, are voltaic dry cells.
These batteries are called dry cells because the electrolyte is a paste.
They are relatively inexpensive, but do not last a long time and are not rechargeable.
Structure of a zinc carbon dry cell
A zinc-carbon dry cell.
In the zinc-carbon dry cell, the anode is a zinc container, while the cathode is a carbon rod through the center of the cell.
The paste is made of manganese(IV) oxide (MnO 2 ), ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), and zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ) in water.
The half-reactions for this dry cell are:
Anode (oxidation): \text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^-
Cathode (reduction): 2\text{MnO}_2(s) + 2{\text{NH}_4}^-(aq)+2e^- \rightarrow \text{Mn}_2\text{O}_3(s) + 2\text{NH}_3(aq) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
The paste prevents the contents of the dry cell from freely mixing, so a salt bridge is not needed.
The carbon rod is a conductor only and does not undergo reduction.
