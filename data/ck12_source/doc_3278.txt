The speed of visible light through Heinz® vinegar is about 230 million m/s.
When light passes from one medium to another, it changes speed.
For example, when light passes from air to glass, it slows down.
If light strikes a sheet of glass at a 90° angle, or perpendicular to the glass, it slows down but still passes straight through the glass.
However, if light enters the glass at an angle other than 90°, the light bends as it slows down.
The bending of light as it changes speed in a new medium is called refraction .
The Figure below shows how refraction occurs.
Notice that the speed of light changes again as it passes from the glass back to the air.
In this case, the speed increases, and the ray of light resumes its initial direction.
For a more detailed explanation of refraction, watch this video:

What’s Your Angle?
The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed.
The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is.
For example, light refracts more when it passes from air to diamond than it does when it passes from air to water.
That’s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it is in water.
Q:
Now can you explain why the straw in the opening image appears to be broken where it enters the water?
A:
The straw appears to be broken because of refraction.
