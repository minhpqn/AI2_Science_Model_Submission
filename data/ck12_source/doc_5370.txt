The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.
wobble base pair :
A non-Watson-Crick base pairing between two nucleotides in RNA molecules.
Wobble Hypothesis :
States that rules of base pairing are relaxed at the third position of a codon, so that a base can pair with more than one complementary base.
The genetic code consists of the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA.
Groups of three bases form codons, and each codon stands for one amino acid (or start or stop).
Start and stop codons signal the beginning and end of translation; the codons are read in sequence following the start codon until a stop codon is reached.
The reading frame is the frame of three bases in which the mRNA is read.
The genetic code is universal, unambiguous, and redundant.

Describe the role of the Genetic Code in translation.
What is a reading frame?
Use the genetic code to translate the following segment of RNA into a sequence of five amino acids:
GUC-GCG-CAU-AGC-AAG.
The genetic code is universal, unambiguous, and redundant.
Explain what this means and why it is important.
