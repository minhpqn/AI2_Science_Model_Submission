Hence, matter is continuously recycled, resulting in the so called "circle of life." The carbon and other elements of organisms are recycled to be used by other living organisms.
This law also states that in a chemical reaction, or a biochemical reaction , as mass cannot be created or destroyed, the mass of the reactants must equal the mass of the products.
In other words, the atoms in the starting materials must be equivalent to the atoms in the ending materials.
biochemical reaction :
Chemical reaction within a cell or organism; usually controlled by an enzyme.
boiling point :
The temperature at which a liquid changes state into a gas.
gas :
State of matter in which atoms or molecules have enough energy to move freely.
law of conservation of mass :
Law that states that the mass of an isolated system will remain constant over time.
liquid :
State of matter in which atoms or molecules are constantly in contact but have enough energy to keep changing positions relative to one another.
melting point :
The temperature at which a solid changes state into a liquid.
solid :
State of matter in which atoms or molecules do not have enough energy to move.
state of matter :
Condition that matter is in, depending on how much energy its atoms or molecules have.
Matter can exist in one of several different states, including a gas, liquid, or solid state.
