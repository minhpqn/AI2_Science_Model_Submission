Schematic of a laser
Besides entertaining a cat, laser light has many other uses.
One use is carrying communication signals in optical fibers.
Sounds or pictures are encoded in pulses of laser light, which are then sent through an optical fiber.
All of the light reflects off the inside of the fiber, so none of it escapes.
As a result, the signal remains strong even over long distances.
More than one signal can travel through an optical fiber at the same time, as you can see in the Figure below .
Optical fibers are used to carry telephone, cable TV, and Internet signals.
Schematic of an optical fiber
The optical fiber in the diagram is much larger than a real optical fiber, which is only about as wide as a human hair.
Q:
When lasers were invented in 1960, they were called "a solution looking for a problem.‚Äù Since then, they have been put to thousands of different uses.
Can you name other ways that lasers are used?
A:
The first widespread use of lasers was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974.
The compact disc (CD) player was the first laser-equipped device commonly used by consumers, starting in The CD player was quickly followed by the laser printer.
Some other uses of lasers include bloodless surgery, cutting and welding of metals, guiding missiles, thermometers, laser light shows, and acne treatments.
Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to extend human vision and do other tasks.
Optical instruments are based on optics.
