The equation for wave speed can be written to solve for wavelength or frequency if the speed and the other value are known.
The speed of most waves depends on the medium, or the matter through which they are traveling.
Generally, waves travel fastest through solids and slowest through gases.
Practice calculating wave speed from wavelength and frequency by doing the problems at this URL:
What is wave speed?
What is the speed of a wave that has a wavelength of 2 m and a frequency of 1.5 Hz?
Calculate the frequency of a wave that is traveling at a speed of 3.0 m/s and has a wavelength of 1.2 m.
Sound energy travels through matter in waves.
Do sound waves travel faster through air or water?
Explain your answer.
Identify ways that waves can interact with matter.
Define and give examples of wave reflection, refraction, and diffraction.
Did you ever hear an echo of your own voice?
An echo occurs when sound waves bounce back from a surface that they canâ€™t pass through.
The woman pictured here is trying to create an echo by shouting toward a large building.
When the sound waves strike the wall of the building, most of them bounce back toward the woman, and she hears an echo of her voice.
An echo is just one example of how waves interact with matter.
How Waves Interact with Matter
Waves interact with matter in several ways.
The interactions occur when waves pass from one medium to another.
