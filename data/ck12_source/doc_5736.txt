Mendeleev reversed the order because he knew that the properties of iodine were much more similar to those of fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and bromine (Br) than they were to oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se).
He simply assumed that there was an error in the determination of one or both of the atomic masses.
As we will see shortly, this turned out not to be the case, but Mendeleev was indeed correct to group these two elements as he did.
Notice that there are several places in the table that have no chemical symbol, but are instead labeled with a question mark.
Between zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) are two such missing elements.
Mendeleev believed that elements with atomic masses of 68 and 70 would eventually be discovered and that they would fit chemically into each of those spaces.
Listed in the Table below are other properties that Mendeleev predicted for the first of these two missing elements, which he called “eka-aluminum,” compared with the element gallium.
5.9 g/cm 3
5.94 g/cm 3
Formula of oxide
Ea 2 O 3
Ga 2 O 3
The element gallium was discovered four years after the publication of Mendeleev’s table, and its properties matched up remarkably well with eka-aluminum, fitting into the table exactly where he had predicted.
This was also the case with the element that followed gallium, which was named eventually named germanium.
Mendeleev’s periodic table gained wide acceptance with the scientific community and earned him credit as the discoverer of the periodic law.
Element number 101, synthesized in 1955, is named mendelevium after the founder of the periodic table.
It would, however, be several years after Mendeleev died before the several discrepancies with the atomic masses could be explained and before the reasons behind the repetition of chemical properties could be fully explained.

Mendeleev published his periodic table in 1869.
