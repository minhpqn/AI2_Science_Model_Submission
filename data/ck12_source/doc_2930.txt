Usually, a child will receive one chromosome 21 from the mother and one chromosome 21 from the father.
In an individual with Down syndrome, however, there are three copies of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ).
Therefore, Down syndrome is also known as Trisomy 21.
These people have 47 total chromosomes.

Notice the extra chromosome 21.
Another example of a chromosomal disorder is Klinefelter syndrome , in which a male inherits an extra “X” chromosome.
These individuals have an XXY genotype.
They have underdeveloped sex organs and elongated limbs.
They also have difficulty learning new things.
Outside of chromosome 21 and the sex chromosomes, most embryos with extra chromosomes do not usually survive.
Because chromosomes carry many, many genes, a disruption of a chromosome can cause severe problems with the development of a fetus.
Individuals with one (or more) fewer chromosome usually don't survive either.
Can you explain why?
Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome becomes damaged.
For example, if a tiny portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the individual will have cri du chat (cat’s cry) syndrome.
These individuals have misshapen facial features, and the infant’s cry resembles a cat’s cry.
