What is a neutralization reaction?
What is a salt?
Write the net ionic equation for the neutralization of a strong acid and a strong base.
neutralization reaction:
A reaction in which an acid and a base react in an aqueous solution to produce a salt and water.
salt:
An ionic compound composed of a cation from a base and an anion from an acid.
Define equivalence point.
Describe how to perform a titration experiment.
Biodiesel synthesis requires the amount of acid to be determined before adding lye
Didnâ€™t that used to be French fries?
A lot of research is going on these days involving the development of biodiesel fuels.
Often this material can be made from used vegetable oils.
The vegetable oil is treated with lye to create the biofuel.
In the oils is a variable amount of acid that needs to be determined so the workers will know how much lye to add to make the final fuel.
Before the lye is added, the native vegetable oil is titrated to find out how much free acid is present.
Then the amount of lye added can be adjusted to take into account the amount needed to neutralize these free acids.
In the neutralization of hydrochloric acid by sodium hydroxide, the mole ratio of acid to base is 1:1.
\text{HCl}(aq)+\text{NaOH}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
One mole of HCl would be fully neutralized by one mole of NaOH.
