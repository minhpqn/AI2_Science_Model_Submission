For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss.
Environmental stimuli that indicate changing seasons trigger other responses.
Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant .
They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme cold and dryness of winter.
Dormancy ensures that seeds will germinate and plants will grow only when conditions are favorable.
Responses to Disease
Plants donâ€™t have immune systems, but they do respond to disease.
Typically, their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding infected tissue.
This prevents the infection from spreading.
Many plants also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens.
For example, willow trees produce salicylic acid to kill bacteria.
The same compound is used in many acne products for the same reason.
Exciting new research suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other plants of threats to their health, allowing the plants to prepare for their own defense.
As these and other responses show, plants may be rooted in place, but they are far from helpless.

Plant Plague:
Sudden Oak Death
Devastating over one million oak trees across Northern California in the past ten years, Sudden Oak Death is a killer with no cure.
But biologists now are looking to the trees' genetics for a solution.
