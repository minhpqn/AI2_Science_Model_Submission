Kinetic energy is the energy of movement.
For example, a ball falling through the air has kinetic energy because it is moving ( Figure below ).
The random motion of molecules is due to kinetic energy, and the driving force behind diffusion.
Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position.
A bouncing ball at the top of a bounce, just before it starts to fall, has potential energy.
For that instant, the ball is not moving, but it has the potential to move because gravity is pulling on it.
Once the ball starts to fall, the potential energy changes to kinetic energy.
When the ball hits the ground, it gains potential energy from the impact.
The potential energy changes to kinetic energy when the ball bounces back up into the air.
As the ball gains height, it regains potential energy because of gravity.
Energy in a bouncing ball is transformed from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy.
This cycle of energy changes keeps repeating as long as the ball continues to bounce.
The ball rises less on each successive bounce because some energy is used to resist air molecules.
Like the ball, every time you move you have kinetic energy â€” whether you jump or run or just blink your eyes.
Can you think of situations in which you have potential energy?
Obvious examples might include when you are standing on a diving board or at the top of a ski slope or bungee jump.
What gives you potential energy in all of these situations?
The answer is gravity.
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) :
Energy-carrying molecule that cells use to power their metabolic processes; energy-currency of the cell.
