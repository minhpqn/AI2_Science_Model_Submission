Trenches are found near chains of active volcanoes.
An example is the line of the very deepest blue, off of western South America.
abyssal plains :
Flat areas that may be dotted with volcanic mountains.
An example is the consistent blue off of southeastern South America.
guyots :
Flat topped mountains that appear to have been eroded.
Yet these mountains are thousands of feet below sea level.
continental margin :
The transition from the land to the deep sea.
The continental margin is made of continental crust.
More than one-quarter of the ocean basin is continental margin.
See if you can identify each of these features on the map (( Figure below )) below.

Of course the first scientists to observe these features wondered how they had formed.
It turns out that they were crucial for fitting together ideas about seafloor spreading.
And seafloor spreading would turn out to be the mechanism for continental drift.
Echo sounders were used to search for enemy submarines during World War II.
The depths they recorded allowed scientists to piece together bathymetric maps of the seafloor.
