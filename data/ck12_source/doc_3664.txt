Explain how probability is related to inheritance.
Describe the relationship of probability to gamete formation and fertilization.
What are the odds of landing on 25 again?
Not as high as inheriting an allele from a parent.
Probability plays a big role in determining the chance of inheriting an allele from a parent.
It is similar to tossing a coin.
What's the chance of the coin landing on heads?
Assume you are a plant breeder trying to develop a new variety of plant that is more useful to humans.
You plan to cross-pollinate an insect-resistant plant with a plant that grows rapidly.
Your goal is to produce a variety of plant that is both insect resistant and fast growing.
What percentage of the offspring would you expect to have both characteristics?
Mendel’s laws can be used to find out.
However, to understand how Mendel’s laws can be used in this way, you first need to know about probability.
Probability is the likelihood, or chance, that a certain event will occur.
The easiest way to understand probability is with coin tosses (see Figure below ).
When you toss a coin, the chance of a head turning up is 50 percent.
This is because a coin has only two sides, so there is an equal chance of a head or tail turning up on any given toss.
Flipping a coin is similar to genetic inheritance
Tossing a Coin.
Competitions often begin with the toss of a coin.
