In a double bond, they share two pairs of electrons, and in a triple bond they share three pairs of electrons.
Examples of compounds with these types of bonds are represented by the structural formulas in the Figure below .
Carbon-carbon bonds with different bond orders
Q:
How many bonds do the carbon atoms share in each of these compounds?
A:
In ethane, the two carbon atoms share a single bond.
In ethene they share a double bond, and in ethyne they share a triple bond.
Carbon forms covalent bonds with atoms of carbon or other elements.
There is a great diversity of carbon compounds, ranging in size from just one to thousands of atoms.
Carbon has four valence electrons, so it can achieve a full outer energy level by forming four covalent bonds.
When it bonds only with hydrogen, it forms compounds called hydrocarbons.
Carbon can form single, double, or triple covalent bonds with other carbon atoms.
