All life needs other life to survive.
Here surgeon fish are feeding on the algae growth on this turtle shell, a classic example of two species needing each other.
This is an example of a symbiotic relationship.
Interdependence of Living Things
All living things depend on their environment to supply them with what they need, including food, water, and shelter.
Their environment consists of physical factors—such as soil, air, and temperature—and also of other organisms.
An organism is an individual living thing.
Many living things interact with other organisms in their environment.
In fact, they may need other organisms in order to survive.
This is known as interdependence .
For example, living things that cannot make their own food must eat other organisms for food.
Other interactions between living things include symbiosis and competition.
Symbiosis is a close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits.
The other organism may also benefit, it may be unaffected by the relationship, or it may be harmed by the relationship.
Figure below shows an example of symbiosis.
The birds in the picture are able to pick out food from the fur of the deer.
The deer won't eat the birds.
In fact, the deer knowingly lets the birds rest on it.
What, if anything, do you think the deer gets out of the relationship?
