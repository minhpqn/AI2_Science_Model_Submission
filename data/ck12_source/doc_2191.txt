Mars has mountains, canyons, and other features similar to Earth.
But it doesnâ€™t have as much geological activity as Earth.
There is no evidence of plate tectonics on Mars.
There are also more craters on Mars than on Earth.
But there are fewer craters than on the Moon.

Pictured below is an image of the Martian surface ( Figure below ).
Surface features of Mars
Mars is Earth's second nearest neighbor planet.
A Red Planet
Viewed from Earth, Mars is red.
This is due to large amounts of iron in the soil.
The ancient Greeks and Romans named the planet Mars after the god of war because the planet's red color reminded them of blood.
Mars has only a very thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide.
Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system:
Olympus Mons ( Figure below ).
Olympus Mons is a shield volcano.
The volcano is similar to the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands.
