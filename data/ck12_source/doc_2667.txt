What is electricity?
Why can metals conduct electricity?
What can metals conduct besides electricity?
How could you use an empty pop can to demonstrate that metals can bend without breaking?
What are metallic bonds?
How do metallic bonds relate to the properties of metals?
The iron in the metal working picture above ( Figure above ) is red hot.
Infer why the metalworker heats the iron when he shapes it.
Describe examples of alloys.
Metals such as iron are useful for many purposes because of their unique properties.
For example, they can conduct electricity and bend without breaking.
However, pure metals may be less useful than mixtures of metals with other elements.
For example, adding a little carbon to iron makes it much stronger.
This mixture is called steel.
Steel is so strong that it can hold up huge bridges, like the one pictured above.
Steel is also used to make skyscrapers, cargo ships, cars, and trains.
Steel is an example of an alloy.
What Are Alloys?
An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other elements.
