This means gathering evidence in field studies; collecting samples of water from a river is one example of this method.
Case Study:
River Water Pollution
The environmental scientist above will gather samples of river water in several different locations.
Then he will take the samples back to a lab to analyze them.
He will do tests to identify any pollutants in the samples.
Taking samples from different locations may help him identify the source of any pollution he finds.
Pollution can enter a river from a single source, such as a waste water pipe from a factory.
This is called point-source pollution.
Or pollution can enter a river in runoff rainwater that picks up pollutants as it runs over the ground.
This type of pollution enters the river everywhere.
This is called nonpoint-source pollution.
Q:
Assume that the river is polluted only by nonpoint-source pollution.
Describe how the samples of river water would compare in terms of the pollutants they contain.
A:
All of the samples would contain about the same amount and types of pollutants.
Q:
How might point-source pollution be identified?
A:
