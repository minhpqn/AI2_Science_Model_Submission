Two forms of tubulin, alpha and beta, form dimers (pairs) which come together to form the hollow cylinders.
The cylinders are twisted around each other to form the microtubules.
Microtubules help the cell keep its shape.
They hold organelles in place and allow them to move around the cell, and they form the mitotic spindle during cell division.
Microtubules also make up parts of cilia and flagella, the organelles that help a cell move.
Microfilaments , shown in Figure below (b) , are made of two thin actin chains that are twisted around one another.
Microfilaments are mostly concentrated just beneath the cell membrane, where they support the cell and help the cell keep its shape.
Microfilaments form cytoplasmatic extensions, such as pseudopodia and microvilli, which allow certain cells to move.
The actin of the microfilaments interacts with the protein myosin to cause contraction in muscle cells.
Microfilaments are found in almost every cell, and are numerous in muscle cells and in cells that move by changing shape, such as phagocytes (white blood cells that search the body for bacteria and other invaders).
Intermediate filaments differ in make-up from one cell type to another.
Intermediate filaments organize the inside structure of the cell by holding organelles and providing strength.
They are also structural components of the nuclear envelope.
Intermediate filaments made of the protein keratin are found in skin, hair, and nails cells.
Images of cytoskeleton and microfilaments
(a) The eukaryotic cytoskeleton.
Microfilaments are shown in red, microtubules in green, and the nuclei are in blue.
By linking regions of the cell together, the cytoskeleton helps support the shape of the cell. (b) Microscopy of microfilaments (actin filaments), shown in green, inside cells.
The nucleus is shown in blue.
