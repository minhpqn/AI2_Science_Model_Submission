If we stuck a piece of tape somewhere on the rope, we would see that the particles of medium do not travel with the energy.
After the wave has passed by, the piece of tape would still be in the same place it was before the wave approached.
In all transverse waves, the movement media vibrates perpendicularly to the direction of wave motion, and the medium is not permanently moved from one place to another.
Frequency, Wavelength, and Velocity
Waves are identified by several characteristics.
There is a center line where the medium would be if there were no wave, which is sometimes describes as the undisturbed position.
The displacement of the medium above this undisturbed position is called a crest and the displacement below the undisturbed position is called a trough .
The maximums of the crest and trough are equal and are called the amplitude .
The distance between equivalent positions on succeeding waves is called the wavelength .
The wavelength could be measured from a crest to the next crest or from a trough to the next trough, and is commonly represented with the Greek letter lambda, \lambda .
Parts of a transverse wave
The time interval required for one complete wave to pass a point is called the period .
During the period of the wave, an entire wavelength from one crest to the next crest passes a position.
The number of waves that pass a single position in one second is called the frequency .
The period of a wave and its frequency are reciprocals of each other.
The units for the period are seconds and the units for frequency are s -1 or \frac{1}{\text{s}} .
This unit has also been given the name Hertz (Hz).
Another important characteristic of a wave is its velocity.
The wave velocity is different from the velocity of the medium; the wave velocity is the velocity of the linearly transferred energy.
Since the energy travels one wavelength, \lambda , in one period, T , the velocity can be expressed as distance over time:
