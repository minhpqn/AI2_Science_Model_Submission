This will lead to flooding in a different location.
Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood.
Sandbags create levees to try to stop a flood
Sandbags are put out to try to keep floodwaters from overtaking a town.
Effects of Floods

Within the floodplain of the Nile, soils are fertile enough for productive agriculture.
Beyond this, infertile desert soils prevent viable farming.
Amazingly, floods can be good.
Flood waters carry nutrients that are deposited on the floodplain.
So floodplains are good places for farming.
In the past, the Nile River ( Figure above ) in Egypt flooded each year.
The flood waters brought much-needed nutrients in to farms.
In the 1960s Egypt built the Aswan Dam to protects crop and settlements from the floods.
However, after the dam was built, farmers began to need fertilizers to feed their crops.
“Floods 101” is a National Geographic video found in Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Landslides, and more:
Too much water in a drainage will result in a flood.
Floods are made worse when vegetation is cleared, when the land is already soaked, or when hillsides have been logged.
People build dams and levees to protect from flooding.
In an emergency, sandbags can be put out.
