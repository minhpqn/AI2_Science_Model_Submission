At the following URL, explore the interaction between a compass and Earth’s magnetic field.
Move the compass around the planet and observe what happens to the needle.
Also observe what happens to the compass when you flip polarity (in other words, when a magnetic field reversal occurs).
Describe your observations.
Make a sketch of Earth’s magnetic field.
Explain the northern lights in terms of Earth’s magnetic field.
How is a loggerhead turtle like a compass?
State the right hand rule.
Explain why electromagnetism is very useful.
What a clever dog!
He wants to go inside to get out of the rain, so he’s ringing the doorbell.
Does your home have a doorbell?
Did you ever wonder how a doorbell works?
The answer is electromagnetism.
What Is Electromagnetism?
Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current.
When electric current flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field that surrounds the wire in circles.
You can see this in the diagram below.
Note that electric current is conventionally shown moving from positive to negative electric potential, as in this diagram.
However, electrons in current actually flow in the opposite direction, from negative to positive potential.
