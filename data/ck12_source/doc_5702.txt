de Broglie Wave Equation
Planck’s investigation of the emission spectra of hot objects and the subsequent studies into the photoelectric effect had proven that light was capable of behaving both as a wave and as a particle.
It seemed reasonable to wonder if electrons could also have a dual wave-particle nature.
In 1924, French scientist Louis de Broglie (1892-1987) derived an equation that described the wave nature of any particle.
Particularly, the wavelength (\lambda) of any moving object is given by:
In this equation,  h is Planck’s constant, m is the mass of the particle in kg, and  v is the velocity of the particle in m/s.
The problem below shows how to calculate the wavelength of the electron.
Sample Problem: de Broglie Wave Equation
An electron of mass 9.11 × 10 -31 kg moves at nearly the speed of light.
Using a velocity of 3.00 × 10 8 m/s, calculate the wavelength of the electron.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
mass  (m) = 9.11 × 10 -31 kg
Planck's constant  (h) = 6.6262  10 -34 × J • s
velocity (v) = 3.00 × 10 8 m/s
Apply the de Broglie wave equation \lambda=\frac{h}{mv} to solve for the wavelength of the moving electron.
Step 2:
Calculate
\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}=\frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}\ \text{J} \cdot \text{s}}{(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \ \text{kg}) \times (3.00 \times 10^8 \ \text{m/s})}=2.42 \times 10^{-12} \ \text{m}
Step 3:
