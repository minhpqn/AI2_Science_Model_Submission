Give an overview of molds.
Compare slime molds to water molds.
What grows just about anywhere there is decaying material?
Mold.
This slime mold, shown growing on dead wood, is a fungus-like protist.
Though this mold does not have a mouth, essentially it is still “eating” this decaying material.
Fungus-Like Protists:
Molds
Fungus-like protists are molds .
They are absorptive feeders on decaying organic matter.
They resemble fungi, and they reproduce with spores as fungi do.
However, in other ways, they are quite different from fungi and more like other protists.
For example, they have cell walls made of cellulose , whereas fungi have cell walls made of chitin.
Like other protists, they have complicated life cycles with both asexual and sexual reproduction.
They are motile during some stages of their life cycle.
Two major types of fungus-like protists are slime molds and water molds.
Slime molds are fungus-like protists commonly found on rotting logs and compost.
They move very slowly in search of decaying matter to eat.
When food is scarce, individual cells swarm together to form a blob-like mass, like the “dog vomit” slime mold in the Figure below .
The mass glides along on its own secretions, engulfing decaying organic matter as it moves over it.
