But how does all this information, all these nucleotides, form the molecule known as DNA?
It took the work of four distinguished scientists, three distinguished gentlemen one under-appreciated legendary woman, to solve this mystery.
The Double Helix
In the early 1950s, Rosalind Franklin started working on understanding the structure of DNA fibers.
Franklin, together with Maurice Wilkins, used her expertise in x-ray diffraction photographic techniques to analyze the structure of DNA.
In February 1953, Francis Crick and James D.
Watson of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University had started to build a model of DNA.
Watson and Crick indirectly obtained Franklin's DNA X-ray diffraction data demonstrating crucial information into the DNA structure.
Francis Crick and James Watson ( Figure below ) then published their double helical model of DNA in Nature on April 25th, 1953:
James Watson (left, about the time of the discovery of the double helix) and Francis Crick (right, photo taken many years later).
DNA has the shape of a double helix , just like a spiral staircase ( Figure below ).
As a nucleic acid, DNA is composed of nucleotide monomers, consisting of the deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (A, C, G or T).
There are two sides to the double helix, called the sugar-phosphate backbone , as they are made from alternating phosphate groups and deoxyribose sugars.
The “steps” of the double helix are made from the base pairs formed between the nitrogenous bases.
The DNA double helix is held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases attached to the two strands.
The DNA double helix.
The two sides are the sugar-phosphate backbones, composed of alternating phosphate groups and deoxyribose sugars.
The nitrogenous bases face the center of the double helix.
As the base-pairing rules tell us, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C.
