Additional Practice Questions:
We have a large charged hollow sphere with a small hole in one side.
The charge on the sphere is 1.00 C.
We insert another conducting sphere through the hole on an insulating stick and touch the inside of the charged hollow sphere and bring the second sphere outside the large sphere.
What will be the charge on the second sphere?
Why does a charged object lose its charge when it is touched to the ground?
If a charged rubber rod is placed on a wooden table, the rubber rod will keep its charge for a long time.
Why doesn’t the rod lose its charge immediately?
Both a 3.3×10 -6 F and a 6.8×10 -6 F capacitor are connected across a 15.0 V potential difference.
Which capacitor has a greater charge and what is that charge?
The two plates of a capacitor hold +2.5×10 -3 C and -2.5×10 -3 C of charge when the potential difference is 950 V.
What is the capacitance?
The potential difference between two parallel wires in air is V.
They hold equal and opposite charges of 9.5×10 -11 C.
What is the capacitance of the two wires?
How much charge flows from a 12.0 V battery when it is connected to a 9.00 microfarad capacitor?
