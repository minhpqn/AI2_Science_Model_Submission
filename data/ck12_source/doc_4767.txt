Another growing subject is the study of comparative anatomy, which looks at how different organisms have similar body structures.
Molecular biology studies of slowly changing genes reveal an evolutionary history that is consistent with fossil and anatomical records.
evolution :
The change in the characteristics of living organisms over time; the change in species over time.
geochronology :
The study of the age of rocks.
isotope :
An atom of a different form of the same element.
natural selection :
Evolutionary process by which certain beneficial traits becomes more common within a population, changing the characteristics (traits) of a species over time.
paleontology :
The study of fossils.
stratigraphy :
The study of rock layers.
Analysis of the DNA of different organisms indicate that there is a similarity in the genetic codes that help make proteins and other molecules in very different organisms.
The theory of evolution by natural selection is based on the concept of the survival of the fittest, where individuals with beneficial traits are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment in which they live.
