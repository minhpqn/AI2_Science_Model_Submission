Other animals and plants also need the right nutrients to live.
How Matter Moves Through Ecosystems
Living things need nonliving matter as well as energy.
What do you think matter is used for?
It's used to build bodies.
It's also needed to carry out the processes of life.
Any nonliving matter that living things need is called a nutrient .
Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients.
Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems.
In the figure below, you can see how ( Figure below ).
Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms.
The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots.
The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants.
The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers.
When living things die, the cycle repeats.
Cycle of energy and matter in an ecosystem
This diagram shows two cycles.
One is the cycle of energy, the other is the cycle of matter.
Compare the two cycles.
Do you see how the Sun keeps adding energy?
