The brain stem is the smallest of the three main parts of the brain.
It lies directly under the cerebrum.
The brain stem controls basic body functions, such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion.
The brain stem also carries information back and forth between the cerebrum and spinal cord.

Top view of the brain ( left ).
The cerebrum is divided into a right and left half ( Figure above ).
Each half of the cerebrum is called a hemisphere.
The two hemispheres are connected by a thick bundle of axons called the corpus callosum .
It lies deep inside the brain and carries messages back and forth between the two hemispheres.
Did you know that the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body?
By connecting the two hemispheres, the corpus callosum allows this to happen.
Each hemisphere of the cerebrum is divided into four parts, called lobes.
The four lobes are the:
Each lobe has different jobs.
Some of the functions are listed below ( Table below ).
Speech, thinking, touch
Speech, taste, reading
