As the vehicle moves past you, the waves are spread apart.
This effect with light tells astronomers something about our Universe.
The Universe is Expanding
After discovering that there are galaxies outside our own, Edwin Hubble went on to measure the distance to hundreds of other galaxies.
His data would eventually show us how the Universe is changing, and even give us clues as to how the Universe formed.
If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum .
The spectrum is the range of colors seen in a rainbow.
The spectrum has specific dark bands where elements in the star have absorbed light of certain energies.
An astronomer can use these lines to determine which elements are in a distant star.
In fact, the element helium was first discovered in our Sun, not on Earth.
This was done by analyzing the absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun.
Astronomers studied the spectra of light from distant galaxies.
When they did this they noticed something strange.
The dark lines in the spectrum were in the patterns they expected.
But they were shifted toward the red end of the spectrum ( Figure below ).
This shift of absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum is known as redshift .
Stars are redshifted because they are moving away from the earth
Redshift is a shift in absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum.
Redshift occurs when the light source is moving away from you or when the space between you and the source is stretched.
Redshift occurs when the source of light is moving away from the observer.
