Seeing in Three Dimensions
Did you ever use 3-D glasses to watch a movie, like the boy pictured below ( Figure below )?
If you did, then you know that the glasses make people and objects in the movie appear to jump out of the screen.
They make images on the flat movie screen seem more realistic because they give them depth.
That’s the difference between seeing things in two dimensions and three dimensions.
Your eyes automatically sees objects in three dimensions
This boy is wearing 3-D glasses; when you look at objects and people in the real world, your eyes automatically see in three dimensions.
We are able to see in three dimensions because we have two eyes facing the same direction but a few inches apart.
As a result, we see objects and people with both eyes at the same time but from slightly different angles.
Hold up a finger a few inches away from your face, and look at it, first with one eye and then with the other.
You’ll notice that your finger appears to move.
Now hold up your finger at arm’s length, and look at it with one eye and then the other.
Your finger seems to move less than it did when it was closer.
Although you aren’t aware of it, your brain constantly uses such differences to determine the distance of objects.
Seeing in Color
For animals like us that see in color, it may be hard to imagine a world that appears to be mainly shades of gray.
You can get an idea of how many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture of colorful objects.
For example, look at the apple on the tree pictured below ( Figure below ).
In the top picture, they appear in color, the way you would normally see them.
In the bottom picture they appear without color, in shades of gray ( Figure below ).
