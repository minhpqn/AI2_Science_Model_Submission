An increase in the number of gas particles causes an increase in the pressure of a gas
Increase in pressure with increase in number of gas particles.
The canister on the left contains a gas at a certain pressure.
The attached air pump is then used to double the amount of gas in the canister.
Since the canister cannot expand, the increased number of air molecules will strike the inside walls of the canister twice as frequently as they did before.
The result is that the pressure inside the canister doubles.
As you might imagine, if more and more air is continually added to a rigid container, it may eventually burst.
Reducing the number of molecules in a rigid container has the opposite effect and the pressure decreases.
Pressure is also affected by the volume of the container.
If the volume of a container is decreased, the gas molecules have less space in which to move around.
As a result, they will strike the walls of the container more often and the pressure increases.
Figure below shows a cylinder of gas whose volume is controlled by an adjustable piston.
On the left, the piston is pulled mostly out and the gauge reads a certain pressure.
On the right, the piston has been pushed so that the volume of the enclosed portion of the container where the gas is located has been cut in half.
The pressure of the gas doubles.
Increasing the volume of the container would have the opposite effect and the pressure of the gas would decrease.
A decrease in volume causes an increase in pressure for a gas
Decrease in gas volume produced increase in gas pressure.
It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can.
As the can heats up, it may explode.
