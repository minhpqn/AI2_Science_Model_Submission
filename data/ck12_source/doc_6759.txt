Remember: you can only use conservation of momentum to solve a problem involving an inelastic collision
Question :
Two blocks collide on a frictionless surface.
Afterwards, they have a combined mass of 10kg and a speed of 2.5\mathrm{m/s} .
Before the collision, block A, which has a mass of 8.0kg, was at rest.
What was the mass and initial speed of block B?
Solution :
To find mass of block B we have a simple subtraction problem.
We know that the combined mass is 10kg and the mass of block A is 8.0kg. 10\mathrm{kg}-8.0\mathrm{kg}=2.0\mathrm{kg}
Now that we know the mass of both blocks we can find the speed of block B.
We will use conservation of momentum.
This was a completely inelastic collision.
We know this because the blocks stuck together after the collision.
This problem is one dimensional, because all motion happens along the same line.
Thus we will use the equation (m_A+m_B)v_f=m_A\times v_A+m_B\times v_B and solve for the velocity of block B. (m_A+m_B)v_f=m_A\times v_A+m_Bv_B \Rightarrow \frac{(m_A+m_B)(v_f)-(m_A)(v_A)}{m_B}=v_B
