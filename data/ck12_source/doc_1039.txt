But it meets the requirements.
These are the things we know: (1) average global temperatures are rising, (2) greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, (3) CO 2 is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned, (4) CO 2 is a greenhouse gas, (5) more CO 2 in the atmosphere traps more heat so global temperature is rising.
No information contradicts this theory, although some details have not been worked out.
The theory is very effective at predicting future events, which are already taking place.
This idea will be explored in detail in the chapter Atmospheric Processes .
Many people think that any idea that is completely accepted in science is a law.
But that is not true.
In science, a law is something that always applies under the same conditions.
A law explains a fairly simple phenomenon.
A theory is much more complex: it tells you why something happens.
A law only tells you that it happens.
For example, if you hold something above the ground and let go, it will fall.
This phenomenon is recognized by the law of gravity ( Figure below ).
Some people say that evolution is "just a theory." But for a complex explanation like evolution, theory is the right word.
Skydiving is possible because of the law of gravity
Skydiving is possible because of the law of gravity.
A theory is an explanation of a complex phenomenon.
A theory tells why something happens.
A theory can be used to predict future events.
A law describes something that always happens under the same set of circumstances.
