The normal freezing point of water is 0.0째C.
Therefore, since the freezing point decreases by 24.0째C, the freezing point of the solution is -24.0째C.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The freezing point of the water decreases by a large amount, protecting the radiator from damage due to the expansion of water when it freezes.
There are three significant figures in the result.
Freezing point depression is defined.
Calculations involving freezing point depression are described.
Solve the problems at the site below:
How does a solute affect the freezing of water?
How many moles of glucose would be needed to lower the freezing point of one kg of water 3.72째C?
How many moles of NaCl would be needed to produce the same amount of lowering of temperature?
freezing point depression:
The difference in temperature between the freezing point of the pure solvent and that of the solution.
molal freezing-point depression constant:
A constant that is equal to the change in the freezing point for a 1-molal solution of a nonvolatile molecular solute.
Boiling Point Elevation
Define boiling point elevation.
Calculate the boiling point of a solution when given the molal boiling-point elevation constant.
