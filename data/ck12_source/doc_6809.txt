Your task:
Match the period of the circular motion system with that of the spring system.
You are only allowed to change the velocity involved in the circular motion system.
Consider the effective distance between the block and the pivot to be to be fixed at 1m.
The spring constant(13.5N/m) is also fixed.
You should view the charts to check whether you have succeeded.
Instructions:
To alter the velocity, simply click on the Select Tool, and select the pivot .
The Position tab below will allow you to numerically adjust the rotational speed using the Motor field.
To view the graphs of their respective motion in order to determine if they are in sync, click on Chart tab below.
