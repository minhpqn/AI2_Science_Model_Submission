How Ocean Currents Moderate Climate
Describe how surface ocean currents moderate climate.
Explain how the Gulf Stream alters climate in the British Isles.
How do ocean currents create giant redwoods?
The California Current brings cool water south along the western United States.
Cool water contacting warmer water creates fog.
This creates a favorable habitat for the giant redwoods of the northern California coast.
Surface Currents and Climate
Large ocean currents can have a big impact on climate, especially of nearby coasts.
The Equator and the poles have very different climates today.
But these regions woud be much more different without ocean surface currents.
These currents move heat around the globe.
The best known of these is the Gulf Stream , which warms parts of Europe.
