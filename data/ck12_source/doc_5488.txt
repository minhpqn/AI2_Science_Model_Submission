Improved yield from crops.
Reduced vulnerability of crops to environmental stresses.
Increased nutritional qualities of food crops.
Improved taste, texture or appearance of food.
Reduced dependence on fertilizers, pesticides and other agrochemicals.
Production of vaccines.
Creating a Transgenic Crop.
A transgenic crop is genetically modified to be more useful to humans.
The bacterium transfers the T-DNA (from the Ti plasmid) fragment with the desired gene into the host plant's nuclear genome.

Improved Yield from Crops
Using biotechnology techniques, one or two genes may be transferred into a crop to give a new trait to that crop.
This is done in the hope of increasing its yield.
However, these increases in yield have proved to be difficult to achieve.
Current genetic engineering techniques work best for single gene effects - that is traits inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion.
Many of the genetic characteristics associated with crop yield, such as enhanced growth, are controlled by a large number of genes, each of which just has a slight effect on the overall yield.
There is, therefore, still much research, including plant genetic research, to be done in this area.
Reduced Vulnerability to Environmental Stresses
Crops are obviously dependent on environmental conditions.
