The focus of this concept is to delineate the distinct differences between plant and animal cells.
Special Structures in Plant Cells
Most of the organelles that have been discussed in other concepts, such as ribosomes, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, are common to both animal and plant cells.
However, plant cells also have features that animal cells do not have; they have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts.
They also have junctions called plasmodesmata.
Plants have very different lifestyles from animals, and these differences are apparent when you examine the structure of the plant cell.
Plants have to make their own food, and they do so in a process called photosynthesis .
They take in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) and convert them into sugars.
The features unique to plant cells can be seen in Figure below .
In addition to containing most of the organelles found in animal cells, plant cells also have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids.
These three features are not found in animal cells.
A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell.
The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well.
In fact, two other classes of polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and pectic polysaccharides, can comprise 30% of the dry mass of the cell wall.
The cell wall provides structural support and protection.
Pores in the cell wall allow water and nutrients to move into and out of the cell.
The cell wall also prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell.
Microtubules guide the formation of the plant cell wall.
Cellulose is laid down by enzymes to form the primary cell wall.
Some plants also have a secondary cell wall.
