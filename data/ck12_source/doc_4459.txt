For example, one of the most important functions of organ systems is to provide cells with oxygen and nutrients and to remove toxic waste products such as carbon dioxide.
A number of organ systems, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, all work together to do this.

Digests foods and absorbs nutrients, minerals, vitamins, and water.
Pituitary gland, hypothalamus; adrenal glands; ovaries; testes
