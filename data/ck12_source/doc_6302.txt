The addition of a catalyst to a reaction lowers the activation energy, increasing the rate of the reaction.
The activation energy of the uncatalyzed reaction is shown by Ea, while the catalyzed reaction is shown by Ea’.
The heat of reaction (ΔH) is unchanged by the presence of the catalyst.
Catalysts are extremely important parts of many chemical reactions.
Enzymes in your body act as nature’s catalysts, allowing important biochemical reactions to occur at reasonable rates.
Chemical companies constantly search for new and better catalysts to make reactions go faster and thus make the company more profitable.
The function of a catalyst is described.
