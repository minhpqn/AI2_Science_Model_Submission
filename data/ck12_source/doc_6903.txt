A train, moving at some speed lower than the speed of sound, is equipped with a gun.
The gun shoots a bullet forward at precisely the speed of sound, relative to the train.
An observer watches some distance down the tracks, with the bullet headed towards him.
Will the observer hear the sound of the bullet being fired before being struck by the bullet?
Explain.
The speed of sound v in air is approximately 331.4 \ m/s + 0.6 \ T , where T is the temperature of the air in Celsius.
The speed of light c is 300,000 km/sec, which means it travels from one place to another on Earth more or less instantaneously.
Letâ€™s say on a cool night (air temperature 10^\circ Celsius) you see lightning flash and then hear the thunder rumble five seconds later.
How far away (in km) did the lightning strike?
struck by bullet first.
Sound in a Tube
Analyze and solve problems where standing waves are produced in a tube.
Students will learn how to analyze and solve problems where standing waves (and hence sound) is produced in a tube.
v = \lambda f
for a tube closed at one end
f =nv /4L , where n is always odd
for a tube open at both ends
f =nv /2L , where n is an integer
In the case of a tube that is open at one end, a node is forced at the closed end (no air molecules can vibrate up and down) and an antinode occurs at the open end (here, air molecules are free to move).
A different spectrum of standing waves is produced.
