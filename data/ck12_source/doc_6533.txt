When properly structured, propane engines can produce lower amounts of air pollution.
We are seeing a growing use of propane in buses, trucks, and police cars.
Pictured above is a prototype of a minibus that will run on propane fuel.
Maybe your next car will burn propane.
A hydrocarbon is an organic compound that is made up of only carbon and hydrogen.
A hydrocarbon is the simplest kind of organic molecule and is the basis for all other more complex organic compounds.
Hydrocarbons can be divided into two broad categories.
Aliphatic hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that do not contain the benzene group or a benzene ring .
Aromatic hydrocarbons contain one or more benzene rings.
In this concept, we will discuss the aliphatic hydrocarbons.
An alkane is a hydrocarbon in which there are only single covalent bonds.
The simplest alkane is methane, with the molecular formula CH 4 .
The carbon is the central atom and makes four single covalent bonds to hydrogen atoms.
Various representations of the structure of methane
Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon and is shown with a structural formula, a ball-and-stick model, and a space-filling model.
The next simplest alkane is called ethane (C 2 H 6 ) and consists of two carbon atoms with a single covalent bond between them.
Each carbon is then able to bond to three hydrogen atoms.
The alkane series progresses from there, increasing the length of the carbon chain by one carbon at a time.
Structural formulas for ethane, propane (C 3 H 8 ), and butane (C 4 H 10 ) are shown below.
