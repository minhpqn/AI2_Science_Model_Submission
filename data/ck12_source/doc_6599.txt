Why would the one-letter abbreviation system have an advantage?
amino acid:
A compound that contains both an amino group (−NH 2 ) and a carboxyl group (−COOH) bonded to a central carbon in the same molecule.
Describe the formation of the peptide bond.

Are your cells smarter than you?
Cells in our bodies have an intricate mechanism for the manufacture of proteins.
Humans have to use other techniques in order to synthesize the same proteins in a lab.
The chemistry of peptide synthesis is complicated.
Both active groups on an amino acid can react and the amino acid sequence must be a specific one in order for the protein to function.
Robert Merrifield developed the first synthetic approach for making proteins in the lab, a manual approach which was lengthy and tedious (and, he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1984 for his work).
Today however, automated systems can crank out a peptide in a very short period of time.
A peptide is a combination of amino acids in which the amino group of one amino acid has undergone a reaction with the carboxyl group of another amino acid.
The reaction is a condensation reaction, forming an amide group (CO−N), shown below.
Condensation reaction of two amino acids to form a peptide
Amino acids join together to form a molecule called a dipeptide.
The C−N bond is called a peptide bond.
The order of amino acids is by convention shown with the free amino group on the left and the free carboxyl group on the right.
A peptide bond is the amide bond that occurs between the amino nitrogen of one amino acid and the carboxyl carbon of another amino acid.
The resulting molecule is called a dipeptide.
