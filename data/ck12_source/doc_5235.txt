A pedigree is a chart which shows the inheritance of a trait over several generations.
A pedigree is commonly created for families, as it can be used to outlines the inheritance patterns of familial traits or genetic disorders.
It can be used to demonstrate autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance, or sex-linked inheritance.
Figure below shows a pedigree depicting recessive inheritance of a disorder through three generations.
The trait is thought to be recessive as for the two individuals with the trait, neither has a parent who also has the trait.
Geneticists may also be able to determine whether individuals with the trait in question are heterozygous or homozygous for the allele associated with the trait.
When alleles are added to the pedigree shown ( A or a ), recessive inheritance in conformed.
In a pedigree, squares symbolize males, and circles represent females.
A horizontal line joining a male and female indicates that the couple had offspring.
Vertical lines indicate offspring which are listed left to right, in order of birth.
Shading of the circle or square indicates an individual who has the trait being traced.
The inheritance of the recessive trait is being traced.
A is the dominant allele and a is recessive.
An "affected" individual has the trait or characteristic (or disease) in question.

Sex-linked or Autosomal?
A sex chromosome is a chromosome that determines the sex of an organism.
Humans have two sex chromosomes, X and Y .
Females have two X chromosomes ( XX ), and males have one X and one Y chromosome ( XY ).
An autosome is any chromosome other than a sex chromosome.
