How does the Exploratorium demonstrate the relationship between simple harmonic motion and circular motion?
Is it convincing?
Why don't the pendulums all swing at the same rate?
The following website has a set of questions and answers about simple harmonic motion.
In simple harmonic motion, when the speed of the object is maximum, the acceleration is zero.
In SHM, maximum displacement of the mass means maximum acceleration.
If a spring has a spring constant of 1.00 Ã— 10 3 N/m, what is the restoring force when the mass has been displaced 20.0 cm?
simple harmonic motion:
A type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement.
restoring force:
A force that tends to restore a system to equilibrium after displacement.
spring constant:
A characteristic of a spring which is defined as the ratio of the force affecting the spring to the displacement caused by it.
amplitude:
The maximum displacement from equilibrium that occurs in an oscillation.
cycle:
A complete revolution in any repeating motion.
period:
The time required for one complete cycle in any repeating motion.
frequency:
