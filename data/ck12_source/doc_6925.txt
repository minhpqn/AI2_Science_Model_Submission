Describe the parts of a basic electric circuit and apply Ohm's law.
Students will learn a basic understanding of electric circuits and how to apply Ohm's law.
V=IR \;  ;
Voltage drop equals current multiplied by resistance.
P = IV \;  ;
Power released is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current.
Ohm's Law is the main equation for electric circuits but it is often misused.
In order to calculate the voltage drop across a light bulb use the formula:
V_{lightbulb} = I_{lightbulb}R_{lightbulb} .
For the total current flowing out of the power source, you need the total resistance of the circuit and the total voltage:
V_{total} = I_{total}R_{total}
The equations used to calculate the power dissipated in a circuit is P=IV .
As with Ohmâ€™s Law, one must be careful not to mix apples with oranges.
If you want the power of the entire circuit, then you multiply the total voltage of the power source by the total current coming out of the power source.
