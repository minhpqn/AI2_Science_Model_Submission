Wobble base pairs are fundamental in RNA secondary structure and are critical for the proper translation of the genetic code.
Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed from the hydrolytic deamination of adenine.
Structurally, it resembles guanine, but lacks the 2-amino group.
This lack of the 2-amino group allows inosine to form base pairs with uracil, cytosine and adenine, making it a particularly wobbly base.
Degeneracy of the Universal Genetic Code
When there are 64 codon combinations for 20 amino acids (and stop codons), there is going to be some overlap.
Within the genetic code there is redundancy but no ambiguity.
For example, the codons GGG, GGA, GGC, and GGU all encode the amino acid glycine, but none encode another amino acid.
Degenerate codons often differ in the third position.
The genetic code is said to be universal.
That is, the same code is utilized by the simplest prokaryotic organism and by humans.
This universality is a tremendous benefit to mankind.
If a human gene is placed in a bacteria, it looks just like a piece of DNA to the bacteria.
The human As, Cs, Gs, and Ts look just like the bacteriaâ€™s As, Cs, Gs, and Ts.
So, the bacterial proteins will transcribe and translate this DNA, making a human protein.
But how exactly are these proteins made?
We have been referring to mRNAs, tRNAs, ribosomes, codons the genetic code and transcription and translation throughout the concepts.
How do they all come together to make a protein?
Through translation.
