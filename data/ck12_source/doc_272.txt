A bomb, originally sitting at rest, explodes and during the explosion breaks into four pieces of exactly 0.25 kg each.
One piece flies due south at 10 m/s while another pieces flies due north at 10 m/s.
What do we know about the directions of the other two pieces and how do we know it?
What do we know about the speeds of the other two pieces and how do we know it?
In a head-on collision between protons in a particle accelerator, three resultant particles were observed.
All three of the resultant particles were moving to the right from the point of collision.
The physicists conducting the experiment concluded there was at least one unseen particle moving to the left after the collision.
Why did they conclude this?
