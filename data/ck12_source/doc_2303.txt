When another car bumps into yours, both cars may bounce back from the collision.
The harder the two cars collide, the farther back they bounce.
It’s the Law
It may seem like common sense that bumper cars change their motion when they collide.
That’s because all objects behave this way - it’s the law!
A scientific law, called Newton’s third law of motion, states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Thus, when one bumper car acts by ramming another, one or both cars react by pushing apart.
Q:
What are some other examples of Newton’s third law of motion?
What actions are always followed by reactions?
A:
Other examples of actions and reactions include hitting a ball with a bat and the ball bouncing back; and pushing a swing and the swing moving away.
Laws in Science
Newton’s third law of motion is just one of many scientific laws.
A scientific law is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions.
Other examples of laws in physical science include:
Newton’s first law of motion
Newton’s second law of motion
Newton’s law of universal gravitation
Law of conservation of mass
