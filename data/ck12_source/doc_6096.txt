The volume of a given mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas when pressure is kept constant.
State Gay-Lussac’s law.
Use this law to perform calculations involving pressure-temperature relationships.
The temperature of a tank of gas needs to be taken into account when measuring its pressure
How much propane is in the tank?
Propane tanks are widely used with barbeque grills.
But it’s not fun to find out half-way through your grilling that you’ve run out of gas.
You can buy gauges that measure the pressure inside the tank to see how much is left.
The gauge measures pressure and will register a higher pressure on a hot day than it will on a cold day.
So you need to take the air temperature into account when you decide whether or not to refill the tank before your next cook-out.
When the temperature of a sample of gas in a rigid container is increased, the pressure of the gas increases as well.
The increase in kinetic energy results in the molecules of gas striking the walls of the container with more force, resulting in a greater pressure.
The French chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) discovered the relationship between the pressure of a gas and its absolute temperature.
Gay-Lussac’s law states that the pressure of a given mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas, when the volume is kept constant.
Gay-Lussac’s law is very similar to Charles’s law, with the only difference being the type of container.
Whereas the container in a Charles’s law experiment is flexible, it is rigid in a Gay-Lussac’s law experiment.
In Gay-Lussac's Law, the pressure of a gas varies directly with the temperature of a gas
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac.
The mathematical expressions for Gay-Lussac’s law are likewise similar to those of Charles’s law:
\frac{P}{T}=k \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{P_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2}{T_2}
