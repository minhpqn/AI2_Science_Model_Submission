This results in changes in the traits of living things over time.
In Darwin’s day, most people believed that all species were created at the same time and remained unchanged thereafter.
They also believed that Earth was only about 6,000 years old.
Therefore, Darwin’s ideas revolutionized biology.
How did Darwin come up with these important ideas?
It all started when he went on a voyage.
The Voyage of the Beagle
In 1831, when Darwin was just 22 years old, he set sail on a scientific expedition on a ship called the HMS Beagle .
He was the naturalist on the voyage.
As a naturalist, it was his job to observe and collect specimens of plants, animals, rocks, and fossils wherever the expedition went ashore.
The route the ship took and the stops they made are shown in the Figure below .
