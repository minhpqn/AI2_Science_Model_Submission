One done inside the body ( in vivo ).
One done outside the body ( ex vivo ).
Both types of gene therapy use a vector , or carrier molecule for the gene.
The vector helps incorporate the desired gene into the patient's DNA.
Usually this vector is modified viral DNA in which the viral genes have been removed.
Don't worry, the virus used in gene therapy has been deactivated.
In Vivo Gene Therapy
During in vivo gene therapy, done inside the body, the vector with the gene of interest is introduced directly into the patient and taken up by the patient’s cells ( Figure below ).
For example, cystic fibrosis gene therapy is targeted at the respiratory system, so a solution with the vector can be sprayed into the patient’s nose.
Recently, in vivo gene therapy was also used to partially restore the vision of three young adults with a rare type of eye disease.

During gene therapy, adenovirus is a possible vector to carry the desired gene and insert it into the patient's DNA.
A deactivated virus makes a useful vector for this purpose.
Ex Vivo Gene Therapy
In ex vivo gene therapy, done outside the body, cells are removed from the patient and the proper gene is inserted using a virus as a vector.
The modified cells are placed back into the patient.
One of the first uses of this type of gene therapy was in the treatment of a young girl with a rare genetic disease, adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA deficiency.
People with this disorder are missing the ADA enzyme, which breaks down a toxin called deoxyadenosine.
If the toxin is not broken down, it accumulates and destroys immune cells.
As a result, individuals with ADA deficiency do not have a healthy immune system to fight off infections.
