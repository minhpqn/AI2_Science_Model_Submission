Where is your DNA?
You may know that a criminal can easily leave DNA at a crime scene.
How?
DNA is found in every cell of your body.
In each cell there is a nucleus, which is home to your DNA.
So if a criminal has a cut, and blood is left at the crime scene, or a hair falls out and is left behind, then DNA will also be left at the scene.
The nucleus is only found in eukaryotic cells.
