The charge of an ion is indicated by a plus (+) or minus sign (-), which is written to the right of and just above the ionâ€™s chemical symbol.
For example, the fluoride ion is represented by the symbol F - , and the sodium ion is represented by the symbol Na + .
If the charge is greater than one, a number is used to indicate it.
For example, iron (Fe) may lose two electrons to form an ion with a charge of plus two.
This ion would be represented by the symbol Fe 2+ .
This and some other common ions are listed with their symbols in the Table below .

Q:
How does the iron(III) ion differ from the iron(II) ion?
A:
The iron(III) ion has a charge of +3, so it has one less electron than the iron(II) ion, which has a charge of +2.
Q:
What is the charge of an oxide ion?
How does its number of electrons compare to its number of protons?
A:
An oxide ion has a charge of -2.
It has two more electrons than protons.
