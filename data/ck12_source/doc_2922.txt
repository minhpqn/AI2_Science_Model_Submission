This 50:50 chance occurs for each baby.
A couple's first five children could all be boys.
The sixth child still has a 50:50 chance of being a girl.
One special pattern of inheritance that doesn’t fit Mendel’s rules is sex-linked inheritance , referring to the inheritance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes.
Since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes, there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex-linked traits —traits linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes—are expressed.
Sex-linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the X chromosome.
One example of a sex-linked trait is red-green colorblindness.
People with this type of colorblindness cannot tell the difference between red and green.
They often see these colors as shades of brown ( Figure below ).
Boys are much more likely to be colorblind than girls ( Table below ).
This is because colorblindness is a sex-linked, recessive trait.
Boys only have one X chromosome, so if that chromosome carries the gene for colorblindness, they will be colorblind.
As girls have two X chromosomes, a girl can have one X chromosome with the colorblind gene and one X chromosome with a normal gene for color vision.
Since colorblindness is recessive, the dominant normal gene will mask the recessive colorblind gene.
Females with one colorblindness allele and one normal allele are referred to as carriers .
They carry the allele but do not express it.
How would a female become colorblind?
She would have to inherit two genes for colorblindness, which is very unlikely.
Many sex-linked traits are inherited in a recessive manner.
A person with red-green colorblindness would not be able to see the number
