For example, they have large numbers of offspring.
However, individuals are likely to die young.
Thus, population size is usually well below the carrying capacity.
These species are represented by the lower part of curve A in Figure above . ( r is the population growth rate.
See the "Population Growth" concept.)
Under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially.
The growth rate increases as the population gets larger.
Most populations do not live under ideal conditions and grow logistically instead.
Density-dependent factors slow population growth as population size nears the carrying capacity.
