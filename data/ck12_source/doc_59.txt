In some chordates, all four traits are present in the adult animal and serve important functions.
However, in many chordates, including humans, some traits are present only during the embryonic stage.
After that, these traits may disappear.
All chordates have four main traits ( Figure below ):
Post-anal tail :
The tail is opposite the head and extends past the anus.
Dorsal hollow nerve cord : "Dorsal" means that the nerve cord runs along the top of the animal.
In some animals, the nerve cord develops into the brain and spinal cord.
Notochord:
The notochord lies below the nerve cord.
It is a rigid structure where muscles attach.
Pharyngeal slits :
Pharyngeal slits are used to filter out food from water by some simple chordates.
In most chordates, however, they are only present during the embryonic stages and serve no apparent purpose.
The body plan of a typical chordate
Body Plan of a Typical Chordate.
The body plan of a chordate includes a post-anal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.
Classification of the Chordates
The chordates are divided into nine classes.
Five of the classes are the fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
