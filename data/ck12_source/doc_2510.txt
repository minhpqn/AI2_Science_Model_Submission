All of these forces are thought to be transmitted by bosons, the force-carrying fundamental particles.
The different types of bosons and the forces they carry are shown in Table below .
Consider the examples of gluons, the bosons that carry the strong nuclear force.
A continuous exchange of gluons between quarks binds them together in both protons and neutrons.
Note that force-carrying particles for gravity (gravitons) have not yet been found.
