Human population growth over the past 10,000 years has been tremendous ( Figure below ).
The entire human population was estimated to be:
5 million in 8000 BC
300 million in 1 AD
1 billion in 1802
3 billion in 1961
7 billion in 2011

This shows the exponential increase in human population that has occurred in the last few centuries.

The Rate of Growth
Not only has the population increased, but the rate of population growth has increased ( Figure below ).
The population was estimated to reach 7 billion in 2012, but it did so in 2011.
This was just 12 years after reaching 6 billion.

The amount of time between the addition of each one billion people to the planet’s population, including speculation about the future.
Already, the population reached 7 billion one year earlier than projected.
As the human population continues to grow, different factors limit population in different parts of the world.
Space, clean air, clean water, and food to feed everyone are limiting in some locations.
