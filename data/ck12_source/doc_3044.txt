Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object, whereas buoyant force pushes up on an object.
Which force is greater determines whether an object sinks or floats.
Look at the Figure below .
On the left, the object’s weight is the same as the buoyant force acting on it, so the object floats.
On the right, the object’s weight is greater than the buoyant force acting on it, so the object sinks.

Because of buoyant force, objects seem lighter in water.
You may have noticed this when you went swimming and could easily pick up a friend or sibling under the water.
Some of the person’s weight was countered by the buoyant force of the water.
Density and Buoyant Force
Density, or the amount of mass in a given volume, is also related to the ability of an object to float.
That’s because density affects weight.
A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance.
For example, ice is less dense than liquid water.
This explains why the giant ice berg in the Figure below is floating in the ocean.

Q :
Can you think of more examples of substances that float in a fluid because they are low in density?
A :
Oil is less dense than water, so oil from a spill floats on ocean water.
