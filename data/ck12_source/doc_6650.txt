Highly Social Animals
Some species of animals are very social.
In these species, members of the group depend completely on one another.
Different animals within the group have different jobs.
Therefore, group members must work together for the good of all.
Most species of ants and bees are highly social animals.
Ants live together in large groups called colonies ( Figure below ).
A colony may have millions of ants, making communication among the ants very important.
All of the ants in the colony work together as a single unit.
Each ant has a specific job, and most of the ants are workers.
Their job is to build and repair the colonyâ€™s nest.
Worker ants also leave the nest to find food for themselves and other colony members.
The workers care for the young as well.
Other ants in the colony are soldiers.
They defend the colony against predators.
Each colony also has a queen.
Her only job is to lay eggs.
She may lay millions of eggs each month.
A few ants in the colony are called drones.
They are the only male ants in the colony.
