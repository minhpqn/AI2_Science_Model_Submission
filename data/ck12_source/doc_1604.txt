The phospholipids form a bilayer (two layers).
The middle of the bilayer is an area without water.
There can be water on either side of the bilayer.
There are many proteins throughout the membrane.
The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called cytosol .
Cytosol is composed of water and other molecules, including enzymes , which are proteins that speed up the cellâ€™s chemical reactions.
Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold.
The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell.
The cytoplasm does not include the nucleus.
As a prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm.
The plasma membrane is formed by a phospholipid bilayer.
The plasma membrane controls what moves inside and outside the cell.
The cytosol is the jelly-like material in which the contents of the cell are suspended.
