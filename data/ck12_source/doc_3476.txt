Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst.
A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions.
In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes .
Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.
Like other catalysts, enzymes are not reactants in the reactions they control.
They help the reactants interact but are not used up in the reactions.
Instead, they may be used over and over again.
Unlike other catalysts, enzymes are usually highly specific for particular chemical reactions.
They generally catalyze only one or a few types of reactions.
Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up reactions.
They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second.
As a result, the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous.
A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme, but less than a second with an enzyme.

Importance of Enzymes
Enzymes are involved in most of the biochemical reactions that take place in organisms.
