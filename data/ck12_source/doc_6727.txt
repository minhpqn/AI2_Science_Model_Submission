What net force F_{net} has been applied to the tractor?
What is the normal force, F_N on the tractor?
What is the force of gravity F_g on the tractor?
What force has been applied to the tractor so that it moves uphill?
What is the source of this force?
A heavy box (mass 25 \;\mathrm{kg} ) is dragged along the floor by a kid at a  30^\circ angle to the horizontal with a force of 80 \;\mathrm{N} (which is the maximum force the kid can apply).
Draw the free body diagram.
What is the normal force F_N ?
Does the normal force decrease or increase as the angle of pull increases?
Explain.
Assuming no friction, what is the acceleration of the box?
Assuming it begins at rest, what is its speed after ten seconds?
Is it possible for the kid to lift the box by pulling straight up on the rope?
In the absence of friction, what is the net force in the x- direction if the kid pulls at a 30^\circ angle?
In the absence of friction, what is the net force in the x- direction if the kid pulls at a 45^\circ angle?
In the absence of friction, what is the net force in the x- direction if the kid pulls at a  60^\circ angle?
The kid pulls the box at constant velocity at an angle of 30^\circ .
What is the coefficient of kinetic friction \mu_K between the box and the floor?
The kid pulls the box at an angle of 30^\circ , producing an acceleration of 2 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 .
What is the coefficient of kinetic friction \mu_{K} between the box and the floor?
