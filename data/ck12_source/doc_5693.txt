photoelectric cell:
Use energy of light to generate electricity.
photoelectric effect:
A phenomenon that occurs when light shined onto a metal surface causes the ejection of electrons from that metal.
photon:
A particle of electromagnetic radiation that has zero mass and carries a quantum of energy.
threshold frequency:
Minimum frequency needed to cause electron ejection.
Atomic Emission Spectra
Define ground state.
Define excited state.
Describe how atomic emission spectra are produced.
Shooting an arrow is similar to emitting an electron
How much energy does it take to shoot an arrow?
Archery as a sport or a means of defense has existed for centuries.
At rest, there is no tension on the bowstring and no force on the arrow.
When the string and arrow are pulled back, we now have a situation where kinetic energy (pulling of the string) has been converted to potential energy (the tension on the string).
The archer releases the arrow and the potential energy is translated into kinetic energy as the arrow moves.
It turns out that electrons behave the same way when energy is put into the system or released from the system.
