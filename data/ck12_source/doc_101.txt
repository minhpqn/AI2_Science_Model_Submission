Therefore, the body size of a snake has a major influence on its eating habits.
A snake can usually estimate in advance if a prey is too large.
The snake’s jaw is unique in the animal kingdom.
Snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached.
They also have many other joints in their skull, allowing them to open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole.
Some snakes have a venomous bite, which they use to kill their prey before eating it.
Other snakes kill their prey by strangling them, and still others swallow their prey whole and alive.
After eating, snakes enter a resting stage, while the process of digestion takes place.
The process is highly efficient, with the snake’s digestive enzymes dissolving and absorbing everything but the prey’s hair and claws!
Snakes and lizards are both in the order Squamata, distinguished by horny scales or shields and movable quadrate bones, which make it possible to open the upper jaw very wide.
Snakes are different from legless lizards because they do NOT have eyelids, limbs, external ears, or forelimbs.
