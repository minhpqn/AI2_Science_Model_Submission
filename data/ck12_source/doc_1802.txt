Rocks also weather differently.
Igneous rocks are usually solid and are more resistant to weathering.
Intrusive igneous rocks weather slowly because it is hard for water to penetrate them.
Sedimentary rocks usually weather more easily.
For example, limestone dissolves in weak acids like rainwater.
Different types of sedimentary rocks can weather differently.
This will lead to differential erosion.
In the photo of the Grand Canyon, some layers create cliffs.
These are hard rocks that do not weather easily.
Rock layers that resist weathering and erosion form the top of the canyon and the top of features.
Softer layers form slopes.
These are rocks that weather more easily ( Figure below ).
Weathering in the Grand Canyon, with hard rocks forming cliffs and soft rocks forming slopes
The rocks in this photo of the Grand Canyon are all sedimentary.
Hard rocks that are resistant to weathering form cliffs.
Softer rocks that weather more easily form slopes.
Climate is the temperature plus precipitation of an area.
Not just today, but over a long period of time.
