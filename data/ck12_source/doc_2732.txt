Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms.
This forms a strong, rigid, three-dimensional structure (see Figure below ).
Diamond is the hardest natural substance, and no other natural substance can scratch it.
This property makes diamonds useful for cutting and grinding tools as well as for rings and other jewelry (see Figure below ).

Uses of diamond
Graphite is a form of crystalline carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms.
The carbon atoms are arranged in layers, with strong bonds within each layer but only weak bonds between layers (see Figure below ).
The weak bonds between layers allow the layers to slide over one another, so graphite is relatively soft and slippery.
This makes it useful as a lubricant.
Structure and uses of graphite
Q:
Why do graphite’s properties make it useful for pencil “leads”?
A:
Being slippery, graphite slides easily over paper when you write.
Being soft, it rubs off on the paper, allowing you to leave marks.
Graphite’s softness also allows you to sharpen it easily. (Imagine trying to sharpen a diamond!)
A fullerene (also called a Bucky ball) is a form of carbon in which carbon atoms are arranged in a hollow sphere resembling a soccer ball (see Figure below ).
Each sphere contains 60 carbon atoms, and each carbon atom is bonded to three others by single covalent bonds.
The bonds are relatively weak, so fullerenes can dissolve and form solutions.
