The two ions are attracted to each and join a matrix of interlocking sodium and chloride ions, forming a crystal of salt.
Salt contains sodium and chloride ions
Table salt (sodium chloride).
Q:
Why does sodium give up an electron?
A:
An atom of a group 1 element such as sodium has just one valence electron.
It is “eager” to give up this electron in order to have a full outer energy level, because this will give it the most stable arrangement of electrons.
You can see how this happens in the animation at the following URL and in the Figure below .
Group 2 elements with two valence electrons are almost as reactive as elements in group 1 for the same reason.

Q:
Why does chlorine accept the electron from sodium?
A:
An atom of a group 17 element such as chlorine has seven valence electrons.
It is “eager” to gain an extra electron to fill its outer energy level and gain stability.
Group 16 elements with six valence electrons are almost as reactive for the same reason.
Atoms of group 18 elements have eight valence electrons (or two in the case of helium).
These elements already have a full outer energy level, so they are very stable.
As a result, they rarely if ever react with other elements.
