What do sea otters eat?
Sea otters are known for being playful and frisky.
They are serious eaters, however!
A major part of a sea otter's diet are echinoderms, such as sea urchins.
They manage to eat the soft part of the sea urchins while avoiding the huge sea urchin spines.
Importance of Echinoderms
Echinoderms are important for the ecosystem.
They are also a source of food and medicine for humans.
Echinoderms play numerous ecological roles.
Sand dollars and sea cucumbers burrow into the sand, providing more oxygen at greater depths of the sea floor.
This allows more organisms to live there.
In addition, starfish prevent the growth of algae on coral reefs.
This allows the coral to filter-feed more easily.
And many sea cucumbers provide a habitat for parasites such as crabs, worms, and snails.
Echinoderms are also an important step in the ocean food chain.
Echinoderms are the staple diet of many animals, including the sea otter.
On the other hand, echinoderms eat seaweed and keep its growth in check.
Recall that the sea urchin is a grazer, mainly feeding on algae on the coral and rocks.
Recently, some marine ecosystems have been overrun by seaweed.
Excess seaweed can destroy entire reefs.
