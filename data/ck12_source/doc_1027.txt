Global temperatures are up.
Is one causing the other?
Is the rise in sugar consumption in America causing the average global temperature to rise?
Are rising temperatures causing people to eat more sugar?
Both of these factors are rising, but how are they related?
Are they related by correlation, causation, or both?
We made a few discoveries so far in this concept:
Average global temperature has been rising for the past several decades.
Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been rising for the past several decades.
Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning have been rising for the past several decades.
A correlation is the mutual relationship between two or more things.
We see here a correlation between three things: (1) CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel burning are rising (2) atmospheric CO 2 levels are rising, and (3) average global temperatures are rising.
These three things exhibit positive correlation .
They are all going in the same direction.
If one factor rises while another sinks they have negative correlation .
For example, the amount of forest land is decreasing.
This factor has a negative correlation with global temperature.
But correlation does not necessarily indicate causation.
Causation refers to the factor that is producing the effect.
If I push a toy car, I will cause it to move.
