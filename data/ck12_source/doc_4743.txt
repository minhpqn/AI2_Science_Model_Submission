The production of aerosols due to poor technique such as squirting the last drop out of pipettes, and the spread of contamination due to spills is completely avoidable and especially important if you are handling infectious material or chemicals.
Wear enclosed toe shoes, instead of sandals or flip flops, or thongs ( Figure below ).
Your feet and toes could easily get hurt or broken or if you dropped something.
Do not wear loose, floppy clothes in the lab; they can get caught in or knock over equipment, causing an accident.
If you have long hair, tie it up for the same reasons listed above.
Do not eat or drink in the lab.
Do not use cell phones in the lab, even if you are only sending a text message.
You can easily contaminate your phone with whatever you have been working with.
Consider where your hands have been, and where your face will be the next time you talk on the phone.
Sweep up broken glass immediately and dispose in a designated area or container, or notify your teacher.
Always listen carefully to your teacher’s instructions.
Although they may be comfy and casual, flip-flops and other open-toed shoes are not suitable footwear in the lab.
In the case of an accident, it is important to begin by telling your teacher and to know where to find safety equipment.
Some common safety equipment in a school lab:

Through the first three lessons, we have discussed what science is and how science is done.
Now we need to turn our attention to Biology.
Biology is the study of life.
As the ‘study of life,’ a knowledge of biology is an extremely important aspect of your education.
