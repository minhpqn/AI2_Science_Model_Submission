\Delta H_5=1.87 \text{ J/g}^\circ \text{C} \times 36.04 \text{ g} \times 40^\circ \text{C} \times \frac{1 \text{ kJ}}{1000 \text{ J}}=2.70 \text{ kJ}
\Delta H_{\text{total}}= \Delta H_1+ \Delta H_2+\Delta H_3+ \Delta H_4+ \Delta H_5=113.4 \text{ kJ}
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The total heat absorbed as the ice at -30°C is heated to steam at 140°C is 113.4 kJ.
The largest absorption of heat comes during the vaporization of the liquid water.
Multi-step calculations for changes of state are described.
