What are potential uses of genetic testing?
Biotechnology and Agriculture - Advanced
Describe various applications of biotechnology as related to agriculture.
Why is biotechnology so important in agriculture?
Why would anyone grow plants like this?
Developing better crops is a significant aspect of biotechnology.
But what is meant by "better?" Crops that are resistant to damage from insects or droughts?
Crops that taste better?
Crops that last longer?
Crops that can grow anywhere?
How do you feed over 7,000,000,000 people?
With biotechnology.
Crops developed with biotechnology must have a significant role in the world's future.
And it all starts in the lab.
Applications of DNA Technology:
Agriculture
Biotechnology has many other useful applications besides those that are medically related.
Many of these are in agriculture and food science.
These include the development of transgenic crops - the placement of genes into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait.
Benefits include:
