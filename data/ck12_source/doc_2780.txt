In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent.
Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article.
A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent.
Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent.
Although most solutes can dissolve in water, some solutes are insoluble in water.
Oil is an example.
Did you ever try to mix oil with water?
No matter how well you mix the oil into the water, after the mixture stands for a while, the oil separates from the water and rises to the top.
You can see how oil floats on ocean water in the Figure below .
Oil is insoluble in water
Oil from an oil spill floats on ocean water.
Solutions and States of Matter
Like salt water in the ocean, many solutions are normally in the liquid state.
However, matter in any state can form a solution.
An alloy, which is a mixture of a metal with one or more other substances, is a solid solution at room temperature.
For example, the alloy bronze is a solution of copper and tin.
Matter in the gaseous state can also form solutions.
