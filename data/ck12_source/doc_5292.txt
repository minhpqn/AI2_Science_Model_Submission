Another example is the collagen genes mentioned above.
Many bones develop from a cartilage template.
This cartilage template is made out of many proteins, with type II collagen, the predominant protein in the cartilage.
The gene for this collagen, COL2A1, when mutated, not only affects the skeletal system, but due to its pleiotropic nature, it may also affect a personâ€™s eyes and hearing.
Epistasis is when a gene at one location (locus) alters the phenotypic expression of a gene at another locus.
Epistasis takes place when the action of one gene is modified by one or several other genes.
These genes are sometimes called modifier genes .
The gene whose phenotype is expressed is said to be epistatic , while the phenotype that is altered is said to be hypostatic .
Sometimes hypostatic phenotypes are completely suppressed.
Epistatic genes are not dominant over the genes they alter or suppress.
Dominance refers to an interaction between alleles of the same gene, not different genes.
Examples of epistasis can be seen at both the genomic level and the phenotypic level.
At the genomic level, it is highly possible that under certain conditions one gene could code for a protein that prevents transcription of the other gene.
At the phenotypic level, examples include the gene causing albinism hiding the gene controlling the color of a person's hair.
In another example, a gene coding for a widow's peak would be hidden by a gene causing baldness.
Epistasis is also seen in people with red hair.
These individuals are homozygous for the red hair alleles, masking the expression at the brown/blonde hair loci, resulting in red hair.
At least two genes are involved in hair color.
One hair color phenotype (brown vs. blond) has a dominant brown allele and a recessive blond allele.
