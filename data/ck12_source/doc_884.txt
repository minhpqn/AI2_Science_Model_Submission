Preserving Water Sources
Explain why water is a limited resource.
Explain the Clean Water Act.
Discuss how water pollution can be prevented.
Summarize benefits of wastewater treatment.
Do we have an infinite supply of drinkable water?
No.
In fact, in many parts of the world, finding clean drinkable water is difficult.
This can lead to various serious health issues.
Hundreds of millions of people world-wide are thought to live in areas where obtaining safe water is difficult.
This makes preserving water resources an important global issue.
Preserving Water Sources
It might seem like there is plenty of water on Earth, but that's not really the case.
Water is a limited resource.
That means that it is used faster than it is replaced.
Theoretically, at some point in time, the supply of fresh water could run out.
Though this is unlikely, it is possible.
But it is a significant issue in parts of the world with large populations.
As these populations continue to grow, the supply of water becomes an increasingly important issue.
Even though we have lots of water in our oceans, we cannot use that water whenever we want.
