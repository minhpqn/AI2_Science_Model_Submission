molar mass CaO = 56.08 g/mol
mass CaO = ? g
The volume of SO 2 will be converted to moles, followed by the mole ratio, and finally a conversion of moles of CaO to grams.
\text{L SO}_2 \rightarrow \text{mol SO}_2 \rightarrow \text{mol CaO} \rightarrow \text{g CaO}
Step 2:
Solve.
1.4 \times 10^3 \text{ L SO}_2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mol SO}_2}{22.4 \text{ L SO}_2} \times \frac{2 \text{ mol CaO}}{2 \text{ mol SO}_2} \times \frac{56.08 \text{ g CaO}}{1 \text{ mol CaO}}=3.5 \times 10^3 \text{ g CaO}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The resultant mass could be reported as 3.5 kg, with two significant figures.
Even though the 2:2 mole ratio does not mathematically affect the problem, it is still necessary for unit conversion.
