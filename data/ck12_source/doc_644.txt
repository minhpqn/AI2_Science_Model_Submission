The density of the air is not uniform but decreases with altitude.
Additionally there is no distinct top surface from which height can be measured.
We can, however, calculate the approximate difference in pressure between two altitudes using the equation P=\rho g \Delta h .
The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.013 × 10 5 Pa.
This pressure is often expressed as 101.3 kPa.
Pressure is defined as force per unit area,  P=\frac{F}{A} .
The SI unit for pressure is N/m 2 which has been named pascal (Pa).
It has been determined experimentally that a fluid exerts pressure equally in all directions.
The pressure of a column of fluid is proportional to the density of the fluid and to the height of the column of fluid above the level,  P=\rho gh .
The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.013 × 10 5  Pa, or 101.3 kPa.
The following video explains fluid pressure.
