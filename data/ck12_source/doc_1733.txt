How does the ocean influence the climate of these three cities?
The climate of San Francisco is influenced by the Pacific Ocean.
The cool California current comes from the north.
Upwelling brings cold water from the deep.
So the water offshore is cold.
Virginia Beach is near the Atlantic Ocean.
But its temperatures are more like Wichita than San Francisco.
Why is the climate in Virginia Beach less influenced by the ocean than San Francisco?
Hint :
Think about the direction the winds are going at that latitude.
The weather in San Francisco comes from over the Pacific Ocean.
Much of the weather in Virginia comes from the continent.
Ocean Currents and Climate
Ocean currents carry warm or cold water throughout the worldâ€™s oceans.
They help to even out the temperatures in the oceans.
This also affects the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world.
Currents that are near shore have a direct impact on climate.
They may make the climate much colder or warmer.
Examples of this are pictured below ( Figure below ).
