An overactive thyroid gland will absorb the radioactive material which can then destroy excess thyroid tissue or any cancer of the thyroid.
The material is sometimes used to image cancers in other parts of the body.
Technetium-99m is perhaps the most widely used radioisotope in diagnosis and treatment (the “m” stands for metastable).
This isotope decays to Tc-99 and a gamma emission of low intensity, making the radiation damage fairly negligible.
The half-life is about six hours, so it will remain in the body for some time.
Tc-99m can be used to look at cardiac damage.
The isotope flows in the blood stream; if there is less blood flow in the heart, there will be less isotope concentrated in the heart muscle.
Similar information can be obtained for blood flow in the brain.
Radioisotope scans can be used to detect tumors
Radioisotope scan to detect tumors.
Isotopes can be very useful in scans to locate cancer cells.
This patient has multiple tumors that have spread (metastasized) from the main tumor.
A radioisotope has been attached to antibodies that bind to specific cancer cells.
The very dark spots in the armpits, neck, and groin represent areas where tumor cells exist.
Many other examples could be presented.
There are presently over 25 different isotopes in use for diagnosis and treatment.
A very partial list can be seen in the Table below .
