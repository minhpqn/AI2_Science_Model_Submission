Bacteria can be identified and classified by their shape:
Bacilli are rod-shaped.
Cocci are sphere-shaped.
Spirilli are spiral-shaped.
Drawing of rod, sphere, and spiral shaped bacteria
Bacteria come in many different shapes.
Some of the most common shapes are bacilli (rods), cocci (spheres), and spirilli (spirals).
Bacteria can be identified and classified by their shape.
Similarities to Eukaryotes
Like eukaryotic cells, bacterial cells have:
Cytoplasm, the fluid inside the cell.
A plasma or cell membrane, which acts as a barrier around the cell.
Ribosomes, in which proteins are put together.
DNA.
By contrast though, bacterial DNA is contained in a large, circular strand.
This single chromosome is located in a region of the cell called the nucleoid .
Many bacteria also have additional small rings of DNA known as plasmids .
See bacterial cell pictured below ( Figure below ).
Structure of a bacterial cell
The structure of a bacterial cell is distinctive from a eukaryotic cell because of features such as an outer cell wall, the circular DNA of the nucleoid, and the lack of membrane-bound organelles.
