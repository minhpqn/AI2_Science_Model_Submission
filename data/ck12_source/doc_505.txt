There is no known cure for cerebral palsy.
Epilepsy is a disease that causes seizures.

There is no known cure for the disease, but children with epilepsy may outgrow it by adulthood.
A headache is a very common nervous system problem.
Headaches may be a symptom of serious diseases, but they are more commonly due to muscle tension.
A tension headache occurs when muscles in the shoulders, neck, and head become too tense.
This often happens when people are “stressed out.” Just trying to relax may help relieve this type of headache.
Mild pain relievers such as ibuprofen may also help.
Sometimes, relaxation is the best solution for a tension headache
Sometimes relaxation is the best “medicine” for a tension headache and to help muscles get rid of pain.
A migraine is a more severe type of headache.
It occurs when blood vessels in the head dilate, or expand.
