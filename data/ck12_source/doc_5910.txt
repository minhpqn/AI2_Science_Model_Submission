A higher bond energy means what?
Why is the energy change positive when a bond is broken?
What does a high bond energy mean?
What kind of bonds do more reactive compounds have?
Which will react more readily: a C-H bond or a Cl-Cl bond?
bond energy:
The energy required to break a covalent bond between two atoms.

Scientist with experiment going wrong
What do I do now?
In every scientist’s life comes that moment when you realize that you were wrong.
Sometimes you think about a problem and recognize where you went astray.
Other times you find out when you go into the lab and the experiment doesn’t work (or gets way too exciting).
What has to happen then is a change in direction.
The good scientist sees the problem and comes up with a new answer.
Then that answer has to be tested to see how it works.
Putting atoms together to form compounds can be done on paper or in the lab.  However, when the shape of the molecule made in the lab is different from the shape of the molecule drawn on paper, then we need to rethink our ideas and find better explanations.
In 1956, British scientists R.J.
Gillespie and R.S.
Nyholm recognized that the current model for explaining bond angles did not work well.
