The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents.
An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent.
In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent.
This can cause problems for the individual.
For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease.
Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.
Types of organisms that reproduce asexually include:
Prokaryotic organisms, like bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce through binary fission , where they grow and divide in half ( Figure below ).
First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges.
The cell then divides into two cells as new membranes form to separate the two cells.
After cell division, the two new cells each have one identical chromosome.
This simple process allows bacteria to reproduce very rapidly.
Flatworms, an invertebrate animal species.
Flatworms divide in two, then each half regenerates into a new flatworm identical to the original, a process called fragmentation .
Different types of insects, fish, and lizards.
These organisms can reproduce asexually through a process called parthenogenesis.
Parthenogenesis happens when an unfertilized egg cell grows into a new organism.
The resulting organism has half the amount of genetic material of the parent.
Parthenogenesis is common in honeybees.
