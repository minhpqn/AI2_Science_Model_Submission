Step 3:
Think about your result.
The volume seems correct given the number of moles.
Sample Problem Three:
Converting Volume to Mass
If we know the volume of a gas sample at STP, we can determine how much mass is present.  Assume we have 867 liters of N 2 at STP.  What is the mass of the nitrogen gas?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
867 L N 2
1 mol = 22.4 L
molar mass of N 2 = 28.02 g/mol
mass of N 2
Step 2:
Calculate.
We start by determining the number of moles of gas present.
We know that 22.4 liters of a gas at STP equals one mole, so:
867 \ \text{litres} \times \frac{1 \ \text{mole}}{22.4 \ \text{liters}}=3.87 \ \text{moles}
We also know the molecular weight of N 2 (28.0 grams/mole), so we can then calculate the weight of nitrogen gas in 867 liters:
38.7 \ \text{moles} \times \frac{28 \ \text{grams}}{\text{mole}}=1083.6 \ \text{grams N}_2
Step 3:
