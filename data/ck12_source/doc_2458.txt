They are reversible changes that do not change matterâ€™s chemical makeup or chemical properties.
For example, when fog changes to water vapor, it is still water and can change back to liquid water again.
Processes that Cause Changes of State
Several processes are involved in common changes of state.
They include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and evaporation.
The Figure below shows how matter changes in each of these processes.
Phase transitions between solid, liquid, and gas
Q:
Which two processes result in matter changing to the solid state?
A:
The processes are deposition, in which matter changes from a gas to a solid, and freezing, in which matter changes from a liquid to a solid.
The Role of Energy in Changes of State
Suppose that you leave some squares of chocolate candy in the hot sun.
A couple of hours later, you notice that the chocolate has turned into a puddle like the one pictured in the Figure below .
Chocolate melting from solid to liquid
Q:
What happened to the chocolate?
A:
The chocolate melted.
It changed from a solid to a liquid.
