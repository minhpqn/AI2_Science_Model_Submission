It works together with the nerves and spinal cord to send the signals that make your body move.
Your nervous system lets you do things like run, jump, play sports, and do your homework.
There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy.
One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs.
Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system.
Another way to keep the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods.
The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium, and vitamins B 1 and B 12 are important for a healthy nervous system.
Some foods that are good sources for these minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure below ).
Your brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish.
Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons.
These fats help build new connections between nerves and brain cells.
These fats may improve memory and increase learning and intelligence.
Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids.
This helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems.
And get plenty of rest.
Your brain requires plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory.
A good nightâ€™s sleep will help keep your brain functioning at its best.

These foods are sources of nutrients needed for a healthy nervous system.
