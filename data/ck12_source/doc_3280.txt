What is the refraction of light?
When and why does it occur?
Draw a diagram to show how visible light refracts when it passes from air to diamond.
Describe a lens and what it does.
Compare and contrast concave and convex lenses.
The tiny object on this man’s finger is life-changing for him.
It lets him see clearly without wearing glasses.
You probably recognize the object as a contact lens.
You may even wear contact lenses yourself.
What Is a Lens?
A lens is a transparent object with one or two curved surfaces.
It is typically made of glass (or clear plastic in the case of a contact lens).
A lens refracts, or bends, light and forms an image.
An image is a copy of an objected formed by the refraction (or reflection) of visible light.
The more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts the light that passes through it.
There are two basic types of lenses: concave and convex.
The two types of lenses have different shapes, so they bend light and form images in different ways.
A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle.
You can see the shape of a concave lens in the Figure below .
From the diagram, it’s clear that the lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread apart, as they pass through it.
