d_{\text{downstream}} = (v_{\text{downstream}})(t) = (9.0 \ \text{m/s})(8.4 \ \text{s}) = 76 \ \text{m}
Vectors can be added mathematically using geometry and trigonometry.
Vectors that are perpendicular to each other have no effect on each other.
Vector addition can be accomplished by resolving the vectors to be added into components those vectors, and then completing the addition with the perpendiuclar components.

What are the steps the teacher undertakes in order to calculate the resultant vector in this problem?
How does she find the components of the individual vectors?
How does she use the individual vector’s components to find the components of the resultant vector?
Once the components are determined, how does she find the overall resultant vector?
A hiker walks 11 km due north from camp and then turns and walks 11 km due east.
What is the total distance walked by the hiker?
What is the displacement (on a straight line) of the hiker from the camp?
While flying due east at 33 m/s, an airplane is also being carried due north at 12 m/s by the wind.
What is the plane’s resultant velocity?
Two students push a heavy crate across the floor.  John pushes with a force of 185 N due east and Joan pushes with a force of 165 N at 30° north of east.  What is the resultant force on the crate?
An airplane flying due north at 90. km/h is being blown due west at 50. km/h.  What is the resultant velocity of the plane?
Gravitational Force and Inclined Plane
Resolve the weight of an object sitting on an inclined plane into the normal force and the parallel force.
Calculate the acceleration of an object resting on an inclined plane given the angle of the incline and the weight of the object.
