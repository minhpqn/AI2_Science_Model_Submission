The mole is the SI unit for amount of a substance.  Just like the dozen and the gross, it is a name that stands for a number.
There are therefore 6.02 × 10 23 water molecules in a mole of water molecules.
There also would be 6.02 × 10 23 bananas in a mole of bananas, if such a huge number of bananas ever existed.
Portrait of Amedeo Avogadro
Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro, whose work led to the concept of the mole as a counting unit in chemistry.
The number 6.02 × 10 23 is called Avogadro’s number , the number of representative particles in a mole.
It is an experimentally determined number.
A representative particle is the smallest unit in which a substance naturally exists.
For the majority of elements, the representative particle is the atom.
Iron, carbon, and helium consist of iron atoms, carbon atoms, and helium atoms, respectively.
Seven elements exist in nature as diatomic molecules and they are H 2 , N 2 , O 2 , F 2 , Cl 2 , Br 2 , and I 2 .
The representative particle for these elements is the molecule.
Likewise, all molecular compounds such as H 2 O and CO 2 exist as molecules and so the molecule is their representative particle.  For ionic compounds such as NaCl and Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , the representative particle is the formula unit.
A mole of any substance contains Avogadro’s number (6.02 × 10 23 ) of representative particles.
The animal mole is very different from the unit mole
The animal mole is very different than the counting unit of the mole.
Chemists nonetheless have adopted the mole as their unofficial mascot.
National Mole Day is a celebration of chemistry that occurs on October 23rd (10/23) of each year.
A mole of any substance contains Avogadro’s number (6.02 × 10 23 ) of representative particles.
