Thus this is not a closed system during a collision of two objects.
Thus you cannot use energy conservation immediately before the collision to immediately after the collision.
However, momentum is conserved during the collision.
Thus break the problem into two parts.
For the collision part use momentum conservation.
You can use energy conservation for the other parts, where it is conserved.

You throw a 0.5\;\mathrm{kg} lump of clay with a speed of 5\;\mathrm{m/s} at a 15\;\mathrm{kg} bowling ball hanging from a vertical rope.
The bowling ball swings up to a height of 0.01\;\mathrm{m} compared to its initial height.
Was this an elastic collision?
Justify your answer.
The 20\;\mathrm{g} bullet shown above is traveling to the right with a speed of 20\;\mathrm{m/s} .
A 1.0\;\mathrm{kg} block is hanging from the ceiling from a rope 2.0\;\mathrm{m} in length.
What is the maximum height that the bullet-block system will reach, if the bullet embeds itself in the block?
What is the maximum angle the rope makes with the vertical after the collision?
A new fun foam target on wheels for archery students has been invented.
The arrow of mass, m , and speed, v_0 , goes through the target and emerges at the other end with reduced speed, v_0/2 .
The mass of the target is 7\;\mathrm{m} .
