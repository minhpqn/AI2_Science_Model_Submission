Uranus is faint because it is very far away.
Its distance from the Sun is 2.8 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles).
A photon from the Sun takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus.
Uranus orbits the Sun once about every 84 Earth years.
An Icy Blue-Green Ball
Uranus is a lot like Jupiter and Saturn.
The planet is composed in part of hydrogen and helium.
There is a thick layer of gas on the outside.
Farther on the inside is liquid.
But Uranus has a higher percentage of icy materials than Jupiter and Saturn.
These materials include water, ammonia, and methane.
Uranus is also different because of its blue-green color.
Clouds of methane filter out red light.
This leaves a blue-green color.
The atmosphere of Uranus has bands of clouds.
These clouds are hard to see in normal light.
The result is that the planet looks like a plain blue ball.
Uranus is the least massive outer planet.
Its mass is only about 14 times the mass of Earth.
Like all of the outer planets, Uranus is much less dense than Earth.
