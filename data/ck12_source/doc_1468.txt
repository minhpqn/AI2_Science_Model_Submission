But they are really all interconnected.
Even so, they are all very different.
This ocean is near a shore and is obviously in a cold region.
It appears to be a good habitat for whales!
No matter what, the oceans have a huge influence on the planet, locally and as a whole.
The Oceans’ Influence
Oceans cover more than 70% of Earth's surface.
Oceans hold 97% of the planet's surface water.
It’s no surprise that the oceans have a big influence on the planet.
The oceans affect the atmosphere, climate, and living things.
Oceans and the Atmosphere
Oceans are the major source of water vapor in the atmosphere.
Sunlight heats water near the sea surface ( Figure below ).
As the water warms, some of it evaporates.
The water vapor rises into the air, where it may form clouds and precipitation.
Precipitation provides the freshwater needed by plants and other living things.
Gas exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere
The oceans and atmosphere exchange gases.
Why does water vapor enter the atmosphere from the water?
Ocean water also absorbs gases from the atmosphere.
