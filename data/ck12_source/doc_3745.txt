Explain the meaning of gene expression.
Identify general mechanisms that regulate gene expression.
Describe the roles of regulatory proteins, transcription factors, cis-regulatory elements and enhancers.
Define an initiation complex.
Can your expression change at any moment?
As you know, a person's expression can change moment by moment.
The expression that is demonstrated is usually appropriate for that moment's feelings.
Gene expression is the use of a gene whose product is necessary for that moment.
It may be a moment during development, it may be a moment of increased anxiety, or it may be in response to an environmental change.
Whenever a particular protein is needed, gene expression provides it.
Each of your cells has at least 20,000 genes.
In fact, all of your cells have the same genes.
Do all of your cells make the same proteins?
Obviously not.
If they did, then all your cells would be alike.
Instead, you have cells with different structures and functions.
This is because different cells make different proteins.
They do this by using, or expressing, different genes.
Using a gene to make a protein is called gene expression .
