A chisel is a very useful tool for carving wood, rocks, and other hard substances.
This man is using a chisel to remove large pieces of wood.
A chisel is a type of machine called a wedge.
What Is a Wedge?
A wedge is simple machine that consists of two inclined planes, giving it a thin end and thick end, as you can see in the Figure below .
A wedge is used to cut or split apart objects.
Force is applied to the thick end of the wedge, and the wedge, in turn, applies force to the object along both of its sloping sides.
