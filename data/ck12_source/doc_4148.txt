The biggest problem was the dryness.
Simply absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge.
It kept early plants small and low to the ground.
Water was also needed for sexual reproduction, so sperm could swim to eggs.
In addition, temperatures on land were extreme and always changing.
Sunlight was also strong and dangerous.
It put land organisms at high risk of mutations.
Vascular Plants Evolve
Plants evolved a number of adaptations that helped them cope with these problems on dry land.
One of the earliest and most important was the evolution of vascular tissues.
Vascular tissues form a plant’s “plumbing system.” They carry water and minerals from soil to leaves for photosynthesis.
They also carry food (sugar dissolved in water) from photosynthetic cells to other cells in the plant for growth or storage.
The evolution of vascular tissues revolutionized the plant kingdom.
The tissues allowed plants to grow large and endure periods of drought in harsh land environments.
Early vascular plants probably resembled the fern shown in Figure below .
Ferns are similar to the first vascular plants
Early vascular plants may have looked like this modern fern.
In addition to vascular tissues, these early plants evolved other adaptations to life on land, including lignin, leaves, roots, and a change in their life cycle.
Lignin is a tough carbohydrate molecule that is hydrophobic (“water fearing”).
It adds support to vascular tissues in stems.
