Bt toxin :
Toxin produced from Bacillus thuringiensis, a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium; commonly used as a biological pesticide.
thale cress :
A small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern Africa; a popular model organism in plant biology and genetics.
transgenic crop :
The result of placement of genes into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait.
Biotechnology in agriculture includes the development of transgenic crops - the placement of genes into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait.
Benefits of agriculture biotechnology include improved yield from crops, reduced vulnerability of crops to environmental stresses, increased nutritional qualities of food crops, improved taste, texture or appearance of food, reduced dependence on fertilizers, pesticides and other agrochemicals, and production of vaccines.
