Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life.
Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests.
Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.
The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia.
Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.
Causes of Aging

Generally, it’s because cells stop dividing and die.
There are at least two reasons why cells stop dividing:
Cells are programmed to divide only a set number of times.
Mutations accumulate in DNA, and cells with damaged DNA may not divide.
