Plate tectonics is the key that unlocks many of the mysteries of our amazing planet.
Plate tectonics theory explains why:
Earth's geography has changed over time and continues to change today.
some places are prone to earthquakes while others are not.
certain regions may have deadly, mild, or no volcanic eruptions.
mountain ranges are located where they are.
many ore deposits are located where they are.
living and fossil species of plants and animals are found where they are.
some continental margins have a lot of geological activity, and some have none.
Plate tectonic motions affect Earthâ€™s rock cycle, climate, and the evolution of life.
The theory of plate tectonics brings together continental drift and seafloor spreading.
At a plate boundary, two plates can be moving apart, together or past each other.
Plate tectonics theory explains many things in geology, such as where volcanoes, earthquakes, mountain ranges, ore deposits, and other features are located.
