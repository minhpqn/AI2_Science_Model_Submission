He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the compass needle.
The needle swung back to its original position, pointing north once again.
Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field.
The magnetic field created by the current was strong enough to attract the needle of the nearby compass.
Oersted Learns More
Oersted wanted to learn more about the magnetic field created by a current.
He placed a compass at different locations around a wire with current flowing through it.
You can see what he found in the Figure below .
The lines of magnetic force circle around the wire in a counterclockwise direction.

Direction of magnetic field relative to current
From Magnets to Electricity
Just about a decade after Oersted discovered that electric current can produce a magnetic field, an English scientist named Michael Faraday discovered that the opposite is also true.
A magnetic field can produce an electric current.
This is known as Faraday’s law.
The process by which a magnetic field produces current is called electromagnetic induction.
It occurs when a conductor, such as a wire, crosses lines of force in a magnetic field.
This can happen when a wire is moving relative to a magnet or a magnet is moving relative to a wire.
Electricity can be used to produce a magnetic field.
