That energy is used to make electricity.
Hydroelectric power , or hydropower, harnesses the energy of water moving down a stream.
Hydropower is the most widely used form of renewable energy in the world.
This abundant energy source provides almost one fifth of the world’s electricity.
The energy of waves and tides can also be used to produce water power.
At this time, wave and tidal power are rare.
To harness water power, a stream must be dammed.
Narrow valleys are the best for dams.
While sitting in the reservoir behind the dam, the water has potential energy.
Water is allowed to flow downhill into a large turbine.
While flowing downhill, the water has kinetic energy.
Kinetic energy makes the turbine spin.
The turbine is connected to a generator, which makes electricity.
Hydropower as a Resource
Many of the suitable streams in the United States have been developed for hydroelectric power.
Many streams worldwide also have hydroelectric plants.
Hydropower is a major source of California’s electricity.
It accounts for about 14.5 percent of the total.
Most of California’s nearly 400 hydroelectric power plants are located in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
