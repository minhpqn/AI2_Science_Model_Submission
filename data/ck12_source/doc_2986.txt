In fact, gravity can act over very long distances.
However, the farther two objects are from each other, the weaker is the force of gravity between them.
Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive objects.
You are already very familiar with Earth’s gravity.
It constantly pulls you toward the center of the planet.
It prevents you and everything else on Earth from being flung out into space as the planet spins on its axis.
It also pulls objects that are above the surface—from meteors to skydivers—down to the ground.
Gravity between Earth and the moon and between Earth and artificial satellites keeps all these objects circling around Earth.
Gravity also keeps Earth and the other planets moving around the much more massive sun.
Q :
There is a force of gravity between Earth and you and also between you and all the objects around you.
When you drop a paper clip, why doesn’t it fall toward you instead of toward Earth?
A :
Earth is so much more massive than you that its gravitational pull on the paper clip is immensely greater.
Gravity and Weight
Weight measures the force of gravity pulling downward on an object.
The SI unit for weight, like other forces, is the Newton (N).
On Earth, a mass of 1 kilogram has a weight of about 10 Newtons because of the pull of Earth’s gravity.
On the moon, which has less gravity, the same mass would weigh less.
Weight is measured with a scale, like the spring scale shown in the Figure below .
