passive transport :
Transport of small molecules or ions across the cell membrane without an input of energy by the cell.
The cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing only certain substances to pass through.
Passive transport is a way that small molecules or ions move across the cell membrane without input of energy by the cell.
The three main kinds of passive transport are diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion.
Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration of the molecules to an area with a lower concentration.
What is diffusion?
What is the main difference between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion?
What is a concentration gradient?
What happens at equilibrium?
Osmosis - Advanced
Distinguish between diffusion and osmosis.
Saltwater Fish vs.
Freshwater Fish?
Fish cells, like all cells, have semi-permeable membranes.
Eventually, the concentration of "stuff" on either side of them will even out.
A fish that lives in salt water will have somewhat salty water inside itself.
Put it in the freshwater, and the freshwater will, through osmosis, enter the fish, causing its cells to swell, and the fish will die.
What will happen to a freshwater fish in the ocean?
Imagine you have a cup that has 100ml water, and you add 15g of table sugar (sucrose, C 12 H 22 O 11 ) to the water.
