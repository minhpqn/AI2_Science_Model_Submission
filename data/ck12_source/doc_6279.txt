The dissolving process releases a large amount of heat, which causes the temperature of the solution to rise.
Care must be taken when preparing concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide because of the large amounts of heat released.
Molar heat of solution is defined.
Sample calculations using molar heat of solution are given.
Work on the problems at the link below:
Does NaOH in solution warm or cool the water?
How can you tell whether a material will produce an increase or decrease in heat when dissolved?
The sample problem was done at 20°C.
Would the temperature increase be the same if the sample was run at 72°C?
molar heat of solution (\Delta H_{\text{soln}}) :
The heat absorbed or released when one mole of a substance is dissolved in water.
Heat of Combustion
Define heat of combustion.
Perform calculations involving heat of combustion.
Ethanol changes the heat of combustion of gasoline
What is gasohol?
In efforts to reduce gas consumption from oil, ethanol is often added to regular gasoline.
It has a high octane rating and burns more slowly than regular gas.
This “gasohol” is widely used in many countries.
It produces somewhat lower carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions, but does increase air pollution from other materials.
