The concentration of copper(II) ions in the half-cell solution decreases.
The cathode is the positive electrode.
Ions move through the membrane to maintain electrical neutrality in the cell.
In the cell illustrated above, sulfate ions will move from the copper side to the zinc side to compensate for the decrease in Cu 2+ and the increase in Zn 2+ .
The two half-reactions can again be summed to provide the overall redox reaction occurring in the voltaic cell.
\text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq)+\text{Cu}(s)
