Promotion of 2s electron.
This is followed by hybridization of the three occupied orbitals to form a set of three sp 2 hybrids, leaving the 2p z orbital unhybridized (see  Figure below ).
Boron hybrid sp2 orbitals
Formation of sp 2 orbital.
The geometry of the sp 2 hybrid orbitals is trigonal planar, with the lobes of the orbitals pointing towards the corners of a triangle (see Figure below ).  The angle between any two of the hybrid orbital lobes is 120Â°.  Each can bond with a 2 p orbital from a fluorine atom to form the trigonal planar BF 3 molecule.

The process of sp 2 hybridization is the mixing of an s orbital with a set of two p orbitals (p x and p y ) to form a set of three sp 2 hybrid orbitals.
Each large lobe of the hybrid orbitals points to one corner of a planar triangle.
Other molecules with a trigonal planar electron domain geometry form sp 2 hybrid orbitals.  Ozone (O 3 ) is an example of a molecule whose electron domain geometry is trigonal planar, though the presence of a lone pair on the central oxygen makes the molecular geometry bent.
The hybridization of the central O atom of ozone is sp 2 .
Paired electrons can be hybridized and then participate in covalent bonding.
