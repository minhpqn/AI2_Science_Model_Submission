Note that the period from Earth's origin to the beginning of the Phanerozoic is called the Precambrian.
Life probably began in the oceans.
No one knows exactly how or when.
Life may have originated more than once.
If life began before the Moon formed, that impact would have wiped it out.
Then life would have had to originate again.
Eventually conditions on Earth became less violent.
The planet could support life.
The first organisms were made of only one cell ( Figure below ).
The earliest cells were prokaryotes .
Prokaryotic cells are surrounded by a cell membrane.
They do not have a nucleus.
Their organelles are free in the cell.
The cells get their nutrients directly from the water they live in.
The cells need to use these nutrients to live and grow.
E. coli, a primitive prokaryote that may resemble the earliest cells
E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a primitive prokaryote that may resemble the earliest cells.
The cells also needed to be able to make copies of themselves.
To do this they stored genetic information in nucleic acids .
The two nucleic acids are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).
