Touching a charged object to the earth is called grounding .
When you touch a conductor to the earth, you allow the earth to share the charge.
Since the earth is billions of times bigger than the object, the earth takes nearly all of the charge.
The charged object that was grounded now has zero charge.
Illustration of a charged object being grounded
It is very easy to ground an object.
All that is necessary is to touch a conducting wire to both the object and the earth.
Electrical devices that run the risk of picking up a large static charge are grounded, meaning they are connected to the earth via such a conducting wire.
Virtually all household appliances, especially washers and dryers, are grounded in this way to eliminate static charge.
Similarly, large trucks, especially gasoline tankers, are grounded via a large chain hanging off the back to prevent sparks when fuel is being unloaded.
Spheres, whether hollow or filled, will always have the excess charge on the surface.
In hollow spheres, the only place for an electron to exist is on the surface.
Similarly, in a solid conducting sphere all the excess charge sits on the surface.
This conclusion is a result of Gaussâ€™s Law, which tells us that the symmetry of the sphere and the fact that the electric field within the sphere is 0 forces the charge to the outside.
Capacitors Store Charge
Pieter Van Musschenbroek, a Dutch physician, invented a device in 1746 that could store electric charge.
Though he named the device a Leyden jar, similar devices today are called capacitors.  A typical capacitor consists of a pair of parallel plates of area A separated by a small distance d .
The space between the two plates is most often filled with an insulator and frequently the plates are rolled into the form of a cylinder.
If voltage is applied to a capacitor, it quickly becomes charged.
One of the parallel plates acquires a negative charge and the other an equal amount of positive charge.
