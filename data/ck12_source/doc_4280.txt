Cnidarian Diversity.
Cnidarians show a lot of variability.
Structure and Function of Cnidarians
All cnidarians have something in common.
Itâ€™s a nematocyst, like the one shown in Figure below .
A nematocyst is a long, thin, coiled stinger.
It has a barb that may inject poison.
These tiny poison "darts" are propelled out of special cells.
They are used to attack prey or defend against predators.
Cnidarian nematocyst development
Cnidarian Nematocyst.
A cnidarian nematocyst is like a poison dart.
It is ejected from a specialized cell.
There are two basic body plans in cnidarians.
They are called the polyp and medusa.
Both are shown in Figure below .
The polyp has a tubular body and is usually sessile.
The medusa (plural, medusae ) has a bell-shaped body and is typically motile.
Some cnidarian species alternate between polyp and medusa forms.
Other species exist in just one form or the other.
