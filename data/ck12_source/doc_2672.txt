The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction.
As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants.
This happens because chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products.
Consider the chemical reaction in which water forms from oxygen and hydrogen gases.
The Figure below represents this reaction.
Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen, and then new bonds form in molecules of water.
In both reactants and products there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, but the atoms are combined differently in water.

Types of Chemical Reactions
The chemical reaction in the Figure above , in which water forms from hydrogen and oxygen, is an example of a synthesis reaction.
In this type of reaction, two or more reactants combine to synthesize a single product.
There are several other types of chemical reactions, including decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions.
The Table below compares these four types of chemical reactions.
You can see demonstrations of each type at this URL:
Type of Reaction
A+B → C
2Na + Cl 2 → 2NaCl
AB → A + B
2H 2 O →2H 2 + O 2
