The goal is to pull the other team over a line in the middle.
At first, there is a great deal of tension on the rope, but no apparent movement.
A bystander might think that there is nothing happening.
In reality, there is a great deal of tension on the rope as the two teams pull in opposite directions at the same time.
Hydrogen and iodine gases react to form hydrogen iodide according to the following reaction:
\text{H}_2(g)+\text{I}_2(g) & \rightleftarrows 2\text{HI}(g) \\\text{Forward reaction:} & \quad \text{H}_2(g)+\text{I}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{HI}(g) \\\text{Reverse reaction:} & \quad 2\text{HI}(g) \rightarrow \text{H}_2(g)+\text{I}_2(g)
Initially, only the forward reaction occurs because no HI is present.
As soon as some HI has formed, it begins to decompose back into H 2 and I 2 .
Gradually, the rate of the forward reaction decreases while the rate of the reverse reaction increases.
Eventually the rate of combination of H 2 and I 2 to produce HI becomes equal to the rate of decomposition of HI into H 2 and I 2 .
When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions have become equal to one another, the reaction has achieved a state of balance.
Chemical equilibrium is the state of a system in which the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction.
At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction
Equilibrium in reaction:
H 2 (g) + I 2 (g) â†’ 2HI(g).
Chemical equilibrium can be attained whether the reaction begins with all reactants and no products, all products and no reactants, or some of both.
The Figure below shows changes in concentration of H 2 , I 2 , and HI for two different reactions.
In the reaction depicted by the graph on the left (A), the reaction begins with only H 2 and I 2 present.
There is no HI initially.
As the reaction proceeds towards equilibrium, the concentrations of the H 2 and I 2 gradually decrease, while the concentration of the HI gradually increases.
