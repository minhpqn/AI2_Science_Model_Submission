Covalent compounds consist of atoms that are held together by covalent bonds.
These bonds form between nonmetals that share valence electrons.
Covalent compounds exist as individual molecules.
Water is an example of a covalent compound.
Ionic compounds consist of ions that are held together by ionic bonds.
These bonds form when metals transfer electrons to nonmetals.
Ionic compounds exist as a matrix of many ions, called a crystal.
Sodium chloride (table salt) is an example of an ionic compound.
A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically.
A compound always consists of the same elements in the same ratio.
If the same elements combine in different ratios, they form different compounds.
Types of compounds include covalent and ionic compounds.
They differ in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms or ions together.
