Genes that function in patterning the body, providing the placement of certain body parts during development.
maternal effect :
Occurs when an organism shows the phenotype expected from the genotype of the mother, irrespective of its own genotype; often due to the mother supplying mRNA or proteins to the egg.
pair-rule gene :
A type of gene involved in the development of the segmented embryos of insects.
TATA box :
A cis-regulatory element found in the promoter of most eukaryotic genes; when the appropriate cellular signals are present, RNA polymerase binds to the TATA box, completing the initiation complex.
transcription factor :
A protein involved in regulating gene expression; usually bound to a cis-regulatory element on the DNA; also known as a regulatory protein or a trans-acting factor.
Homeobox genes are involved in the regulation of genes important to development.
They encode transcription factors.
Gap genes control the shape of a developing zygote early in its development.
Gap mutants are missing segments in their embryos.
These genes are highly regulated.
