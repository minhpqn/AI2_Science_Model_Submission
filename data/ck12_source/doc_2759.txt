Proteins are one of four classes of biochemical compounds.
Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.
A protein molecule is made from one or more long chains of amino acids, each linked to its neighbors by covalent bonds.
Multiple chains of a protein are held together by weaker bonds.
Proteins are the most numerous and diverse biochemical compounds.
They have many different functions.
At the following URL, watch the animation of protein folding and read the description.
Then answer the questions below.
Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains fold toward the center of the protein to avoid __________.
Other amino acids pull the protein into its final shape by forming __________ and __________ bonds.
Are these statements true or false?
The process of protein folding proceeds by trial and error.
Protein folding continues until the molecule has the largest possible shape.
Amino acid side chains move through each other as folding takes place.
What are proteins?
Describe the “building blocks” of protein molecules.
What determines the shape of a protein?
How is a protein’s shape related to its function?
List three functions of proteins.
Identify the class of biochemical compounds called lipids.
