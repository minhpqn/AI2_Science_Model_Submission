The spider gets to live in the tree, but the tree is unaffected.
Other commensal relationships exist between cattle egrets and livestock.
Cattle egrets are mostly found in meadows and grasslands are always seen near cattle, horses and other livestock.
These birds feed on the insects that come out of the field due to the movement of the animals.
They even eat ticks, fleas, and other insects off the back of animals.
The relationship between tigers and golden jackals is also commensalism.
The jackal alerts the tiger to a kill and feeds on the remains of the prey left by the tiger.
This is not a mutualistic relationship as the tiger does not provide anything to the jackal.
Parasites may live either inside or on the surface of their host.
An example of a parasite is a hookworm.
Hookworms are roundworms that affect the small intestine and lungs of a host organism.
They live inside of humans and cause them pain.
However, the hookworms must live inside of a host in order to survive.
Parasites may even kill the host they live on, but then they also kill their host organism, so this is rare.
Parasites are found in animals, plants, and fungi.
Hookworms are common in the moist tropic and subtropic regions.
There is very little risk of getting a parasite in industrialized nations.
