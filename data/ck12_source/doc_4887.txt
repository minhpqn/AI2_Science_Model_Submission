The only way to remove the integral proteins from the membrane are with synthetic detergents, nonpolar solvents and denaturing agents that disrupt the hydrophobic interactions of the bilayer.
Integral membrane proteins can be classified according to their relationship with the bilayer:
Transmembrane proteins span the entire plasma membrane.
Their function is mainly to regulate the transport of specific molecules across the membrane.
There are two basic types of transmembrane proteins, alpha-helical and beta-barrels, which are discussed in Organic Compounds:
Proteins (Advanced) .
Integral monotopic proteins are permanently attached to the membrane from only one side.
Examples of integral membrane proteins and their functions are:
glycoprotein (cell-to-cell interactions)
Na+/K+ ATPase (responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Sodium and Potassium ions across the plasma membrane)
glucose permease (the reversible transporter protein of glucose)
ion channels & gates (the flow of ions across the cell membrane)
gap junction proteins (a direct connection between the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules and ions to pass freely between cells)
Bacterial rhodopsins (a protein in archaeans that uses the energy of light to pump protons across the membrane)
Peripheral membrane proteins , also called extrinsic proteins, are only temporarily associated with the membrane.
Most peripheral membrane proteins are hydrophilic so usually they are either attached to integral membrane proteins, or they can directly bound to a polar head group of the bilayer.
This way they can be easily removed, which allows them to be involved in cell signaling.
Peripheral membrane proteins are often associated with ion channels and transmembrane receptors.
Examples of peripheral membrane proteins and their functions are:
spectrin (links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton for determination of cell shape, arrangement of transmembrane proteins, and organization of organelles)
