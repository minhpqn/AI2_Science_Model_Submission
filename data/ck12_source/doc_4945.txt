Facilitated Diffusion - Advanced
Describe facilitated transport mechanisms.
Define ion channels.
Identify the role of ion channels in facilitated diffusion.
Can you help me move?
What is one of the questions no one likes to be asked?
Sometimes the cell needs help moving things as well, or facilitating the diffusion process.
And this would be the job of a special type of protein.
Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes through integral membrane transport proteins.
Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport .
Even though facilitated diffusion involves transport proteins (and is essentially a transport process), it can still be considered passive transport because the solute is moving down the concentration gradient, and no input of energy is required.
Facilitated diffusion utilizes proteins known as uniporters.
A uniporter can be either a channel protein or a carrier protein.
As was mentioned earlier, small nonpolar molecules can easily diffuse across the cell membrane.
However, due to the hydrophobic nature of the phospholipids that make up cell membranes, polar molecules and ions cannot do so.
Instead, they diffuse across the membrane through transport proteins.
A transport protein completely spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane.
Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.
A channel protein , a type of transport protein, acts like a pore in the membrane that lets water molecules or small ions through quickly.
