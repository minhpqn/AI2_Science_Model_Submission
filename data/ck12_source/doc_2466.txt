Describe how vaporization occurs.
Contrast vaporization and evaporation.
Define boiling point, and give the boiling point of water.
Why is steam rising from the spring in this picture?
It’s because the water is boiling hot.
The bubbles in the water show that it is boiling.
The water in the spring is hot enough to boil because it comes from an underground source near hot molten rock.
All Steamed Up
Steam actually consists of tiny droplets of liquid water.
What you can’t see in the picture is the water vapor that is also present in the air above the spring.
Water vapor is water in the gaseous state.
It constantly rises up from the surface of boiling hot water.
Why?
At high temperatures, particles of a liquid gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them, so they change to a gas.
The gas forms bubbles that rise to the surface of the liquid because gas is less dense than liquid.
The bubbling up of the liquid is called boiling.
When the bubbles reach the surface, the gas escapes into the air.
The entire process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas that escapes into the air is called vaporization .
