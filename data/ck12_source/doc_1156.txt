What is feedback?
What is the atmosphere?
What is the lithosphere?
Where is the hydrosphere?
How do Earth's layers interact?
Give an example.
Earth's Inner Layers
Identify Earth's internal layers.
Describe the characteristics of Earth's layers.
Distinguish the lithosphere and from the asthenosphere.
What's below our feet?
What's way below?
If we could cut Earth open, we'd see the following layers from inside to outside: inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust.
Alternatively, you can think of the brittle lithosphere riding on the plastic asthenosphere.
Whew!
Layers by Composition
The layers scientists recognize are pictured below ( Figure below ).
Composition of Earth's layers
A cross section of Earth showing the following layers: (1) crust (2) mantle (3a) outer core (3b) inner core (4) lithosphere (5) asthenosphere (6) outer core (7) inner core.
Core, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition:
