Other types of movements may also affect population size and growth.
For example, many species have some means of dispersal .
This refers to offspring moving away from their parents.
This prevents the offspring from competing with the parents for resources such as light or water.
For example, dandelion seeds have “parachutes.” They allow the wind to carry the seeds far from the parents (see Figure below ).
Dandelion seeds disperse far from the parent plant
Dandelion Seeds.
These dandelion seeds may disperse far from the parent plant.
Why might this be beneficial to both parents and offspring?
Migration is another type of movement that changes population size.
Migration is the regular movement of individuals or populations each year during certain seasons.
The purpose of migration usually is to find food, mates, or other resources.
For example, many northern hemisphere birds migrate thousands of miles south each fall.
They go to areas where the weather is warmer and more resources are available (see Figure below ).
Then they return north in the spring to nest.
Some animals, such as elk, migrate vertically.
They go up the sides of mountains in spring as snow melts.
They go back down the mountain sides in fall as snow returns.
