A large, Y-shaped protein produced by B cells; recognizes and binds to antigens in a humoral immune response; also known as immunoglobulins (Ig).
enzyme :
Chemical, usually a protein, that speeds up chemical reactions in organisms; a biological catalyst.
essential amino acid :
An amino acid that cannot be synthesized by the organism, and therefore must be supplied in the diet.
hemoglobin :
The iron-containing oxygen-transport protein found in red blood cells; allows oxygen to be transported in the blood.
kilodalton : 1,000 daltons; a unit that is used for indicating mass on an atomic or molecular scale; a dalton is defined as one twelfth of the mass carbon-12 atom.
peptide bond :
A covalent chemical bond formed between two molecules; usually occurs between amino acids; forms through the release of a molecule of water.
phenylketonuria (PKU) :
An autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized the inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine.
polypeptide :
A chain of amino acids that alone or with other such chains makes up a protein.
protein :
Organic compound made of amino acids.
structure-function relationship :
Principle that states the function of a biological item (molecule, protein, cell) is determined by its structure.
Proteins are organic compounds that consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and, in some cases, sulfur.
They are made up of repeating units called amino acids.
