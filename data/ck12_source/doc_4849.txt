Identify the scientists that first observed cells.
Describe the first cells identified.
What was needed to discover the cell?
The microscope of course.
Objects that were too small to be seen with the human eye were unknown until the microscope was developed.
Once this instrument was developed, a whole new field of science was initiated.
Discovery of Cells
If you look at living organisms under a microscope you will see they are made up of cells.
The word cell , derived from the Latin word cellula meaning small compartment, was first used by Robert Hooke, a British biologist and early microscopist .
Hooke looked at thin slices of cork under a microscope.
The structure he saw looked like a honeycomb as it was made up of many tiny units.
Hookeâ€™s drawing is shown in Figure below .
In 1665 Hooke published his book Micrographia, in which he wrote:
...
I could exceedingly plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular.... these pores, or cells, ... were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any mention of them before this...
Suber cells and mimosa leaves.
This figure is a drawing of the structure of cork from Micrographia as it appeared under the microscope to Robert Hooke.
During the 1670s, the Dutch tradesman Antony van Leeuwenhoek, shown in Figure below , used microscopes to observe many microbes and body cells.
Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes.
Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day.
