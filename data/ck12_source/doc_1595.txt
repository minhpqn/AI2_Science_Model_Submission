Big organisms, like humans, consist of trillions of cells.
Compare a human to a banana.
On the outside, they look very different, but if you look close enough you’ll see that their cells are actually very similar.
Most cells are so small that you cannot see them without the help of a microscope .
It was not until 1665 that English scientist Robert Hooke invented a basic light microscope and observed cells for the first time, by looking at a piece of cork.
You may use light microscopes in the classroom.
You can use a light microscope to see cells ( Figure below ).
But many structures in the cell are too small to see with a light microscope.
So, what do you do if you want to see the tiny structures inside of cells?

In the 1950s, scientists developed more powerful microscopes.
A light microscope sends a beam of light through a specimen, or the object you are studying.
A more powerful microscope, called an electron microscope , passes a beam of electrons through the specimen.
Sending electrons through a cell allows us to see its smallest parts, even the parts inside the cell ( Figure below ).
Without electron microscopes, we would not know what the inside of a cell looked like.

An electron microscope allows scientists to see much more detail than a light microscope, as with this sample of pollen.
In 1858, after using microscopes much better than Hooke’s first microscope, Rudolf Virchow developed the hypothesis that cells only come from other cells.
For example, bacteria, which are single-celled organisms, divide in half (after they grow some) to make new bacteria.
