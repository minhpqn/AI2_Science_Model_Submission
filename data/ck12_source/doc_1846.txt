Longshore drift continually moves sand along the shore.
Deposition occurs where the water motion slows.
The smallest particles, such as silt and clay, are deposited away from shore.
This is where the water is calmer.
Larger particles are deposited onshore.
This is where waves and other motions are strongest.
In relatively quiet areas along a shore, waves deposit sand.
Sand forms a beach ( Figure below ).

Manhattan Beach in Southern California has a pier coming off of a sandy beach.
Waves also move sand from the beaches on shore to bars of sand offshore as the seasons change.
In the summer, waves have lower energy so they bring sand up onto the beach.
In the winter, higher energy waves bring the sand back offshore.
Examples of features formed by wave-deposited sand
Examples of features formed by wave-deposited sand.
A spit is a ridge of sand that extends away from the shore.
The end of the spit may hook around toward the quieter waters close to shore.
Waves may also deposit sediments to form sandbars and barrier islands .
Pictured below are examples of these landforms ( Figure below ); also, an example of all the different landforms waves create ( Figure above ).
