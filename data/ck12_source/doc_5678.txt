In one step:
(0.7577 \times 34.969)+(0.2423 \times 36.966)=35.45 \ \text{amu}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The calculated average atomic mass is closer to 35 than to 37 because a greater percentage of naturally occurring chlorine atoms have the mass number of 35.
It agrees with the value from the Table above .

The atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element.
Calculations of atomic mass use the percent abundance of each isotope.

What information do you need to calculate atomic mass for an element?
Calculate the atomic mass for carbon using the data provided in Table below .
atomic mass:
The weighted average of the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element.
percent abundance:  To calculate the weighted average, take into account the percent natural abundances of each isotope.
The atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element.
