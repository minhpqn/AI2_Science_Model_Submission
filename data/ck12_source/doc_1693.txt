As the warm air rises, it cools.
This brings about clouds and sometimes light precipitation.
Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area.
After a warm front passes, the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures.
The warm air is also likely to be more humid.
Diagram of a warm front
Warm fronts generally bring cloudy weather.
With an occluded front , a warm air mass becomes trapped between two cold air masses.
The warm air is lifted up above the cold air ( Figure below ).
Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical.

How does an occluded front differ from a warm or cold front?
Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet.
These stalled air masses create a stationary front .
Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days.
Much of the weather occurs at fronts, where air masses meet.
In a warm front, a warm air mass slides over a cold air mass.
In a cold front, a cold air mass slides under a warm air mass.
An occluded front has three air masses: cold, warm, and cold.
