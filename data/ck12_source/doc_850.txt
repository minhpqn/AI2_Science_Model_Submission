How much energy could be gained from the warthog?
If the cheetah is successful in capturing the warthog, it would gain some energy by eating it.
But would the cheetah gain as much energy as the warthog has ever consumed?
No, the warthog has used up some of the energy it has consumed for its own needs.
The cheetah will only gain a fraction of the energy that the warthog has consumed throughout its lifetime.
When an herbivore eats a plant, the energy in the plant tissues is used by the herbivore.
But how much of that energy is transferred to the herbivore?
Remember that plants are producers , bringing the energy into the ecosystem by converting sunlight into glucose.
Does the plant use some of the energy for its own needs?
Recall the energy is the ability to do work, and the plant has plenty or "work" to do.
