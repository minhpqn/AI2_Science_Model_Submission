And it all starts with sunlight.
All living things require an ongoing source of energy to do the work of life.
You often see energy in action on a large scale: a whale breaches, apple blossoms swell and burst, a firefly glows, or an inky cap mushrooms overnight.
However, energy works constantly to maintain life on a very small scale as well.
Inside each cell of every organism, energy assembles chains of information and constructs cellular architecture.
It moves tiny charged particles and giant protein molecules.
Moreover, it builds and powers cell systems for awareness, response, and reproduction.
All life’s work requires energy.
Physics tells us that organized systems, such as living organisms, tend to disorder without a constant input of energy.
You have direct, everyday experience with this law of nature: after a week of living in your room, you must spend energy in order to return it to its previous, ordered state.
Tides and rain erode your sandcastles, so you must work to rebuild them.
And your body, after a long hike or big game, must have more fuel to keep going.
Living things show amazing complexity and intricate beauty, but if their source of energy fails, they suffer injury, illness, and eventually death.
Physics also tells us that, although energy can be captured or transformed, it inevitably degrades, becoming heat, a less useful form of energy.
This is why organisms require a constant input of energy; the work they must do uses up the energy they take in.
Energy, unlike materials, cannot be recycled.
The story of life is a story of energy flow – its capture, transformation, use for work, and loss as heat.
Energy , the ability to do work, can take many forms: heat, nuclear, electrical, magnetic, light, and chemical energy.
Life runs on chemical energy - the energy stored in covalent bonds between atoms in a molecule.
Where do organisms get their chemical energy?
