Atherosclerosis in the arteries of the brain can also lead to a stroke.
A stroke is a loss of brain function due to a blockage of the blood supply to the brain.
Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, having a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking.
The best way to reduce the risk of stroke is to have low blood pressure.
Atherosclerosis is a condition in which the inside of arteries become clogged with plaque, a deposit of fatty material.
