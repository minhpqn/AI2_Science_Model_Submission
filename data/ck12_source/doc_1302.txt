This creates a reverse fault .
A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault.
With a thrust fault the angle of the fault is close to horizontal.
Rocks can slip many miles along thrust faults ( Figure below ).
Picture of a thrust fault
In this thrust fault, the rock on the right is thrust over the rock on the left.
The rock on the right has also started to fold because of this movement.
An animation of a thrust fault is seen here:
A strike-slip fault is a dip-slip fault where the dip of the fault plane is vertical.
Strike-slip faults result from shear stresses.
If you stand with one foot on each side of a strike-slip fault, one side will be moving toward you while the other side moves away from you.
If your right foot moves toward you, the fault is known as a right-lateral strike-slip fault.
If your left foot moves toward you, the fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault ( Figure below ).

San Andreas Fault
The San Andreas Fault in California is a right-lateral strike slip fault ( Figure below ).
It is also a transform fault because the San Andreas is a plate boundary.
Unlike what some people think, California will not fall into the ocean someday.
