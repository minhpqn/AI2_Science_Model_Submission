What do you get when you take energy, nutrients and other resources, biomes and their populations, and all the species and their relationships?
You get ecology.
Understanding ecology is in part understanding the biology of our planet.
And it can easily be argued that this is especially important today.
We literally hold the future of our planet in our hands.
The lessons in the Ecology chapter discuss ecology and all the related aspects that comprise the ecosystem.
Define ecology and ecosystem.
Distinguish between abiotic and biotic factors.
Describe a niche and habitat.
Explain the competitive exclusion principle.
What lives in the forest?
Take a close look at this ecosystem.
Obviously there are deer and many types of plants.
But there are organisms that live there that cannot be seen in the picture.
Many other animals, such as rabbits, mice, and countless insects.
There are also bacteria and fungi.
Add in the nonliving aspects of the area, such as the water, and you have an ecosystem.
Ecology is the study of how living things interact with each other and with their environment.
It is a major branch of biology, but has areas of overlap with geography, geology, climatology, and other sciences.
The study of ecology begins with two fundamental concepts in ecology: the ecosystem and their organisms.
