C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2NAD + + 2P i + 2ADP → 2NADH + 2ATP
Anaerobic and aerobic respiration share the glycolysis pathway.
If oxygen is not present, fermentation may take place, producing lactic acid or ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide.
Products of fermentation still contain chemical energy and are used widely to make foods and fuels.
Pyruvate still contains a great deal of chemical energy.
In fact, two pyruvate molecules contain most of the chemical energy from the original glucose molecule.
If oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for complete breakdown by the Krebs Cycle and electron transport chain.
If oxygen is not present, cells must transform pyruvate to regenerate NAD + in order to continue making ATP.
Keep in mind that glycolysis produces a net total of 2 ATP.
Two different pathways accomplish the regeneration of NAD + with rather famous products: lactic acid (C 3 H 6 O 3 ) and ethyl alcohol (C 2 H 6 O) ( Figure above ).
Making ATP in the absence of oxygen by glycolysis alone is known as fermentation .
Therefore, these two pathways are called lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation .
If you lack interest in organisms, such as yeast and bacteria, which have “stuck with” the anaerobic tradition, the products of these chemical reactions may still intrigue you.
Fermentation makes bread, yogurt, beer, wine, and some new biofuels.
In addition, some of your body’s cells are facultative anaerobes, retaining one of these ancient pathways for short-term, emergency use.
Behind each release of gas is an army of gut bacteria undergoing some crazy biochemistry.
These bacteria break down the remains of digested food through fermentation, creating gas in the process.
