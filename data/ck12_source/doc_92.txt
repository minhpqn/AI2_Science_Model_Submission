Amphibians have long been used in scientific research, especially developmental and physiological processes, largely due to their unique ability to undergo metamorphosis, and in some species, to regenerate limbs.
Amphibians are also used in cloning research.
Cloning involves making identical copies of a parent organism, and the large amphibian egg helps in this process.
They are also used to study embryos because their eggs lack shells, so it is easy to watch their development.
The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis , is a species that is studied to understand aspects of developmental biology.
It is a good model organism because it is easy to raise in a lab and has a large embryo, which is easy to study ( Figure below ).
Many Xenopus genes have been identified and cloned, especially those involved in development.
Developing Xenopus embryos can be easily observed and studied with a basic microscope, though the eggs are large enough to see without a microscope.
Because of their size, the exact developmental stage after fertilization can be easily determined.
This allows proteins that are used at a specific developmental time to be collected and analyzed.
Identification of Xenopus genes and proteins has allowed the identification of corresponding genes and proteins from humans.
Many environmental scientists believe that amphibians, including frogs, indicate when an environment is damaged.
When species of frogs begin to decline, it often indicates that there is a bigger problem within the ecosystem.
This could have dramatic effects on food webs and ecosystems.

Amphibians in Popular Culture
Amphibians can be found in folklore, fairy tales, and popular culture.
Numerous legends have developed over the centuries around the mystical properties of the salamander.
Its name originates from the Persian words for “fire” and “within," so many of these legends are related to fire.
