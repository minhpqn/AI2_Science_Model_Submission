A stream may flow into a river that empties into a lake or the ocean.
Running water is better able to dissolve oxygen and nutrients than standing water.
However, the moving water is a challenge to many living things.
Algae and plants, such as the cattails in Figure above , are the primary producers in running water biomes.
A wetland is an area that is saturated with water or covered by water for at least one season of the year.
The water may be freshwater or salt water.
Wetlands are extremely important biomes for several reasons:
They store excess water from floods.
They slow down runoff and help prevent erosion.
They remove excess nutrients from runoff before it empties into rivers or lakes.
They provide a unique habitat that certain communities of plants need to survive.
They provide a safe, lush habitat for many species of animals, so they have high biodiversity.

Restoring Wetlands
More than 100,000 acres of wetlands are being restored in the Northern California Bay Area, but how exactly do we know what to restore them to?
Historical ecologists are recreating San Francisco Bay wetlands that existed decades ago.
