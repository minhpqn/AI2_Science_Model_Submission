What form of energy does each resource supply?
Choose one of the five renewable energy resources described in this article, and do a Web quest to learn more about it.
Start you search at the URL below.
Based on your research, make a list of main points about the energy source you chose.
Describe energy use in the U.S.
Compare oil use in the U.S. and other top oil-using nations.
This woman in Burkina Faso uses a simple wood fire for cooking.
For many people in the world, wood is their main energy resource.
They burn it to stay warm as well as to cook their food.
Other energy resources, such as oil or gas, are simply not available to them or are far too expensive for most people to use.
However, if you live in the U.S. or another of the richer nations of the world, you probably depend almost totally on these more expensive energy resources, especially oil.
Use of Energy Resources
Look at the circle graph in the Figure below .
It shows that oil is the single most commonly used energy resource in the U.S., followed by natural gas, and then by coal.
All of these energy resources are nonrenewable.
Nonrenewable resources are resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up.
Renewable resources, in contrast, provide only 8 percent of all energy used in the U.S.
Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply.
They include solar energy from sunlight, geothermal energy from under Earthâ€™s surface, wind, biomass (from once-living things or their wastes), and hydropower (from running water).
