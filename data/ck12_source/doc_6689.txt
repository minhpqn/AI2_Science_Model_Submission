Label the drawing with the positions and speeds at that moment.
Sketch a position vs. time graph for both you and your brother, labeling the important points ( i.e., starting point, when you catch him, etc.)

You are standing at the foot of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, which is 52 floors (237 m) high.
You launch a ball straight up in the air from the edge of the foot of the building.
The initial vertical speed is 70 m/s. (For this problem, you may ignore your own height, which is very small compared to the height of the building.)
How high up does the ball go?
How fast is the ball going right before it hits the top of the building?
For how many seconds total is the ball in the air?
Measure how high you can jump vertically on Earth.
Then, figure out how high you would be able to jump on the Moon, where acceleration due to gravity is 1/6^{th} that of Earth.
Assume you launch upwards with the same speed on the Moon as you do on the Earth.
A car is smashed into a wall during Weavervilleâ€™s July 4^{th} Destruction Derby.
The car is going 25 m/s just before it strikes the wall.
It comes to a stop 0.8 seconds later.
What is the average acceleration of the car during the collision?
A helicopter is traveling with a velocity of 12 m/s directly upward.
Directly below the helicopter is a very large and very soft pillow.
As it turns out, this is a good thing, because the helicopter is lifting a large man.
When the man is 20 m above the pillow, he lets go of the rope.
