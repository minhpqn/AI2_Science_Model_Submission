Coolant has a higher boiling point than water and adding it to the water increases the boiling point of the solution.
Plastic and aluminum in a kettle conduct heat differently
This teakettle is made of aluminum except for its handle, which is made of plastic.
Aluminum is a good conductor of heat.
It conducts heat from the flames on the range to the water inside the kettle, so the water heats quickly.
Plastic, on the other hand, is not a good conductor of heat.
It stays cool enough to touch even when the rest of the teakettle becomes very hot.
Copper wires can conduct electricity well
Copper is a good conductor of electricity.
That's why electric wires are often made of copper.
They are covered with a protective coating of plastic, which does not conduct electricity.
Q:
The coolant that is added to a car radiator also has a lower freezing point than water.
Why is this physical property useful?
A:
When coolant is added to water in a car radiator, it lowers the freezing point of the water.
This prevents the water in the radiator from freezing when the temperature drops below 0Â°C, which is the freezing point of pure water.
Q:
Besides being able to conduct electricity, what other physical property of copper makes it well suited for electric wires?
A:
