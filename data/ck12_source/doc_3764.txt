We are not just “dust.” We - and our world - are stardust!
How did this rotating cloud of stardust become our solar system?
About 4.5 billion years ago, a nearby star exploded and sent a shock wave through the dust cloud, increasing its rate of spin.
As a result, most of the mass became concentrated in the middle, forming the sun.
Smaller concentrations of mass rotating around the center formed the planets, including Earth.
You can watch a video showing how Earth formed at this link:
At first, Earth was molten and lacked an atmosphere and oceans.
Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust.
As the planet continued to cool, volcanoes released gases, which eventually formed an atmosphere .
The early atmosphere contained ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide but only a trace of oxygen.
As the atmosphere became denser, clouds formed and rain fell.
Water from rain, and perhaps from comets and asteroids that struck Earth as well, eventually formed the oceans.
The ancient atmosphere and oceans represented by the picture in Figure below would be toxic to today’s life, but they set the stage for life to begin.

Ancient Earth.
This is how ancient Earth may have looked after its atmosphere and oceans formed.
Earth formed about 4.5 to 4.6 billion years ago.
At first, Earth was molten and lacked an atmosphere and oceans.
Gradually, the atmosphere formed, followed by the oceans.
