The gymnosperm life cycle has a dominant sporophyte generation.
Both gametophytes and the next generationâ€™s new sporophytes develop on the sporophyte parent plant.
Figure below is a diagram of a gymnosperm life cycle.
Gymnosperm life cycle
The gymnosperm life cycle follows the general plant life cycle, but with some new adaptations.
Can you identify them?
Cones form on a mature sporophyte plant.
Inside male cones, male spores develop into male gametophytes.
Each male gametophyte consists of several cells enclosed within a grain of pollen .
Inside female cones, female spores develop into female gametophytes.
Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule.
Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from a male to female cone.
If sperm then travel from the pollen to an egg so fertilization can occur, a diploid zygote results.
The zygote develops into an embryo within a seed, which forms from the ovule inside the female cone.
If the seed germinates, it may grow into a mature sporophyte tree, which repeats the cycle.
In gymnosperms, the gametophyte generation takes place in a cone, which forms on the mature sporophyte plant.
Each male gametophyte is just a few cells inside a grain of pollen.
Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule.
Pollination must occur for fertilization to take place.
Zygotes develop into embryos inside seeds, from which the next sporophyte generation grows.
