Water is found on Earth as a gas, liquid and solid.
Water as a gas is mostly in the atmosphere.
Water as a solid is found as ice floating on ponds, as frost on a car, or in glaciers, among other places.
Glaciers move, by definition, although they do it very slowly.
Liquid water moves around the planet through streams, groundwater, lakes, ponds.
Most of Earth's liquid water is in the oceans.
But it doesn't remain stagnant there.
Seawater moves in waves, tides, and currents.
Some ocean water changes state and becomes sea ice.
