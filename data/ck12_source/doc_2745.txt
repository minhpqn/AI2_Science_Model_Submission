Fats can be either liquid, like oil, or solid, like butter, at room temperature depending on their chemical structure.
Saturated fats are straight in structure and tightly packed together to form a solid at room temperature.
Double and triple bonds in unsaturated fats make them easier to break down at lower temperatures.
What Are Unsaturated Hydrocarbons?
Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen.
The carbon atoms in hydrocarbons may share single, double, or triple covalent bonds.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms.
They are classified on the basis of their bonds as alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, or alkynes.
Q:
Why do you suppose hydrocarbons with double or triple bonds are called unsaturated?
A:
A carbon atom always forms four covalent bonds.
Carbon atoms with double or triple bonds are unable to bond with as many hydrogen atoms as they could if they were joined only by single bonds.
This makes them unsaturated with hydrogen atoms.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes .
The name of a specific alkene always ends in â€“ene and has a prefix indicating the number of carbon atoms.
The structural formula in the Figure below represents the smallest alkene, named ethene, which has two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms (C 2 H 4 ).
Ethene is produced by most fruits and vegetables.
It speeds up ripening.
The Figure below show the effects of ethene on bananas.
