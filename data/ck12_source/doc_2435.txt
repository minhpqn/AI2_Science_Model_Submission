Can Chemical Changes Be Reversed?
Because chemical changes produce new substances, they often cannot be undone.
For example, you canâ€™t change ashes from burning logs back into wood.
Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical changes.
For example, to undo tarnish on copper pennies, you can place them in vinegar.
The acid in the vinegar combines with the copper oxide of the tarnish.
This changes the copper oxide back to copper and oxygen, making the pennies reddish brown again.
You can try this at home to see how well it works.
A chemical change occurs whenever matter changes into an entirely different substance with different chemical properties.
