spermatogenesis :
The production of mature sperm cells; results in four haploid gametes.
spermatogonia : (singular, spermatogonium ):
Immature sperm cells that form in the testes; they are diploid.
Meiosis is a step during spermatogenesis and oogenesis.
Spermatogenesis produces four haploid sperm cells, while oogenesis produces one mature ovum.
Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.
What are gametes?
Distinguish between sperm, eggs, and isogametes.
How are sperm and eggs made differently?
Discuss the role of meiosis in gametogenesis.
Compare and contrast spermatogenesis and oogenesis.

Sexual Life Cycles - Advanced
Distinguish between the three types of sexual life cycles.
Young to old.
A life cycle?
Not in the biological sense.
Life cycles refer to the amount of DNA present at a specific stage or time in the life of an organism.
Is there a haploid or diploid amount of DNA?
