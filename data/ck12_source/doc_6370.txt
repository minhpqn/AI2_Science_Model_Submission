How is steel produced?
Iron ore (Fe 2 O 3 ) and coke (an impure form of carbon) are heated together to make iron and carbon dioxide.
The reaction is non-spontaneous at room temperature, but becomes spontaneous at temperature above 842 K.
The iron can then be treated with small amounts of other materials to make a variety of steel products.
Temperature and Free Energy
Consider the reversible reaction in which calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas.
The production of CaO (called quicklime) has been an important reaction for centuries.
\text{CaCO}_3(s) \rightleftarrows \text{CaO}(s) +\text{CO}_2(g)
The  \Delta H^\circ for the reaction is 177.8 kJ/mol, while the \Delta S^\circ is 160.5 J/K • mol.
The reaction is endothermic with an increase in entropy due to the production of a gas.
We can first calculate the \Delta G^\circ at 25°C in order to determine if the reaction is spontaneous at room temperature.
\Delta G^\circ=\Delta H^\circ -T \Delta S^\circ=177.8 \ \text{kJ}/ \text{mol} - 298 \ K (0.1605 \ \text{kJ} / \text{K} \cdot \text{mol})=130.0 \ \text{kJ} / \text{mol}
Since the  \Delta G^\circ is a large positive quantity, the reaction strongly favors the reactants and very little products would be formed.
In order to determine a temperature at which  \Delta G^\circ will become negative, we can first solve the equation for the temperature when  \Delta G^\circ is equal to zero.
0 &=\Delta H^\circ - T \Delta S^\circ \\T &=\frac{\Delta H^\circ}{\Delta S^\circ}=\frac{177.8 \ \text{kJ} / \text{mol}}{0.1605 \ \text{kJ} / \text{K} \cdot \text{mol}}=1108 \text{ K}=835^\circ \text{ C}
So at any temperature higher than 835°C, the value of  \Delta G^\circ will be negative and the decomposition reaction will be spontaneous.
At high temperatures, reactions with positive Delta S can become thermodynamically favorable
This lime kiln in Cornwall was used to produce quicklime (calcium oxide), an important ingredient in mortar and cement.
Recall that the assumption that  \Delta H^\circ and  \Delta S^\circ are independent of temperature means that the temperature at which the sign of  \Delta G^\circ switches from being positive to negative (835°C) is an approximation.
It is also important to point out that one should not assume that absolutely no products are formed below 835°C and that at that temperature decomposition suddenly begins.
