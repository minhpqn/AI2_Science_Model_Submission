Cacti and succulents such as the jade plant avoid water loss by fixing CO 2 only at night.
These plants close their stomata during the day and open them only in the cooler and more humid nighttime hours.
Leaf structure differs slightly from that of C 4 plants, but the fixation pathways are similar.
The family of plants in which this pathway was discovered gives the pathway its name, Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, or CAM ( Figure below ).
All three carbon fixation pathways lead to the Calvin cycle to build sugar.

Examples of C3, C4, and CAM plants
Even chemical reactions adapt to specific environments!
Carbon fixation pathways vary among three groups.
Temperate species (maple tree, left) use the C 3 pathway.
C 4 species (corn, center) concentrate CO 2 in a separate compartment to lessen water loss in hot bright climates.
Desert plants (jade plant, right) fix CO 2 only at night, closing stomata in the daytime to conserve water.
How Does the Calvin Cycle Store Energy in Sugar?
As Melvin Calvin discovered, carbon fixation is the first step of a cycle.
Like an electron transport chain, the Calvin cycle, shown in Figure below , transfers energy in small, controlled steps.
Each step pushes molecules uphill in terms of energy content.
Recall that in the electron transfer chain, excited electrons lose energy to NADPH and ATP.
