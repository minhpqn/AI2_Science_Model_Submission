So there is very little precipitation on the leeward side of a mountain range.
The figure below shows how this happens ( Figure below ).
Diagram of the rain shadow effect
What role do prevailing winds play in a rain shadow?
Where air is denser, the air temperature is higher.
Rainshadow effect occurs on the leeward side of a mountain range.
Maritime air may become stuck on the windward side of a mountain range.
For this reason it is unable to bring cooler air farther inland.
