Describe how temperature affects the direction of an equilibrium reaction.
A mix of carbon dioxide and carbon generates carbon monoxide under high temperatures
We tend to think of carbon monoxide only as a hazardous gas produced from incomplete combustion of carbon products.
However, there is a large market for industrially-manufactured carbon monoxide that is used to synthesize most of the acetic acid produced in the world.
One reaction that leads to CO formation involves its formation by passing air over excess carbon at high temperatures.
The initial product (carbon dioxide) equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon, forming carbon monoxide.
At lower temperatures, CO 2 formation is favored while CO is the predominant product above 800Â°C.
Effect of Temperature
Increasing or decreasing the temperature of a system at equilibrium is also a stress to the system.
The equation for the Haber-Bosch process is written again below, as a thermochemical equation.
\text{N}_2(g)+3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftarrows 2\text{NH}_3(g)+91 \text{ kJ}
The forward reaction is the exothermic direction: the formation of NH 3 releases heat.
The reverse reaction is the endothermic direction: as NH 3 decomposes to N 2 and H 2 , heat is absorbed.
An increase in the temperature of a system favors the direction of the reaction that absorbs heat, the endothermic direction.
Absorption of heat in this case is a relief of the stress provided by the temperature increase.
For the Haber-Bosch process, an increase in temperature favors the reverse reaction.
The concentration of NH 3 in the system decreases, while the concentrations of N 2 and H 2 increase.
A decrease in the temperature of a system favors the direction of the reaction that releases heat, the exothermic direction.
For the Haber-Bosch process, a decrease in temperature favors the forward reaction.
The concentration of NH 3 in the system increases, while the concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease.
