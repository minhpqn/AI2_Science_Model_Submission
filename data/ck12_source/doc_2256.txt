Supergiants and Supernovas
Describe how a star becomes a supergiant.
Explain the importance of supernovas.
What if the sun were larger?
A larger star has a different fate.
It will not just eventually fade away.
A large star will explode.
These explosions are very important for all of us.
We could not exist without them.
To see the results of supernova explosions, you need only look at yourself.
A more massive star ends its life in a more dramatic way.
Very massive stars become red supergiants .
Unlike a red giant, when all the helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues.
Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms up to iron atoms.
Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces.
For this reason, stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements.
When there are no more elements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and collapses.
Betelgeuse ( Figure below ) is a red supergiant.
VY Canis Majoris, the largest known star, is even larger.
It is classified as a red hypergiant.
