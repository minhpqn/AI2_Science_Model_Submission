The glaciers advanced during the Pleistocene ice age.
They have been melting back since then, except for during the Little Ice Age.
However, the rate of melting has increased tremendously in recent decades.
Since the end of the Pleistocene, Earth’s temperature has risen.
The image below shows how it changed over just the last 1500 years ( Figure below ).
The Medieval Warm Period was a time of somewhat higher average temperatures.
The Little Ice Age was a time of somewhat lower average temperatures.
But for each time, the anomaly (the difference from average temperature) was less than 1° C (1.8° F).
Still, the overall trend is slightly upward.
Earth's temperature over time has increased
Earth’s temperature.
Different sets of data all show an increase in temperature since about 1880 (the Industrial Revolution).
Recent Temperature Trends
Since the mid 1800s, Earth has warmed up quickly ( Figure below ).
The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1900.
By the end of 2013, 13 of the 14 hottest years ever have occurred since 2000!
This temperature rise is what is usually meant by global warming .
