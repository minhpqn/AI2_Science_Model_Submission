Stage of the eukaryotic cell cycle when the cell grows, synthesizes DNA, and prepares to divide.
microtubules :
Largest component of the cytoskeleton; hollow protein cylinders made of alpha and beta tubulin; also found in flagella.
mitosis :
The division of the nucleus into two genetically identical nuclei.
zygote :
A fertilized egg; the first cell of a new organism.
The cell cycle is a repeating series of events, characterizing the life of a eukaryotic cell.
The cell cycle has four phases: the first growth phase, the synthesis phase, the second growth phase and the mitotic phase.
The DNA is replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle, providing the genetic material for two identical cells.
The cycle ends with cytokinesis, in which two genetically identical cells result.
Define and describe the cell cycle.
What is interphase?
Summarize each phase of the cell cycle.
What is cellular senescence?
When do normal cells usually lose their ability to divide?
Mitosis - Advanced
Identify and describe the main processes in mitosis.
How do all your cells stay genetically identical?
Mitosis, of course.
