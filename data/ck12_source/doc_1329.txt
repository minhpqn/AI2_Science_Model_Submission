Her warning saved the approximately 100 tourists and civilians who were on that beach.
Earthquakes can cause tsunamis .
These deadly ocean waves may result from any shock to ocean water.
A shock could be a meteorite impact, landslide, or a nuclear explosion.
But most come from large underwater earthquakes.
An underwater earthquake creates a tsunami this way: the movement of the crust displaces water.
The displacement forms a set of waves.
The waves travel at jet speed through the ocean.
Since the waves have low amplitudes and long wavelengths, they are unnoticed in deep water.
As the waves reach shore they compress.
They are also pushed upward by the shore.
For these reasons, tsunamis can grow to enormous wave heights.
Tsunami waves can cause tremendous destruction and loss of life.
Fortunately, few undersea earthquakes generate tsunamis.
The Boxing Day Tsunami, 2004
The Boxing Day Tsunami struck on December 26, 2004.
The tsunami was caused by one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded.
The Indian Ocean Earthquake registered magnitude 9.1.
The quake struck near Sumatra, Indonesia, where the Indian plate is subducting beneath the Burma plate.
It released about 550 million times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
