Explain the functions of roots, stems, and leaves.
How does water move from the roots to the top of these trees?
Redwood trees found in Yosemite National Park in California.
Big?
Of course.
How do these trees grow so tall?
It has a lot to do with a very efficient system to move water, sugars and other nutrients.
But the first plants to have such a "vascular system" were not tall trees, but much smaller plants.
Vascular plants are known as tracheophytes , which literally means “tube plants.” The earliest vascular plants quickly came to dominate terrestrial ecosystems.
Why were they so successful?
It was mainly because of their tube-like vascular tissues.
The vascular tissues for which these plants are named are specialized to transport fluid.
