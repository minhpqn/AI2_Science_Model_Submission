Leaves tip, passes straight through the center of lens and exits without bending.
You have a converging lens of focal length 2 units.
If you place an object 5 units away from the lens, (a) draw a ray diagram of the situation to estimate where the image will be and (b) list the charactatistics of the image.
Finally (c) calculate the position of the image.
A diagram of the situation is shown below.
(a):
To draw the ray diagram, we'll follow the steps laid out above for converging lenses.
First we draw the a ray that travels parallel to the principle axis and refracts through the focus on the other side (the red ray).
Next we draw a ray through the focus on the same side that refracts out parallel (the green ray).
Finally we draw the ray that travels straight through the center of the lens without refracting (the blue ray).
The result is shown below.
(b):
Based on the ray diagram and the initial position of the object, we know that the image is a real, inverted, and smaller than the original object.
(c):
To calculate the exact position of the object, we can use the lens maker's equation.
\frac{1}{f}&=\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}\\\\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}\\\\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{2\;\text{units}} - \frac{1}{5\;\text{units}}\\\\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{3}{10\;\text{units}}\\\d_i&=3.33\;\text{units}\\\
