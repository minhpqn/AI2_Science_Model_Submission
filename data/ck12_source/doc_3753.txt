Sketch how an insect with a mutated hox gene might look.
Explain your sketch.
Molecular Biology focuses on DNA and how proteins are made.
DNA contains the information used to make RNA.
RNA leaves the nucleus and, together with a ribosome, makes proteins.
The genetic code is the universal code that all life uses to turn the language of nucleotides into the language of amino acids.
Mistakes in the DNA or RNA sequence can have dangerous consequences for the organism, though these same "mistakes" are the driving force of evolution.
Regulating the specific timing of genes is an important process for cells in every organism to function properly.
