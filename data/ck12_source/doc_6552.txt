Nomenclature and structure of several alkyl halides
Note that for the structure based on methane, no number needs to be used since there is only one carbon atom.
In the third example, the chloro is listed first alphabetically and the chain is numbered so that the sum of the numbers is as low as possible.
Uses of Alkyl Halides
Alkyl halides are often used as synthetic intermediates in the laboratory.
Although these compounds were once widely used as dry cleaning solvents, coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, and propellants in hairsprays and deodorants, increasing awareness of their toxicity has led to a wide-spread decrease in applications for these materials.
Some specific compounds are still used.
Halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) is still used in some situations as an inhalation anesthetic.
The compound DDT is a very effective pesticide, but is only used when nothing else works because of its harmful effects on the environment.
The structure and naming of alkyl halides is described.
