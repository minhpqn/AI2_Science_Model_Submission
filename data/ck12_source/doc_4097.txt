Discuss the significance of the fossil record as evidence for evolution.
What's on this rock?
This rock contains a portion of a fossilized tree fern.
Scientists study fossils of plants, animals, and other organisms in order to better understand what life was like on Earth many years ago and how it has changed over time.
Fossils are important evidence for the theory of evolution.
The Fossil Record
Fossils are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other organisms from the distant past.
Examples of fossils include bones, teeth, and impressions.
By studying fossils, evidence for evolution is revealed.
Paleontologists are scientists who study fossils to learn about life in the past.
Fossils allow these scientists to determine the features of extinct species.
Paleontologists compare the features of species from different periods in history.
