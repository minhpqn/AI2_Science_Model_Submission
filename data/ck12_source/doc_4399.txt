Name and describe flightless birds.
Compare and contrast nocturnal and diurnal raptors.
Give examples of landfowl and waterfowl.
Give an overview of the evolution of birds.
Explain the importance of Deinonychus .
Discuss the hypotheses of the evolution of flight.
Did birds really evolve from dinosaurs?
One is an ostrich, the other is a mononykus dinosaur.
The structural relationship is obvious.
Mononykus moved about on two legs, was very nimble, and could run at high speeds, something that would have been useful in the open desert plains where they lived.
It had a small skull, and its teeth were small and pointed, suggesting that it ate insects and small animals, such as lizards and mammals.
Evolution of Birds
Birds are thought to have evolved from a group of bipedal dinosaurs called theropods .
The ancestor of birds was probably similar to the theropod called Deinonychus, which is represented by the sketch in Figure below .
Fossils of Deinonychus were first identified in the 1960s.
This was an extremely important discovery.
It finally convinced most scientists that birds had descended from dinosaurs, which had been debated for almost a century.
