Gregor Mendel:
Teacher and Scientist
"My scientific studies have afforded me great gratification; and I am convinced that it will not be long before the whole world acknowledges the results of my work." Quote attributed to Gregor Mendel.
For thousands of years, humans have understood that characteristics such as eye color, hair color, or even flower color are passed from one generation to the next.
The passing of characteristics from parent to offspring is called heredity .
Humans have long been interested in understanding heredity.
Many hereditary mechanisms were developed by scholars but were not properly tested or quantified.
The scientific study of genetics did not begin until the late 19 th century.
In experiments with garden peas, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel described the basic patterns of inheritance.
Keep in mind that while we know about DNA and its role as the genetic material, Mendel did not know of the existence of DNA.
Nor did he understand the concept of the chromosome or the process of meiosis, and yet, he was still able to correctly describe basic inheritance patterns.

Gregor Johann Mendel was an Augustinian monk, a teacher, and a scientist ( Figure below ).
He is often called the "father of modern genetics" for his study of the inheritance of traits in pea plants.
Mendel showed that the inheritance of traits follows particular laws, which were later named after him.
The significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20 th century.
The rediscovery of his work led the foundation for the era of modern genetics , the branch of biology that focuses on heredity in organisms.
Gregor Johann Mendel “The Father of Modern Genetics.” 1822-1884.
Johann Mendel was born in 1822 and grew up on his parents’ farm in an area of Austria that is now in the Czech Republic.
