The rate of evolution depends on how many of an organism’s genes have changed over a period of time.
Evolution is usually so gradual that we do not see the change for many, many generations.
Not all organisms evolve at the same rate.
Humans took millions of years to evolve from a mammal that is now extinct.
It is very difficult to observe evolution in humans.
However, there are organisms that are evolving so fast that you can observe evolution!
A human takes about 22 years to go through one generation.
But some bacteria go through over a thousand generations in less than two months.
Some bacteria go through many generations in a few days.
And sometimes a bacterial generation is as fast as 20 minutes!
We can actually trace their evolution as it is happening.
If evolution can take a very long time, how can we visualize how it happens?
Charles Darwin came up with the idea of an evolutionary tree to represent the relationships between different species and their common ancestors ( Figure below ).
The base of the tree represents the ancient ancestors of all life.
The separation into large branches shows where these original species evolved into new species.
The branches keep splitting into smaller and smaller branches as species continue to evolve into more and more species.
Some species are represented by short twigs spurting out of the tree, then stopping.
These are species that went extinct before evolving into new species.
Other “Trees of Life” have been created by other scientists ( Figure below ).
