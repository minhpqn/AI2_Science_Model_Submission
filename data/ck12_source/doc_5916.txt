Lone pair electrons in SF 4 .
The sulfur atom has five electron groups around it, which corresponds to the trigonal bipyramidal domain geometry, as in PCl 5 (see Figure below ).  Recall that the trigonal bipyramidal geometry has three equatorial atoms and two axial atoms attached to the central atom.
Because of the greater repulsion of a lone pair, it is one of the equatorial atoms that are replaced by a lone pair.  The geometry of the molecule is called a distorted tetrahedron or seesaw.
