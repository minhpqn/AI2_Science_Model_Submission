FADH 2 :
Flavin adenine dinucleotide; an energy carrier molecule produced during the Krebs cycle of aerobic cellular respiration.
glycolysis :
The process of “splitting glucose”; stage 1 of aerobic cellular respiration and also the basis of anaerobic respiration; splits glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules, producing 2 (net) ATP.
Krebs cycle :
Stage 2 of aerobic cellular respiration; a series of chemical reactions which completes the breakdown of glucose begun in stage 1, releasing more chemical energy and producing carbon dioxide; also called the Citric Acid Cycle.
multicellularity :
Refers to organisms that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to single-cell organisms; this is characteristic of most eukaryotes.
ozone layer :
A layer in Earth's atmosphere containing relatively high concentrations of ozone; absorbs a high percentage of the Sun's medium-frequency ultraviolet light.
pyruvate :
The 3-carbon product of glycolysis; also known as pyruvic acid.
Theory of Endosymbiosis :
Theory that proposes that eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria, evolved from ancient, free-living prokaryotes that invaded other prokaryotic cells.
Oxygen produced by the first photosynthetic organisms was probably toxic to early anaerobic life forms, but later organisms evolved a way to harness the power of oxygen to make ATP.
In eukaryotic cells, if oxygen is present, the pyruvate molecules produced by glycolysis in the cytoplasm enter the mitochondria for further breakdown and energy release.
The Krebs Cycle harnesses the energy which remains in pyruvate after glycolysis.
The Krebs Cycle removes energy from citric acid in small steps, storing it in diverse energy carrier molecules:
ATP, NADH and FADH
The Krebs Cycle produces two molecules of CO 2 per Acetyl-CoA, completing the breakdown of glucose.
