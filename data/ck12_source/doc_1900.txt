The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through.
The fault cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also the intrusion (D).
So the fault must be the youngest feature.
The intrusion (D) cuts through the three sedimentary rock layers, so it must be younger than those layers.
By the law of superposition, C is the oldest sedimentary rock, B is younger and A is still younger.
The full sequence of events is:
Layer C formed.
Layer B formed.
Layer A formed.
After layers A-B-C were present, intrusion D cut across all three.
Fault E formed, shifting rocks A through C and intrusion D.
Weathering and erosion created a layer of soil on top of layer A.
The oldest rock units lie beneath the younger ones.
By the principle of cross-cutting relationships (and common sense), we know that something must exist before something else can cut across it.
The history of a section of rocks can be deciphered using the principles outlined in this concept.

Look at that geologic cross section.
Do you think it's possible to determine the geological processes that led to the creation of those rocks in those locations in those orders?
