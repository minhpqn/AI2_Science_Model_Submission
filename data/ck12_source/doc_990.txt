A black hole is a region of space from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping.
white dwarf:
A star, approximately the size of the earth, that has undergone gravitational collapse and is in the final stage of evolution for low-mass stars, beginning hot and white and ending cold and dark (black dwarf).
black dwarf:
See definition for white dwarf.
The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
Describe the stars present in each of the significant areas on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.
The constellation Orion
The star constellation “Orion, The Hunter”.
Orion is one of the most beautiful of all constellations, and one of the easiest to find.
It looks like a large (slightly twisted) rectangle high in winter's south-southeastern sky.
Two of the brightest stars in the evening sky lie at opposite corners of the rectangle: bright orange-red Betelgeuse at the northeastern corner (upper left in the photo) and even brighter Rigel at the southwest (lower right in the photo).
Betelgeuse is at least 300 times the Sun's diameter, and perhaps much more.
It puts out about 100,000 times more energy than the Sun does.
When Betelgeuse dies, it will create a fireball that will briefly outshine billions of normal stars.
Betelgeuse is a red giant and Rigel is a blue giant.
The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (often referred to as the H-R diagram) is a scatter graph that shows various classes of stars in the context of properties such as their luminosity , absolute magnitude, color, and effective temperature.
Created around 1910 by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell, the diagram provided a great help in understanding stellar evolution.
There are several forms of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the nomenclature is not very well defined.
The original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis.
