They may form over continents or oceans.
Air masses are moist if they form over oceans.
They are dry if they form over continents.
Air masses that form over oceans are called maritime air masses.
Those that form over continents are called continental air masses.
The image below shows air masses that form over or near North America ( Figure below ).

North American air masses.
An air mass takes on the conditions of the area where it forms.
For example, a continental polar air mass has cold dry air.
A maritime polar air mass has cold moist air.
Which air masses have warm moist air?
Where do they form?
Movement of Air Masses
When a new air mass moves over a region it brings its characteristics to the region.
This may change the area's temperature and humidity.
Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions.
For example, a warm air mass moving over cold ground may cause an inversion.
Why do air masses move?
Winds and jet streams push them along.
