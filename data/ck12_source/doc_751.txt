What is the power delivered to a light bulb when the circuit has a voltage drop of 120 V and produces a current of 3.0 ampere?
Solution:
P = VI = (120 \ \text{J/C})(3.0 \ \text{C/s}) = 360 \ \text{J/s} = 360 \ \text{watts}
Example Problem:
A 6.00 V battery delivers a 0.400 A current to an electric motor that is connected across the battery terminals.
What power is consumed by the motor?
How much electric energy is delivered in 500. seconds?
P = VI = (6.00 \ \text{V})(0.400 \ \text{A}) = 2.4 \ \text{watts}
\text{Joules} = (\text{J/s})(\text{s}) = (2.4 \ \text{J/s})(500. \ \text{s}) = 1200 \ \text{Joules}
Electric current is the flow of electrons from the high potential energy position to the lower potential energy position.
Current flow is the direction a positive current would be traveling, or the opposite direction that electrons actually flow.
A closed loop containing current flow is called an electric circuit.
Electric current is measured in coulombs per second, or amperes.
Electric energy is measured in joules per second, or watts.
The energy carried by an electric current depends on the charge transferred and the potential difference across which it moves, E = qV .
Power, P = VI = \left(\frac{\text{Joules}}{\text{coulomb}}\right)\left(\frac{\text{coulomb}}{\text{second}}\right) = \frac{\text{Joules}}{\text{second}} = \text{watts}.
