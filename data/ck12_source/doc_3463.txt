Cells can then use the components to build new proteins.
Humans are able to synthesize all but eight of the twenty common amino acids.
These eight amino acids, called essential amino acids , must be consumed in foods.
Like dietary carbohydrates and lipids, dietary proteins can also be broken down to provide cells with energy.
Proteins are organic compounds made up of amino acids.
A protein may have up to four levels of structure.
The complex structures of different proteins give them unique properties.
Enzymes are proteins that speed up biochemical reactions in cells.
Antibodies are proteins that target pathogens for destruction.
