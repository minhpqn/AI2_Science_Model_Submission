You may get sick if you breathe in the pathogens.
Thousands of tiny infectious droplets are released in a sneeze
As this picture shows, thousands of tiny droplets are released into the air when a person sneezes.
Each droplet may carry thousands of pathogens.
You can’t normally see the droplets from a sneeze because they are so small.
However, you can breathe them in, along with any pathogens they carry.
This is how many diseases of the respiratory system are spread.
Pathogens on Surfaces
Other pathogens spread when they get on objects or surfaces.
A fungus may spread in this way.
For example, you can pick up the fungus that causes athlete’s foot by wearing shoes that an infected person has worn.
You can also pick up this fungus from the floor of a public shower or other damp areas.
After acne, athlete’s foot is the most common skin disease in the United States.
Therefore, the chance of coming in contact with the fungus in one of these ways is fairly high.
Bacteria that cause the skin disease impetigo, which causes blisters, can spread when people share towels or clothes.
The bacteria can also spread through direct skin contact in sports like wrestling.
Pathogens and Vectors
Still other pathogens are spread by vectors .
A vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another.
Most vectors are insects, such as ticks and mosquitoes.
