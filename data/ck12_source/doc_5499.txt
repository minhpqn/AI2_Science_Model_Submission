Transgenic animals are animals that have incorporated a gene from another species into their genome.
They are used as experimental models to perform phenotypic tests with genes whose function is unknown, or to generate animals that are susceptible to certain compounds or stresses for testing purposes.
Other applications include the production of human hormones, such as insulin.
Animal cloning is the generation of genetically identical animals using DNA from a donor animal, not a gamete.
Dolly, a sheep, was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell.
