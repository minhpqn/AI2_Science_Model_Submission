Some reactions occur readily at room temperature because the reacting particles already have the requisite activation energy at that temperature.
Other reactions only occur when heated because the particles do not have enough energy unless an external source of heat provides the particles with more kinetic energy.
Activation energy is defined for a chemical reaction.
