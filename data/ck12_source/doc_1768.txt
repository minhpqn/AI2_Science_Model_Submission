Warming will affect the entire globe by the end of this century.
The map in the Figure below shows how much temperatures will change in different regions based on the Coupled Climate 2.1 model.
In what place is the temperature increase the greatest?
Where in the United States is the temperature increase the highest?
Map of estimated change in temperatures by 2050
The Arctic will experience the greatest temperature changes.
What Will Happen
As temperature rises, more sea ice will melt.
The figure below shows how much less sea ice there may be in 2050 if temperatures keep going up ( Figure below ).
This would cause sea level to rise even higher.
Some coastal cities could be under water.
Millions of people would have to move inland.
How might other living things be affected?
Estimated Arctic sea ice coverage in 2050
In the 2050s, there may be only half as much sea ice as there was in the 1950s.
Weather will become more extreme.
Heat waves and droughts will become more frequent and more intense.
The Midwestern United States will become hot and dry.
This will make growing food more difficult.
Cropland worldwide will be affected.
