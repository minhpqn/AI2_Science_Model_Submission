Energy flows through the ecosystems.
The connections between organisms are made in a web.
This is known as the food web.
There are many types of ecosystems in fresh water, the oceans, and on land.
Organisms must be well adapted to their habitats or they may go extinct.
Extinction of a species opens up a niche.
A new and possibly different species will evolve to fill that niche.
This has occurred throughout Earth's history.
Mass extinctions have opened habitats.
New organisms have evolved to fill those habitats.
The earliest life was simple cells.
Photosynthesis evolved and provided a food source for the food web.
Photosynthesis also supplied oxygen to the atmosphere.
Multicellular life didn't evolve for 4 billion years.
During most of the Paleozoic, life was restricted to the seas.
Reptiles, especially dinosaurs, ruled in the Mesozoic.
Even in the Cenozoic life was fairly different from what we see today.
Humans and apes had a single ancestor.
The evolution of humans is better understood as more fossils are discovered.
