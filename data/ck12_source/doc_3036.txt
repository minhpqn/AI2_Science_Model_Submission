Invisible particles of gases in the air are constantly moving and bumping into them.
Pressure of Gas Particles
Because gas particles in the air—like particles of all fluids—are constantly moving and bumping into things, they exert pressure .
The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earth’s surface and decreases as you go higher above the surface.
You can see this in the Figure below .
Chart of atmospheric pressure in relation to altitude
Q :
Denver, Colorado, is called the “mile-high city” because it is located 1 mile (1.6 km) above sea level.
What is the average atmospheric pressure that high above sea level?
A :
From the Figure above , the average atmospheric pressure 1.6 km above sea level is about 85 kPa.
Explaining Changes in Air Pressure with Altitude
There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases: density and depth of the atmosphere.
Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity, so gas particles are denser near the surface.
With more gas particles in a given volume, there are more collisions of particles and therefore greater pressure.
The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes.
With greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down from above.
Therefore, air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude.
On top of Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level.
