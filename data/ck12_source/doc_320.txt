But how does your heart get blood to and from every cell in your body?
Your heart is connected to blood vessels such as veins and arteries.
Organs that work together form an organ system .
Together, your heart, blood, and blood vessels form your cardiovascular system .
What other organ systems can you think of?
Organ Systems Work Together
Your bodyâ€™s 12 organ systems are shown below ( Table below ).
Your organ systems do not work alone in your body.
They must all be able to work together.
For example, one of the most important functions of organ systems is to provide cells with oxygen and nutrients and to remove toxic waste products such as carbon dioxide.
A number of organ systems, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, all work together to do this.
