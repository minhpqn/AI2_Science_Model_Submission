The Periodic Table
Early History of the Periodic Table
Describe Dobereiner’s triad approach to organizing elements.
Describe Newland’s Law of Octaves.
Sorting books are like sorting elements
When you go to the library to find a book, how do you locate it?
If it is a fiction book, you look by author since the fiction materials are filed by the author’s last name.
If you are looking for a non-fiction publication, you look in a catalog (most likely on a computer these days).
The book you are looking for will have a number by the title.
This number refers to the Dewey Decimal system, developed by Melvil Dewey in 1876 and used in over 200,000 libraries throughout the world.
Another system in wide use is the Library of Congress approach, developed in the late 1800s-early 1900s to organize the materials in the federal Library of Congress.
This method is one of the most widely used ways to organize libraries in the world.
Both approaches organize information so that people can easily find what they are looking for.
Chemistry information also needs to be organized so we can see patterns of properties in elements.
Early Attempts to Organize Elements
By the year 1700, only a handful of elements had been identified and isolated.
Several of these, such as copper and lead, had been known since ancient times.
As scientific methods improved, the rate of discovery dramatically increased.
With the ever-increasing number of elements, chemists recognized that there may be some kind of systematic way to organize the elements.
The question was: how?
