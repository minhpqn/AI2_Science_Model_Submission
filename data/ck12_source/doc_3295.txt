A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge.
In the Figure below , you can see that positively charged protons (+) are located in the nucleus of the atom, while negatively charged electrons (-) move around the nucleus.
Location of charges in an atom
When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract, so positive and negative particles attract each other.
You can see this in the Figure below .
This attraction explains why negative electrons keep moving around the positive nucleus of the atom.
Like charges, on the other hand, repel each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart.
This is also shown in the diagram.
The attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force .
The strength of electric force depends on the amount of electric charge on the particles and the distance between them.
Larger charges or shorter distances result in greater force.
You can experiment with electric force with the animation at the following URL.
Like charges repel each other
Q:
How do positive protons stay close together inside the nucleus of the atom if like charges repel each other?
A:
Other, stronger forces in the nucleus hold the protons together.
Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching.
Particles that have opposite charges attract each other.
Particles that have like charges repel each other.
