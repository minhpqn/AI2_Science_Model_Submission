One must be careful not to confuse the term spontaneous with the notion that a reaction occurs rapidly.
A spontaneous reaction is one in which product formation is favored, even if the reaction is extremely slow.
A piece of paper will not suddenly burst into flames, although its combustion is a spontaneous reaction.
What is missing is the required activation energy to get the reaction started.
If the paper were to be heated to a high enough temperature, it would begin to burn, at which point the reaction would proceed spontaneously until completion.
In a reversible reaction, one reaction direction may be favored over the other.
Carbonic acid is present in carbonated beverages.
It decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide and water according to the following reaction.
If you were to start with pure carbonic acid in water and allow the system to come to equilibrium, more than 99% of the carbonic acid would be converted into carbon dioxide and water.
The forward reaction is spontaneous because the products of the forward reaction are favored at equilibrium.
In the reverse reaction, carbon dioxide and water are the reactants and carbonic acid is the product.
When carbon dioxide is bubbled into water, less than 1% is converted to carbonic acid when the reaction reaches equilibrium.
The reverse reaction, as written above, is not spontaneous.
Spontaneous and nonspontaneous reactions are defined.
Examples of both types of reactions are given.
