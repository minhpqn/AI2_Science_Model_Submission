Two positive or two negative charges repel each other, and two opposite charges attract each other.
The attraction of opposite electric charges explains how ionic bonds form.
How Ionic Bonds Form
An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions.
It forms when atoms of a metallic element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element.
The Figure below shows how this happens.
How ionic bonds form
In row 1 of the Figure above , an atom of sodium (Na) donates an electron to an atom of chlorine (Cl).
By losing an electron, the sodium atom becomes a sodium ion.
It now has more protons than electrons and a charge of +1.
Positive ions such as sodium are given the same name as the element.
The chemical symbol has a plus sign to distinguish the ion from an atom of the element.
The symbol for a sodium ion is Na + .
By gaining an electron, the chlorine atom becomes a chloride ion.
It now has more electrons than protons and a charge of -1.
Negative ions are named by adding the suffix â€“ ide to the first part of the element name.
The symbol for chloride is Cl - .
Sodium and chloride ions have equal but opposite charges.
Opposite electric charges attract each other, so sodium and chloride ions cling together in a strong ionic bond.
You can see this in row 2 of the Figure above . (Brackets separate the ions in the diagram to show that the ions in the compound do not actually share electrons.) When ionic bonds hold ions together, they form an ionic compound.
