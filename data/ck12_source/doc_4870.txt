The bacterium in Figure above is a prokaryote.
Prokaryotes are microscopic organisms that have neither a membrane-bound nucleus nor membrane-bound organelles.
Some cell biologists consider the term "organelle" to describe membrane-bound structures only, whereas other cell biologists define organelles as discrete structures that have a specialized function.
Prokaryotes have ribosomes, which are not surrounded by a membrane but do have a specialized function, and could therefore be considered organelles.
All metabolic functions carried out by a prokaryote take place in the plasma membrane or the cytosol.
Prokaryotes are the smallest types of cells, averaging 2-5Î¼m in diameter.
Despite their small size, inside each cell there is chemical and biochemical machinery necessary for growth, reproduction, and the acquisition and utilization of energy.
The common features of prokaryotic cells are:
capsule (most, but not all)
flagella (most, but not all)
pili (most, but not all)
lack of compartmentalization
plasmid (most, but not all)
All prokaryotes have a cell wall that adds structural support, acts as a barrier against outside forces and anchors the whip-like flagella .
Some prokaryotes have an extra layer outside their cell wall called a capsule, which protects the cell when it is engulfed by other organisms, assists in retaining moisture, and helps the cell adhere to surfaces and nutrients.
Pili are hair-like structures on the surface of the cell that attach to other bacterial cells or surfaces.
Within the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm is not subdivided by membranes into organelles, a lack of compartmentalization that is most evident in the organization of the genetic material.
Prokaryotic cells contain only a single circular piece of chromosomal DNA stored in an area called the nucleoid .
Some prokaryotes also carry smaller circles of DNA called plasmids .
Plasmids are physically separate from, and can replicate independently of, the chromosomal DNA.
