These protons then flow down their concentration gradient, moving back into the thylakoid by facilitated diffusion.
During this process, ATP is made by adding inorganic phosphate to ADP.  Most of the ATP produced during cellular respiration is made during this stage.
For each glucose that starts cellular respiration, in the presence of oxygen (aerobic conditions), 36-38 ATP are generated.
Without oxygen, under anaerobic conditions, much less (only two!) ATP are produced.
Most of the steps of cellular respiration take place in the mitochondria.
Oxygen and glucose are both reactants in the process of cellular respiration.
The main product of cellular respiration is ATP; waste products include carbon dioxide and water.
