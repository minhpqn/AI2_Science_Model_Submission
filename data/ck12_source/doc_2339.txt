For the first time in history, people did not have to rely on human or animal muscle, wind, or water for power.
With the steam engine to power machines, new factories sprang up all over Britain.
Model of Watt's steam engine
This is a museum model similar to the steam engine invented by James Watt.
The Industrial Revolution began in Britain the late 1700s.
It eventually spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and many other countries.
It marked a major turning point in human history.
Almost every aspect of daily life was influenced by it in some way.
Average income and population both began to grow faster than ever before.
People flocked to the new factories for jobs, and densely populated towns and cities grew up around the factories.
The new towns and cities were crowded, and soot from the factories polluted the air.
You can see an example of this in the Figure below .
This made living conditions very poor.
Working conditions in the factories were also bad, with long hours and the pace set by machines.
Even young children worked in the factories, damaging their health and giving them little opportunity for education or play.
Polluting smokestacks in Manchester
Dozens of factory smokestacks polluted the air in the English city of Manchester in the 1800s.
Q:
In addition to factory machines, the steam engine was used to power farm machinery, trains, and ships.
What effects might this have had on peopleâ€™s lives?
