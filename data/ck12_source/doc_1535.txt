There are very few gas molecules in the mesosphere.
This means that there is little matter to absorb the Sun’s rays and heat the air.
Most of the heat that enters the mesosphere comes from the stratosphere below.
That’s why the mesosphere is warmest at the bottom.
Meteors in the Mesosphere
Did you ever see a meteor shower ( Figure below )?
Meteors burn as they fall through the mesosphere.
The space rocks experience friction with the gas molecules.
The friction makes the meteors get very hot.
Many meteors burn up completely in the mesosphere.

Red Sprites and Blue Jets
Red sprites and blue jets are electrical discharges ( Figure below ).
They are not the same thing as lightning.
They more closely resemble the discharges seen in fluorescent tubes.
These events occur much higher up in the atmosphere than lightning.
Altitude of blue jets and red sprites
Red sprites occur higher in the atmosphere than blue jets, while both occur higher than lightning.
