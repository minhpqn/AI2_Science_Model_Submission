Use the ideal gas law to calculate parameters for ideal gases.
The ideal gas law can be used to determine the amount of gas present in a system
What chemical reactions require ammonia?
There are a number of chemical reactions that require ammonia.
In order to carry out the reaction efficiently, we need to know how much ammonia we have for stoichiometric purposes.
Using gas laws, we can determine the number of moles present in the tank if we know the volume, temperature, and pressure of the system.
Ideal Gas Law
The combined gas law shows that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to volume and directly proportional to temperature.
Avogadroâ€™s law shows that volume or pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas.
Putting these together leaves us with the following equation:
\frac{P_1 \times V_1}{T_1 \times n_1}=\frac{P_2 \times V_2}{T_2 \times n_2}
As with the other gas laws, we can also say that \frac{\left(P \times V \right)}{\left(T \times n \right)} is equal to a constant.
The constant can be evaluated provided that the gas being described is considered to be ideal.
The ideal gas law is a single equation which relates the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of an ideal gas.
If we substitute in the variable  R for the constant, the equation becomes:
\frac{P \times V}{T \times n}=R
The ideal gas law is conventionally rearranged to look this way, with the multiplication signs omitted:
The variable  R in the equation is called the ideal gas constant .
Evaluating the Ideal Gas Constant
The value of R , the ideal gas constant, depends on the units chosen for pressure, temperature, and volume in the ideal gas equation.
