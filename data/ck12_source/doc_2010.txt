There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ).
The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico.
The rivers drain vast agricultural lands.
The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.
Pond covered with algae, and a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico due to too much nitrogen
The pond on the left is covered with algae because there is too much nitrogen in the water.
The red-shaded area in the map on the right is a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.
It’s called the hypoxic (“low oxygen”) zone in the figure.
This very thorough video on the nitrogen cycle with an aquatic perspective was created by high school students:

Nitrogen is an essential part of many molecules needed by living organisms.
Nitrogen is fixed when it is changed into a form that organisms can use.
Dead zones come about when excess nitrogen in the water causes algae to grow out of control.
Decomposers use oxygen to decompose the algae when they die.
The lack of oxygen makes it impossible for other organisms to live in that zone.
