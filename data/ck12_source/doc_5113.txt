The bacteria then use that gene to make a protein.
The protein can be separated from the bacteria and then used to treat patients.

Bacteria are important in practically all ecosystems because many bacteria are decomposers .
They break down dead materials and waste products and recycle nutrients back into the environment.
The recycling of nutrients, such as nitrogen, by bacteria, is essential for living organisms.
Organisms cannot produce nutrients, so they must come from other sources.
We get nutrients from the food we eat; plants get them from the soil.
How do these nutrients get into the soil?
One way is from the actions of decomposers.
Without decomposers, we would eventually run out of the materials we need to survive.
We also depend on bacteria to decompose our wastes in sewage treatment plants.
Bacteria can be used to make foods and medicines.
