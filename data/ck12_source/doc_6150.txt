The next major constituent is oxygen (about 21%), followed by the inert gas argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.03%) and trace amounts of neon, methane, helium, and other gases.
Solid-solid solutions such as brass, bronze, and sterling silver are called alloys.
Bronze (composed mainly of copper with added tin) was widely used in making weapons in times past dating back to at least 2400 B.C.
This metal alloy was hard and tough, but was eventually replaced by iron.
Perhaps the most familiar liquid-solid solution is dental amalgam, used to fill teeth when there is a cavity.
Approximately 50% of the amalgam material is liquid mercury to which a powdered alloy of silver, tin and copper is added.
Mercury is used because it binds well with the solid metal alloy.
However, the use of mercury-based dental amalgam has gone under question in recent years because of concerns regarding the toxicity of mercury.
Solutions may be composed of a variety of solid, liquid, or gaseous materials.
Read the material and answer questions 1-3 on the following website:

Is there an example of a solution where water is the solute?
When we mix ethylene glycol with the water in our car radiator to prevent freezing, which is the solvent and which is the solute?
Rate of Dissolving
List and describe factors that affect the rate of dissolving.
Many factors, include stirring, affect the rate at which a material dissolves
How sweet do you like your tea?
Many people enjoy a cold glass of iced tea on a hot summer day.
Some like it unsweetened, while others like to put sugar in it.
How fast the sugar dissolved depends on several factors: how much sugar was put in the tea and how cold it is?
