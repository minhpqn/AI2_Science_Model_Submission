We can calculate exactly how much effort force is required to lift the resistance in this system:
\text{Output Work} = \text{Input Work}
(\text{Resistance Force})(\text{Resistance Arm}) = (\text{Effort Force})(\text{Effort Arm})
(500. \ \text{N})(0.400 \ \text{m}) = (x)(0.800 \ \text{m})
x = 250. \ \text{N}
In this case, since the effort arm is twice as long as the resistance arm, the effort force required is only half the resistance force.
This machine allows us to lift objects using only half the force required to lift the object directly against the pull of gravity.
The distance the effort force is moved is twice as far as the resistance will move.
Thus, the input work and the output work are equal.
(a) How much force is required to lift a 500. kg stone using an ideal lever whose resistance arm is 10.0 cm and whose effort arm is 2.00 m?
(b) What is the IMA?
(c) If the actual effort force required to lift the stone was 305 N, what was the AMA?
(a) (\text{resistance force})(\text{resistance arm}) = (\text{effort force})(\text{effort arm})
\text{effort force}=\frac{(\text{resistance force})(\text{resistance arm})}{(\text{effort arm})}=\frac{(4900 \ \text{N})(0.100 \ \text{m})}{(2.00 \ \text{m})}=245 \ \text{N}
(b) \text{IMA}=\frac{\text{effort arm}}{\text{resistance arm}}=\frac{2.00 \ \text{m}}{0.100 \ \text{m}}=20
(c) \text{AMA}=\frac{\text{resistance force}}{\text{effort force}}=\frac{4900 \ \text{N}}{305 \ \text{N}}=16
A  pulley  is a wheel on an axle that is designed to rotate with movement of a cable along a groove at its circumference.
Pulleys are used in a variety of ways to lift loads, apply forces, and to transmit power, but the simplest of pulleys serves only to reverse the direction of the effort force.
It consists of a single pulley attached directly to a non-moving surface with a rope or cable through it.
As a downward force is applied to one side of the pulley, the other side of the pulley, with the attached resistance force, is pulled upward.
