It might only take one sperm to fertilize an egg, but that sperm is not alone.
Hundreds of millions of sperm can be released during sexual intercourse.
Sperm and Sperm Production
Sperm ( Figure below ), the male reproductive cells, are tiny.
In fact, they are the smallest cells in the human body.

How do you think the shape of the sperm might help it swim?
A sperm has three main parts:
The head of the sperm contains the nucleus.
The nucleus holds the DNA of the cell.
The head also contains enzymes that help the sperm break through the cell membrane of an egg.
The midpiece of the sperm is packed with mitochondria.
Mitochondria are organelles in cells that produce energy.
Sperm use the energy in the midpiece to move.
The tail of the sperm moves like a propeller, around and around.
