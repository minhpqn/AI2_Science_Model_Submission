Once it was cooler, water vapor could condense.
It changed back to its liquid form.
Liquid water could fall to Earthâ€™s surface as rain.
Over millions of years water collected to form the oceans.
Water began to cycle on Earth as water evaporated from the oceans and returned again as rainfall.
Streams carry dissolved minerals.
These ions make the oceans salty.
Marine sedimentary rocks are found that are four billion years old.
The first oceans could have formed as early as 4.2 to 4.4 billion years ago!
The Later Atmosphere
Eventually plants evolved.
Plants produce oxygen as a product of photosynthesis.
Oxygen spread around the planet about 2.5 billion years ago.
Many organisms died off because they could not handle the oxygen.
But this development was extremely important for other life.
Animals need oxygen to breathe.
If photosynthesis had not evolved there would be no animals.
Oxygen is needed to make ozone.
Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen ions.
Ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks harmful solar radiation from reaching the surface.
