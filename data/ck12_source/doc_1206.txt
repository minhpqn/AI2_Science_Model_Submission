Geological processes have brought some igneous rocks to the surface.
Pictured below is a landscape in California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains made of granite that has been raised to create mountains ( Figure below ).
The Sierra Nevada Mountains are made of intrusive igneous rock
California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains are intrusive igneous rock exposed at Earth’s surface.
Extrusive Igneous Rocks
Extrusive igneous rocks form above the surface.
The lava cools quickly as it pours out onto the surface ( Figure below ).
Extrusive igneous rocks cool much more rapidly than intrusive rocks.
The rapid cooling time does not allow time for large crystals to form.
So igneous extrusive rocks have smaller crystals than igneous intrusive rocks.
Extrusive igneous rocks are also called volcanic rocks .
Lava cools to form extrusive igneous rock, and rhyolite formations in Chiricahua National Monument
(A) Lava cools to form extrusive igneous rock.
The rocks here are basalts. (B) The strange rock formations of Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona are formed of the extrusive igneous rock rhyolite.
Some extrusive igneous rocks cool so rapidly that crystals do not develop at all.
These form a glass, such as obsidian.
Others, such as pumice, contain holes where gas bubbles were trapped in the lava.
The holes make pumice so light that it actually floats in water.
The most common extrusive igneous rock is basalt.
It is the rock that makes up the ocean floor.
