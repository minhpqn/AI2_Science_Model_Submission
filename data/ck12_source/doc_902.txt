Describe slash-and-burn agriculture.
Human Causes of Extinction
Describe the effects of global warming on habitats.
Summarize associations between pollution and species extinction.
Discuss issues associated with human overpopulation.
Why are these polar bears threatened?
These polar bears are threatened because of global warming.
They depend on the sea ice for their hunting grounds, and this ice is melting away.
Plus bears have to make a longer and more hazardous journey to get to the remaining ice.
Other Causes of Extinction
In addition to habitat destruction, other human-caused problems are also threatening many species.
These include issues associated with climate change, pollution, and over-population.
Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change.
During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F).
You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous.
Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth.
Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate.
Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species.
Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive.
For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.
