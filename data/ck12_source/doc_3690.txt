The mutation can be passed from one generation to the next.
Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in one or a few genes.
Other genetic disorders are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes.
Genetic Disorders Caused by Mutations
The Table below lists several genetic disorders caused by mutations in just one gene.
Some of the disorders are caused by mutations in autosomal genes, others by mutations in X-linked genes.
Which disorder would you expect to be more common in males than females?

Direct Effect of Mutation
Signs and Symptoms of the Disorder
Mode of Inheritance
defective protein in connective tissue
heart and bone defects and unusually long, slender limbs and fingers
Sickle cell anemia
abnormal hemoglobin protein in red blood cells
sickle-shaped red blood cells that clog tiny blood vessels, causing pain and damaging organs and joints
Vitamin D-resistant rickets
lack of a substance needed for bones to absorb minerals
soft bones that easily become deformed, leading to bowed legs and other skeletal deformities
