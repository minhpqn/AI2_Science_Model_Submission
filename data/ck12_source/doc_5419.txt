repressor :
A protein that binds to non-coding sequences on the DNA (operator) that are close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand.
specificity factor :
Protein that alters the specificity of RNA polymerase for a promoter or set of promoters, making it more or less likely to bind to the promoter and begin transcription.
TATA box :
A cis-regulatory element found in the promoter of most eukaryotic genes; when the appropriate cellular signals are present, RNA polymerase binds to the TATA box, completing the initiation complex.
trans-acting factor :
A protein involved in regulating gene expression that binds to a cis-regulatory element.
transcription factor :
A protein involved in regulating gene expression; usually bound to a cis-regulatory element on the DNA; also known as a regulatory protein or a trans-acting factor.
A cis-regulatory element is a region of DNA which regulates the expression of a gene or multiple genes located on that same strand of DNA.
The cis-regulatory elements are often binding sites for one or more trans-acting factors, usually a regulatory protein which interacts with RNA polymerase.
Repressor proteins bind to non-coding sequences on the DNA that are close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand.
Enhancers are sites on the DNA strand that are bound by activators.
Common cis-regulatory elements include the TATA box, Pribnow box and CCAAT box.
