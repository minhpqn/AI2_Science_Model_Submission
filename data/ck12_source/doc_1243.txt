What is uniformatarianism?
What did Wegener write about in his book?
What did Wegener think caused continental drift?
Give specific examples of the response to Wegener's continental drift hypothesis.
What did scientists learn after the war?
Describe the continental drift hypothesis.
Why did scientists reject Wegenerâ€™s idea?
What was needed for them to accept it?
What was Wegener's mechanism for drifting continents?
Magnetic Polarity Evidence for Continental Drift
Summarize magnetic polarity.
Identify how magnetic polarity evidence supports continental drift.
How did technology play a role in developing Wegener's idea?
After Wegener's death, the continental drift idea was pretty much dead.
It would have remained that way except for the development of technology.
Using technology, scientists would find more evidence that continents had drifted.
They would also be able to find the mechanism.
