The equilibrium or rest position of the medium in a wave.
crest:
A crest is the point on a wave with the maximum value or upward displacement within a cycle
trough:
A trough is the opposite of a crest, so the minimum or lowest point in a cycle
amplitude:
The maximum displacement from a zero value during one period of an oscillation.
wavelength:
The distance between corresponding points of two consecutive waves.
frequency:
The number of waves that pass a fixed point in unit time.
period:
A period is the time required for one complete cycle of vibration to pass a given point.
Describe longitudinal waves.
A slinky is an example of a longitudinal wave
Playing with a Slinky is a childhood tradition, but few children realize they are actually playing with physics.
Like transverse waves, longitudinal waves  are mechanical waves, which means they transfer energy through a medium.
Unlike transverse waves, longitudinal waves cause the particles of medium to move parallel to the direction of the wave.
They are most common in springs, where they are caused by the pushing an pulling of the spring.
Although the surface waves on water are transverse waves, fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) usually transmit longitudinal waves.
