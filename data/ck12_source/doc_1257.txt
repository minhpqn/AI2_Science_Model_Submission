They were eroded at their tops.
As the seafloor moved away from the ridge, the crust sank deeper.
The tops of the guyots went below sea level.
The Mechanism for Continental Drift
Seafloor spreading is the mechanism that Wegener was looking for!
Convection currents within the mantle drive the continents.
The continents are pushed by oceanic crust, like they are on a conveyor belt.
Over millions of years the continents move around the planet’s surface.
The spreading plate takes along any continent that rides on it.
Seafloor spreading is a mixture different ideas and data.
Continental drift and mantle convection are supported by bathymetric and magnetic data from the seafloor.
Harry Hess called his idea “an essay in geopoetry." This could be because so many ideas fit together so well.
It could also be because, at the time, he didn’t have all the seafloor data he needed for evidence.
Seafloor spreading is the mechanism for the drifting continents.
