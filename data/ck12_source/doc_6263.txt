Specifically, the combustion of 1 mol of methane releases 890.4 kilojoules of heat energy.
This information can be shown as part of the balanced equation.
\text{CH}_4(g)+2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+890.4 \ \text{kJ}
The equation tells us that 1 mol of methane combines with 2 mol of oxygen to produce 1 mol of carbon dioxide and 2 mol of water.
In the process, 890.4 kJ is released and so it is written as a product of the reaction.
A thermochemical equation is a chemical equation that includes the enthalpy change of the reaction.
The process in the above thermochemical equation can be shown visually in the Figure below .
In endothermic reactions, enthalpy increases and heat is absorbed from the environment
(A) As reactants are converted to products in an exothermic reaction, enthalpy is released into the surroundings.
The enthalpy change of the reaction is negative. (B) As reactants are converted to products in an endothermic reaction, enthalpy is absorbed from the surroundings.
The enthalpy change of the reaction is positive.
In the combustion of methane example, the enthalpy change is negative because heat is being released by the system.
Therefore, the overall enthalpy of the system decreases.
The heat of reaction is the enthalpy change for a chemical reaction.
In the case above, the heat of reaction is âˆ’890.4 kJ.
The thermochemical reaction can also be written in this way:
\text{CH}_4(g)+2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \quad \Delta H=-890.4 \ \text{kJ}
Heats of reaction are typically measured in kilojoules.
It is important to include the physical states of the reactants and products in a thermochemical equation as the value of the  \Delta H depends on those states.
Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings as the reaction occurs.
