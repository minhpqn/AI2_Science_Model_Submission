Compare the top and bottom arrows.
They point in different directions, but they are the same size.
This shows that the reaction forces are equal and opposite to the action forces.
These skaters are demonstrating Newton's third law of motion
Equal and Opposite but Not Balanced
Because action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, you might think they would cancel out, as balanced forces do.
But you would be wrong.
Balanced forces are equal and opposite forces that act on the same object.
That’s why they cancel out.
Action-reaction forces are equal and opposite forces that act on different objects, so they don’t cancel out.
In fact, they often result in motion.
Think about Jerod again.
He applies force with his foot to the ground, whereas the ground applies force to Jerod and the skateboard, causing them to move forward.
Q :
Actions and reactions occur all the time.
Can you think of an example in your daily life?
A :
Here’s one example.
If you lean on something like a wall or your locker, you are applying force to it.
The wall or locker applies an equal and opposite force to you.
