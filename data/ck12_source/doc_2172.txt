Inner versus Outer Planets
Compare and contrast the inner and outer planets.
What's better than a field trip?
All of the inner planets are orbited by man-made satellites.
Jupiter and Saturn have man-made satellites too.
We can see what the planets look like from the photos they take.
The satellites also carry instruments that collect a lot of important data.
This is better than taking a field trip to such hostile places.
You can learn a lot while sitting your own, very comfortable planet!
