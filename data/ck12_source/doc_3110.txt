Give three examples of stored chemical energy.
What happens to the energy when an explosive goes off?
Why is food considered stored chemical energy?
How is the energy in coal harnessed?
Who invented dynamite?
How was the nitroglycerin made more stable?
What kind of energy is released when we burn natural gas?
How does burning gasoline power a car?
How do batteries create energy?
Explain how a hand-warmer works.
energy:  The ability to perform work.
chemical reaction:
Chemical reactions either require energy or release energy.
The amount of energy needed or released depends upon the structure of the molecules that are involved in the reaction.
Define kinetic energy.
