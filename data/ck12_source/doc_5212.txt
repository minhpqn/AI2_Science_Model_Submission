Once again Mendel began with a true-breeding P generation, but this time true-breeding for two characteristics.
For example, he crossed pea plants that had yellow and round seeds with a plant that had green and wrinkled seeds.
From Mendel's first experiments, yellow seed color is dominant to green seed color, and round seed shape is dominant to wrinkled.
So for the F 1 generation, as before, the recessive traits disappeared, leaving Mendel with pea plants that had only round and yellow seeds.
He then allowed the F 1 generation to self-pollinate, and examined the resulting F 2 generation.
In the F 2 generation, the recessive traits reappeared, as did two novel combinations of traits: round green seeds, and wrinkled yellow seeds.
From these results, Mendel concluded that characteristics were inherited independently of each other.
That is the only way that the two new combinations of traits could have developed.
From these findings, Mendel developed his second law, the Law of Independent Assortment.
This chart represents Mendel's second set of experiments.
It shows the outcome of a cross between plants that differ in seed color (yellow or green) and seed form (shown here with a smooth round appearance or wrinkled appearance).
The letters R, r, Y, and y represent genes for the characteristics Mendel was studying.
Mendel didnâ€™t know about genes, however.
Genes would not be discovered until several decades later.
This experiment demonstrates that in the F2 generation, 9/16 were round yellow seeds, 3/16 were wrinkled yellow seeds, 3/16 were round green seeds, and 1/16 were wrinkled green seeds.
