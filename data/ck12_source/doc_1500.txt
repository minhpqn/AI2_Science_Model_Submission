The oil may coat and kill ocean animals.
Some of the oil will wash ashore.
This oil may destroy coastal wetlands and ruin beaches.
The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill
The figure below shows workers trying to clean up oil on a Louisiana beach ( Figure below ).
The oil washed ashore after a deadly oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
Oil on beaches after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill
After an oil rig explosion, hundreds of miles of beaches looked like this one.
Cleaning them up was a huge task.
New drilling techniques allow oil companies to drill in deeper waters than ever before.
In April 2010 a rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded.
Eleven workers were killed and 17 injured.
When the drill rig sank, a pipe was disconnected and oil gushed into the Gulf.
Three months later the well was capped.
But 4.9 million barrels had entered the Gulf, about 16 times more oil than the largest oil spill to date.
Once the oil is in the water, there are three ways to try to clean it:
Removal:
Corral and then burn the oil.
Containment:
Use containment booms to trap the oil.
