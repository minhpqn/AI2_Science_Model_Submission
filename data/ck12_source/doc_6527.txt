The radiolabel is C-11 (half-life is 20.38 minutes).
Structure of Pittsburgh compound B, which is used to help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease
Pittsburgh compound B used in diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.
The label attaches to plaque and can be observed using PET scans.
Brain scans using Pittsburgh compound B
Brain scans using Pittsburgh compound B to locate plaque.
The computer translates the amount of isotope into a color scale, with red indicating a high level of radioactivity and yellow indicating somewhat less activity.
We can see from the scans that the cognitively healthy individual shows the presence of very little plaque in the brain (see Figure above ).
The individual with Alzheimer’s demonstrates high concentrations of the beta-amyloid in numerous areas of the brain.
Other studies have been done looking at brain function in drug addicts.
One of the theories about drug addiction involves the amount of dopamine action in the brain (a chemical that is a part of the system to transport nerve impulses).
Studies of dopamine action have been helpful in understanding addictive processes.
PET scans of dopamine in normal and addicted individuals
PET scan of dopamine binding in brains of normal and addicted individuals.
The Figure above shows the binding of chemicals that attach to dopamine receptors.
The non-addicted individuals have large numbers of receptors for dopamine.
The addicted persons show less binding to these receptors, indicating that fewer receptors are present.
Since dopamine is somehow linked with the sense of pleasure, these data may help to bring a better understanding to the biochemical processes in drug addiction.
PET scan techniques and results are described.
