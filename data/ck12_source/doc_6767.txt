The chemical potential energy stored in the bomb was converted into heat, sound, kinetic energy, and gravitational potential energy.
The kinetic and chemical potential energy stored in the bomb was converted into heat, sound, kinetic energy, and gravitational potential energy.
You hike up to the top of Granite Peak in the Trinity Alps to think about physics.
Do you have more potential or kinetic energy at the top of the mountain than you did at the bottom?
Explain.
Do you have more, less, or the same amount of energy at the top of the mountain than when you started? (Letâ€™s assume you did not eat anything on the way up.) Explain.
How has the total energy of the Solar System changed due to your hike up the mountain?
Explain.
If you push a rock off the top, will it end up with more, less, or the same amount of energy at the bottom?
Explain.
For each of the following types of energy, describe whether you gained it, you lost it, or it stayed the same during your hike:
Gravitational potential energy
Energy stored in the atomic nuclei in your body
Chemical potential energy stored in the fat cells in your body
Sound energy from your footsteps
Energy given to you by a wind blowing at your back
A 1200 kg> car traveling with a speed of 29 m/s drives horizontally off of a 90 m cliff.
Sketch the situation.
Calculate the potential energy, the kinetic energy, and the total energy of the car as it leaves the cliff.
Make a graph displaying the kinetic, gravitational potential, and total energy of the car at each 10 m increment of height as it drops
