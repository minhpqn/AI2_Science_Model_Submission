A:
If the same elements combine in different ratios, they form different compounds.
Same Elements, Different Compounds
Look at the Figure below of water (H 2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and read about these two compounds.
Both compounds consist of hydrogen and oxygen, but they have different ratios of the two elements.
As a result, water and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties.
If youâ€™ve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water!
Water and hydrogen peroxide have very different properties
Water:
Water is odorless and colorless.
We drink it, bathe in it, and use it to wash our clothes.
In fact, we can't live without it.
Hydrogen Peroxide:
Hydrogen peroxide is also odorless and colorless.
It's used as an antiseptic to kill germs on cuts.
It's also used as bleach to remove color form hair.
Q:
Read the Figure below about carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO).
Both compounds consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios.
How can you tell that carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are different compounds?
