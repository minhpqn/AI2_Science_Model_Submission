All living organisms have the ability to grow and change.
A seed may look like a pebble, but under the right conditions it will sprout and form a seedling that will grow into a larger plant.
The pebble of course will not grow.
Even the smallest bacteria must grow.
This bacteria will reproduce by dividing into two separate bacterium.
If the parent bacterium does not grow, then each subsequent generation will just be smaller then the previous generation.
Eventually the bacteria will be too small to function properly.
Tadpoles go through visible changes that show growth and development, a characteristic of life
Tadpoles, like those shown here, go through many changes to become adult frogs.
All living organisms must have the ability to reproduce.
Living things make more organisms like themselves.
Whether the organism is a rabbit, or a tree, or a bacterium, life will create more life.
If a species cannot create the next generation, the species will go extinct.
Reproduction is the process of making the next generation and may be a sexual or an asexual process.
Sexual reproduction involves two parents and the fusion of gametes , haploid sex cells from each parent.
Sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically unique and increases genetic variation within a species.
Asexual reproduction involves only one parent.
It occurs without a fusion of gametes and produces offspring that are all genetically identical to the parent.

All living organisms have a complex chemistry.
