How do transition metals form ions?
The transition metals are an interesting and challenging group of elements.
They have perplexing patterns of electron distribution that donâ€™t always follow the electron filling rules.
Predicting how they will form ions is also not always obvious.
Transition Metal Ions
Transition metals belong to the d block, meaning that the d sublevel of electrons is in the process of being filled with up to ten electrons.  Many transition metals cannot lose enough electrons to attain a noble-gas electron configuration.  In addition,  the majority of transition metals are capable of adopting ions with different charges.  Iron, which forms either the Fe 2+ or Fe 3+ ions, loses electrons as shown below.
