compound microscope :
An optical microscopes that has a series of lenses; has uses in many fields of science, particularly biology and geology.
electron microscope :
A microscope that uses electrons instead of light; allows a researcher to see things at very high magnification, far higher than an optical microscope can possibly magnify.
lab techniques :
The procedures used in science to carry out an experiment.
laboratory :

microscope :
An instrument used to view objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye.
