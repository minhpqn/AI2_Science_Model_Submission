The species that is less well adapted may get fewer of the resources that both species need.
As a result, members of that species are less likely to survive, and the species may go extinct.
Interspecific Competition and Specialization
Instead of extinction, interspecific competition may lead to greater specialization.
Specialization occurs when competing species evolve different adaptations.
For example, they may evolve adaptations that allow them to use different food sources.
Figure below describes an example.
Specialization lets ground anoles and tree anoles live together without competing
Specialization lets different species of anole lizards live in the same area without competing.
Competition is a relationship between organisms that strive for the same resources in the same place.
Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the same species.
It improves the speciesâ€™ adaptations.
Interspecific competition occurs between members of different species.
It may lead to one species going extinct or both becoming more specialized.
