This is because surface water absorbs oxygen from the air above it.
Water near shore generally has more dissolved nutrients than water farther from shore.
This is because most nutrients enter the water from land.
They are carried by runoff, streams, and rivers that empty into a body of water.
Water near the bottom of lakes and the ocean may contain more nutrients than water closer to the surface.
When aquatic organisms die, they sink to the bottom.
Decomposers near the bottom of the water break down the dead organisms and release their nutrients back into the water.
Aquatic biomes are distinguished by the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water.
The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters, while the aphotic zone is deeper than 200 meters.
Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes.
