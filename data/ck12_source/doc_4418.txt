Mammalian Locomotion.
Mammals have many different modes of locomotion.

Can you see why the other animals in the figure are specialized for their particular habitats?
Notice how arboreal , or tree-living animals, have a variety of different specializations for moving in trees.
For example, they may have:
A prehensile , or grasping, tail.
This is used for climbing and hanging from branches.
Very long arms for swinging from branch to branch.
This way of moving is called brachiation .
Sticky pads on their fingers.
The pads help them cling to tree trunks and branches.
Mammals live in social groups, which are an adaptive beneficial trait.
