Q:
What do you think causes these differences in the strength of acids and bases?
A:
The strength of an acid or a base depends on how much of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water.
Concentration of Ions
The strength of an acid depends on how many hydrogen ions it produces when it dissolves in water.
A stronger acid produces more hydrogen ions than a weaker acid.
For example, sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), which is found in car batteries, is a strong acid because nearly all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water.
On the other hand, acetic acid (CH 3 CO 2 H), which is the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid because less than 1 percent of it breaks down into ions in water.
The strength of a base depends on how many hydroxide ions it produces when it dissolves in water.
A stronger base produces more hydroxide ions than a weaker base.
For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base in drain cleaner, is a strong base because all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water.
Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), a base in antacids, is a weak base because only a small percentage of it breaks down into ions in water.
The pH Scale
The strength of acids and bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which is shown in the Figure below .
By definition, pH represents the acidity , or hydrogen ion (H + ) concentration, of a solution.
Pure water, which is neutral, has a pH of 7.
With a higher the concentration of hydrogen ions, a solution is more acidic and has a lower pH.
Acids have a pH less than 7, and the strongest acids have a pH close to zero.
Bases have a pH greater than 7, and the strongest bases have a pH close to 14.
