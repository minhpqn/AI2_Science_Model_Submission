This powdery substance is made up of spores, the reproductive structure of the fungus.
Reproduction in Fungi
Different fungi reproduce in different ways.
Many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually.
However, some reproduce only sexually and some only asexually.
Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual reproduction involves two parents.
Through asexual reproduction , new organisms are produced that are genetically identical to the parent.
That is, they have exactly the same DNA.
Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods:
Spores :
Spores are formed by the fungi and released to create new fungi.
This is the powdery substance released by puffballs.
Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria, plants, algae, fungi, and protozoa.
Theoretically, spores can reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring.
Obviously this does not happen.
If it did, the world would be covered by genetically identical fungi.
Budding:
The fungus grows a new part of its body, which eventually breaks off.
The broken-off piece becomes a “new” organism ( Figure below ).
Fragmentation:
