Humans have color vision that allows them to distinguish between objects of different colors
Humans with color vision see the apple on this tree; the bright red color of the apple stands out clearly from the green background of leaves.
Many animals only have black and white vision or are unable to distinguish between certain colors
This black-and-white picture gives an idea of how many animals see the world.
Dogs and cats would see the green and red colors as shades of gray; they are able to see blue, but red and green appear the same to them.
Many animals see just one or two colors.
Some see colors that we cannot see.
Apes and chimps see the same colors as us.
But whereas many animals cannot see colors, some animals see colors that we cannot.
The range of color vision of bees and butterflies for example, extends beyond the visible spectrum of light we can see.
The leaves of the flowers they pollinate have special ultraviolet patterns which guide the insects deep into the flower.
Evolution and Primate Vision
Why do you think primates, including humans, evolved the ability to see in three dimensions and in color?
To answer that question, you need to know a little about primate evolution.
Millions of years ago, primate ancestors lived in trees.
To move about in the trees, they needed to be able to judge how far away the next branch was.
Otherwise, they might have a dangerous fall.
Being able see in depth was important.
It was an adaptation that would help tree-living primates survive.
Primate ancestors also mainly ate fruit.
