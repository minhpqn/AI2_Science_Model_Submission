The human skin also makes vitamin D when it is exposed to ultraviolet light.
Vitamin D, in turn, is needed for strong bones and teeth.

Too much exposure to ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
As the “slip, slop, slap” slogan suggests, you can protect your skin from ultraviolet light by wearing clothing that covers your skin, applying sunscreen to any exposed areas, and wearing a hat to protect your head from exposure.
The SPF, or sun-protection factor, of sunscreen gives a rough idea of how long it protects the skin from sunburn (see Figure below ).
A sunscreen with a higher SPF value protects the skin longer.
Sunscreen must be applied liberally and often to be effective, and no sunscreen is completely waterproof.

Sunscreen helps protect skin from sunburn
Q:
You should apply sunscreen even on cloudy days.
Can you explain why?
A:
Ultraviolet light can travel through clouds, so it can harm unprotected skin even on cloudy days.
Sunlight contains the complete range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves.
The entire range is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
Electromagnetic waves that are commonly called light fall roughly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum.
