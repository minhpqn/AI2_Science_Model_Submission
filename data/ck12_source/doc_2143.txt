Conserving Natural Resources
How can we protect Earth’s natural resources?
One answer is conservation .
This means saving resources.
We need to save resources so some will be left for the future.
We also need to protect resources from pollution and overuse.
When we conserve resources, we also cut down on the trash we produce.
Americans throw out 340 million tons of trash each year.
We throw out 2.5 million plastic bottles alone—every hour!
Most of what we throw out ends up in landfills ( Figure below ).
In a landfill, all those plastic bottles take hundreds of years to break down.
What are the problems caused by producing so much trash?
Natural resources must be used to produce the materials.
