State Charles’ Law.
Use this law to perform calculations involving volume-temperature relationships.
When bread is baked, the carbon dioxide inside expands
How do you bake bread?
Everybody enjoys the smell and taste of freshly-baked bread.
It is light and fluffy as a result of the action of yeast on sugar.
The yeast converts the sugar to carbon dioxide, which at high temperatures causes the dough to expand.
The end-result is an enjoyable treat, especially when covered with melted butter.
As a gas is heated at constant pressure, its volume increases
As a container of confined gas is heated, its molecules increase in kinetic energy and push the movable piston outward, resulting in an increase in volume.
French physicist Jacques Charles (1746-1823) studied the effect of temperature on the volume of a gas at constant pressure.
Charles’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas when pressure is kept constant.
The absolute temperature is temperature measured with the Kelvin scale.
The Kelvin scale must be used because zero on the Kelvin scale corresponds to a complete stoppage of molecular motion.
Mathematically, the direct relationship of Charles’s law can be represented by the following equation:
As with Boyle’s law, k is constant only for a given gas sample.
The Table below shows temperature and volume data for a set amount of gas at a constant pressure.
The third column is the constant for this particular data set and is always equal to the volume divided by the Kelvin temperature.
When this data is graphed, the result is a straight line, indicative of a direct relationship, shown in Figure below .
The volume of a gas increases as the Kelvin temperature increases
