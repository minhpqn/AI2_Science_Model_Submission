Just donâ€™t try to stretch the limits any further unless you want a traffic ticket.
The significant figures in a measurement consist of all the certain digits in that measurement plus one uncertain or estimated digit.
In the ruler illustration below, the bottom ruler gave a length with 2 significant figures, while the top ruler gave a length with 3 significant figures.
In a correctly reported measurement, the final digit is significant but not certain.
Insignificant digits are not reported.
With either ruler, it would not be possible to report the length as 2.553 cm as there is no possible way that the thousandths digit could be estimated.
The 3 is not significant and would not be reported.
Uncertainty in measurement on a ruler
Measurement with two different rulers.
When you look at a reported measurement, it is necessary to be able to count the number of significant figures.  The Table below details the rules for determining the number of significant figures in a reported measurement.
For the examples in the table, assume that the quantities are correctly reported values of a measured quantity.
Significant Figure Rules
All nonzero digits in a measurement are significant
A. 237 has three significant figures.
B. 1.897 has four significant figures.
Zeros that appear between other nonzero digits are always significant.
A. 39,004 has five significant figures.
B. 5.02 has three significant figures
Zeros that appear in front of all of the nonzero digits are called left-end zeros.  Left-end zeros are never significant
A. 0.008 has one significant figure.
