All living things need energy all the time just to stay alive.
Whether it’s running a marathon or simply taking a breath, energy is required.
Where does all that energy come from?
The answer is chemical reactions.
Chemical Reactions in Living Things
Chemical reactions that take place inside living things are called biochemical reactions ( bio- means “life”).
It’s not just for energy that living things depend on biochemical reactions.
Every function and structure of a living organism depends on thousands of biochemical reactions taking place in each cell.
The sum of all these biochemical reactions is called metabolism.
Catabolic and Anabolic Reactions
Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions and anabolic reactions.
You can watch an animation showing how the two categories of reactions are related at this URL:
Catabolic reactions involve breaking bonds.
Larger molecules are broken down to smaller ones.
For example, complex carbohydrates are broken down to simple sugars.
Catabolic reactions release energy, so they are exothermic.
Anabolic reactions involve forming bonds.
Smaller molecules are combined to form larger ones.
For example, simple sugars are combined to form complex carbohydrates.
Anabolic reactions require energy, so they are endothermic.
