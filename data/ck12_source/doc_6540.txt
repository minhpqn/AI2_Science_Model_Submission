An unsaturated hydrocarbon is a hydrocarbon that contains less than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that can possibly bond with the number of carbon atoms present.
The location of the carbon-carbon double bond can vary.
The 4-carbon alkene generic name is butene.
Since the double bond can be located in more than one place, we have 1-butene and 2-butene:
Nomenclature of monoalkenes
Molecules with multiple double bonds are also quite common.
The formula below shows a four-carbon chain with double bonds between carbons 1 and 2 and between carbons 3 and 4.
This molecule is called 1,3-butadiene.
Nomenclature of dienes
An alkyne is a hydrocarbon with one or more carbon-carbon triple covalent bonds .
The simplest alkyne consists of two carbon atoms and is called ethyne (common name: acetylene).
Ethyne is the simplest alkyne
The ethyne molecule is linear, with sp hybridization for each carbon atom.
The general formula of alkynes with one triple bond is C n H 2n-2 .
Alkynes are also unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Other alkynes exist, such as 2-pentyne:
