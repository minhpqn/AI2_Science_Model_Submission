Electric Circuits:
Capacitors
The Big Idea
When current flows through wires and resistors in a circuit as a result of a difference in electric potential, charge does not build up significantly anywhere on its path.
Capacitors are devices placed in electric circuits where charge can build up.
The amount of charge a capacitor can store before it “fills up” depends on its shape and how much electric potential is applied.
The ratio of charge stored in a capacitor to the voltage applied is called its capacitance , measured in Farads (F) .
The larger the electric potential in volts, the stronger the electric field that is used to “cram” the charge into the device.
Any capacitor will fill up with enough charge.
Capacitors store energy when charged, and release it when they discharge.

Students will learn how a capacitor works and how to solve basic problems involving the classic two plate capacitor.
\begin{cases}\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{F/m} & \text{Constant called the permittivity of free space}\\Q = CV & \text{Charge stored in a capacitor}\\C = \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{d} & \text{For two parallel metal plates, area A} \text{, separation} \; d, \text{dielectric} \; \kappa\\\end{cases}
A capacitor is a device that stores charge.
It is typically two very large flat plates wrapped in a cylinder with a dielectric substance in between the two.
The dielectric allows the plates to be at a high voltage (and thus store more charge) without arcing between them.
The capacitance, literally tells you how much charge it can hold.
The capacitance of a capacitor only depends on its geometry.
Here some important things to keep in mind in regards to capacitors:
