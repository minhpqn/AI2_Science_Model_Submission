Denaturation step :
This step is the first regular cycling event and consists of heating the reaction to 94 - 98°C for 30 to 60 seconds.
It disrupts the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases of the DNA strands, yielding single strands of DNA.
Annealing step :
The reaction temperature is lowered to 50-65°C for 30 to 60 seconds, allowing annealing of the primers to the single-stranded DNA template.
Stable hydrogen bonds form between the DNA strand (the template) and the primers when the primer sequence very closely matches the complementary template sequence.
Primers are usually 17 - 22 nucleotides long and are carefully designed to bind to only one site in the genome.
The polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA synthesis.
Extension step :
A temperature of around 72°C is used for this step, which is close to the optimum temperature of Taq polymerase.
At this step the Taq polymerase extends the primer by adding dNTPs, using one DNA strand as a template to create a the other (new) DNA strand.
The extension time depends on the length of the DNA fragment to be amplified.
As a standard, at its optimum temperature, the DNA polymerase will polymerize a thousand bases in one minute.
The Polymerase Chain Reaction.
The polymerase chain reaction involves three steps.
High temperatures are needed for the process to work.
The enzyme Taq polymerase is used in step 3 because it can withstand high temperatures.
Utilizing PCR, DNA can be amplified millions of times to generate quantities of DNA that can be used for a number of purposes.
These include the use of DNA for prenatal or genetic testing, such as testing for a specific mutation.
PCR has revolutionized the fields of biotechnology, human genetics, and a number of other sciences.
