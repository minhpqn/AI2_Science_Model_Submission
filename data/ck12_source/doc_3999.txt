A tick bites a mouse and picks up the bacteria.
The tick may then bite a human who invades the natural habitat.
Through the bite, the bacteria are transmitted to the human host.
Bacteria in food or water usually can be killed by heating it to a high temperature (generally, at least 71°C, or 160°F).
Bacteria on many surfaces can be killed with chlorine bleach or other disinfectants.
Bacterial infections in people can be treated with antibiotic drugs .
For example, if you ever had “strep” throat, you were probably treated with an antibiotic.
Antibiotics have saved many lives.
However, misuse and over-use of the drugs have led to antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
Figure below shows how antibiotic resistance evolves.
Some strains of bacteria are now resistant to most common antibiotics.
These infections are very difficult to treat.

This diagram shows how antibiotic resistance evolves by natural selection.
Bacteria and humans have many important relationships.
Bacteria provide humans with a number of services.
They also cause human diseases.
