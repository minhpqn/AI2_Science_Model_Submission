Kinetic Theory of Matter
State the kinetic theory of matter.
Relate kinetic energy to state of matter.
This neat row of cola bottles represents matter in three different states—solid, liquid, and gas.
The bottles and caps are solids, the cola is a liquid, and carbon dioxide dissolved in the cola is a gas.
It gives cola its fizz.
Solids, liquids, and gases such as these have different properties.
Solids have a fixed shape and a fixed volume.
Liquids also have a fixed volume but can change their shape.
Gases have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.
What explains these differences in states of matter?
The answer has to do with energy.
Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter.
For example, your body uses chemical energy when you lift your arm or take a step.
In both cases, energy is used to move matter—you.
Any matter that is moving has energy just because it’s moving.
The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy.
Scientists think that the particles of all matter are in constant motion.
In other words, the particles of matter have kinetic energy.
The theory that all matter consists of constantly moving particles is called the kinetic theory of matter .
