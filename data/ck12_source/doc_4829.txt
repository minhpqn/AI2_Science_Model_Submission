A molecule with an unequal distribution of charge throughout the molecule.
specific heat :
The amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius.
surface tension :
The energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid due to intermolecular forces.
Water molecules are polar, so they form hydrogen bonds.
This gives water unique properties, such as a relatively high boiling point, high specific heat, cohesion, adhesion and density.
