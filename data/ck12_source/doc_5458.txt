Human Genome Project :
A project to understand the genetic make-up of the human species by determining the DNA sequence of the human genome and the genome of a few model organisms.
recombinant DNA :
DNA engineered through the combination of two or more DNA strands; combines DNA sequences which would not normally occur together.
Biotechnology is technology based on biological applications, combining many features of Biology including genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, embryology, and cell biology.
The goal of the Human Genome Project is to understand the genetic make-up of the human species by determining the DNA sequence of the human genome and the genome of a few model organisms.
Sequencing of DNA is necessary for the analysis of genes and the genome.
