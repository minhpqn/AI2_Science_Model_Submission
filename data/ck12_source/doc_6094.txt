The volume of a gas increases as the Kelvin temperature increases.
Notice that the line goes exactly toward the origin, meaning that as the absolute temperature of the gas approaches zero, its volume approaches zero.
However, when a gas is brought to extremely cold temperatures, its molecules would eventually condense into the liquid state before reaching absolute zero.
The temperature at which this change into the liquid state occurs varies for different gases.
Charles’s Law can also be used to compare changing conditions for a gas.
Now we use V_1 and  T_1 to stand for the initial volume and temperature of a gas, while V_2 and  T_2 stand for the final volume and temperature.
The mathematical relationship of Charles’s Law becomes:
This equation can be used to calculate any one of the four quantities if the other three are known.
The direct relationship will only hold if the temperatures are expressed in Kelvin.
Temperatures in Celsius will not work.
Recall the relationship that K = °C + 273.
Sample Problem:
Charles’s Law
A balloon is filled to a volume of 2.20 L at a temperature of 22°C.
The balloon is then heated to a temperature of 71°C.
Find the new volume of the balloon.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
V_1=2.20 \text{ L}
T_1=22^\circ \text{C}=295 \text{ K}
