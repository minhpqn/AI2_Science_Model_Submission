Charles Lyell (1797–1875) was a well-known English geologist.
Darwin took Lyell's book, Principles of Geology, with him on the Beagle .
In the book, Lyell argued that gradual geological processes have gradually shaped Earth’s surface.
From this, Lyell inferred that Earth must be far older than most people believed.
Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) was an English economist.
He wrote an essay titled On Population .
In the essay, Malthus argued that human populations grow faster than the resources they depend on.
When populations become too large, famine and disease break out.
In the end, this keeps populations in check by killing off the weakest members.
These weren’t the only influences on Darwin.
He was also aware that humans could breed plants and animals to have useful traits.
By selecting which animals were allowed to reproduce, they could change an organism’s traits.
The pigeons in Figure below are good examples.
Darwin called this type of change in organisms artificial selection .
He used the word ‘‘artificial’’ to distinguish it from natural selection.
Artificial selection in pigeons to form the carrier pigeon and fantail pigeon
Artificial Selection in Pigeons.
Pigeon hobbyists breed pigeons to have certain characteristics.
Both of the pigeons in the bottom row were bred from the common rock pigeon.
Did you ever hear the saying that “great minds think alike?” It certainly applies to Charles Darwin and another English naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace .
