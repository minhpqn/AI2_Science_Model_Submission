The Genetic Code (Advanced) and Protein Synthesis:
Translation (Advanced) concepts.
Remember that proteins are made out of amino acids.
How does the information in the gene get converted from the language of nucleotides to the language of amino acids?
The process is called translation .
The amino acids are placed in a specific order during translation.
The order is specified by the codons in the mRNA, which is produced during transcription.
As the mRNA sequence is based on the gene sequence in the DNA, the order of amino acids that makes the protein is based on the gene sequence as well.
The three RNAs involved in protein synthesis are summarized here:
mRNA (messenger RNA):
Produced during transcription.
Carries the genetic instructions of a gene from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm.
rRNA (ribosomal RNA):
Together with proteins, composes the ribosome, the organelles that are the site of protein synthesis.
tRNA (transfer RNA):
Brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome during translation.

The D arm (D) is one stem ending in a loop.
The anticodon arm (A) is a second stem whose loop contains the anticodon on the bottom of the tRNA.
The T arm (T) is the third stem opposite the D arm.
