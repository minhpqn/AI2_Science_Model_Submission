Problems of the Excretory System
The urinary system controls the amount of water in the body and removes wastes.
Any problem with the urinary system can also affect many other body systems.
In some cases, certain mineral wastes can form kidney stones ( Figure below ).
Stones form in the kidneys and may be found anywhere in the urinary system.
Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together.
They can vary in size, from small stones that can flow through your urinary system, to larger stones that cannot.
Some stones cause great pain, while others cause very little pain.
Some stones may need to be removed by surgery or ultrasound treatments.

What are the symptoms of kidney stones?
You may have a kidney stone if you have pain while urinating, see blood in your urine, and/or feel a sharp pain in your back or lower abdomen (the area between your chest and hips).
The pain may last for a long or short time.
You may also have nausea and vomiting with the pain.
If you have a small stone that passes on its own easily, you may not experience any symptoms.
If you have some of these symptoms, you should see your doctor.
Kidney failure happens when the kidneys cannot remove wastes from the blood.
If the kidneys are unable to filter wastes from the blood, the wastes build up in the body.
