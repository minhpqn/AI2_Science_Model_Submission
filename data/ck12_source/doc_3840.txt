Sponges are frequently used as shelter for small crabs, shrimps, and other invertebrates.
Major Trends in Animal Evolution
The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old.
By 500 million years ago, most modern phyla of animals had evolved.
Figure below shows when some of the major events in animal evolution took place.
The geologic time scale
Partial Geologic Time Scale.
This portion of the geologic time scale shows major events in animal evolution.
Who were the ancestors of the earliest animals?
They may have been marine protists that lived in colonies.
Scientists think that cells of some protist colonies became specialized for different jobs.
After a while, the specialized cells came to need each other for survival.
Thus, the first multicellular animal evolved.
Look at the cells in Figure below .
One type of sponge cell, the choanocyte , looks a lot like the protist cell.
How does this support the hypothesis that animals evolved from protists?

Sponge choanocytes look a lot like choanoflagellate protists.
