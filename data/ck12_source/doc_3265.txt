Q:
Look back at the rainbow that opened this article.
Do you see all the different colors of light, from red at the top to violet at the bottom?
What causes a rainbow to form?
A:
Individual raindrops act as tiny prisms.
They separate sunlight into its different wavelengths and create a rainbow of colors.
Colors of Objects
An opaque object is one that doesnâ€™t let light pass through it.
Instead, it reflects or absorbs the light that strikes it.
Many objects, such as the leaves pictured in the Figure below , reflect just one or a few wavelengths of visible light and absorb the rest.
The wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that an object appears to the human eye.
For example, the leaves appear green because they reflect green light and absorb light of other wavelengths.
Leaves are green because they reflect green light
A transparent or translucent material, such as window glass, transmits some or all of the light that strikes it.
This means that the light passes through the material rather than being reflected by it.
In this case, we see the material because of the transmitted light.
Therefore, the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the object appears.
Look at the beautiful stained glass windows in the Figure below .
The different colors of glass transmit light of different colors.
