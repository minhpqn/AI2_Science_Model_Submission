Consider the following situation:
A 20.0 liter vessel contains 1.0 mol of hydrogen gas at a pressure of 600 mmHg.
Another 20.0 liter vessel contains 3.0 mol of helium at a pressure of 1800 mmHg.
These two gases are mixed together in an identical 20.0 liter vessel.
Because each will exert its own pressure according to Dalton’s law, we can express the partial pressures as follows:
P_{H_2}=X_{H_2} \times P_{\text{Total}} \quad \text{and} \quad P_{He}=X_{He} \times P_{\text{Total}}
The partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is equal to its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure.
For our mixture of hydrogen and helium:
X_{H_2}=\frac{1.0 \ \text{mol}}{1.0 \ \text{mol}+3.0 \ \text{mol}}=0.25 \quad \text{and} \quad X_{He}=\frac{3.0 \ \text{mol}}{1.0 \ \text{mol} + 3.0 \ \text{mol}}=0.75
The total pressure according to Dalton’s law is 600 \text{ mmHg} + 1800 \text{ mmHg} = 2400 \text{ mmHg} .
So, each partial pressure will be:
& P_{H_2}=0.25 \times 2400 \text{ mmHg}=600 \text{ mmHg} \\& P_{He}=0.75 \times 2400 \text{ mmHg}=1800 \text{ mmHg}
The partial pressures of each gas in the mixture don’t change since they were mixed into the same size vessel and the temperature was not changed.
Sample Problem:
Dalton’s Law
A flask contains a mixture of 1.24 moles of hydrogen gas and 2.91 moles of oxygen gas.
If the total pressure is 104 kPa, what is the partial pressure of each gas?
