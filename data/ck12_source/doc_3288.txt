Did you ever hear the proverb, “the eyes are the windows to the soul”?
While it’s true that our eyes often express what we are thinking or feeling, they are windows in another sense as well.
Like windows made of glass, the eyes let light in and allow us to see.
Structure and Function of the Eye
The human eye is an organ that is specialized to collect light and focus images.
The structures of the human eye are shown in the Figure below .
Examine each structure in the diagram as you read about it below.
Diagram of the eye
The sclera, also known as the white of the eye, is an opaque outer covering that protects the eye.
It keeps light out of the eye except at the center front of the eye.
The cornea is a transparent outer covering of the front of the eye.
It protects the eye and also acts as a convex lens.
A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges and makes rays of light converge, or meet at a point.
The shape of the cornea helps focus light that enters the eye.
The pupil is an opening in the front of the eye.
It looks black because it doesn’t reflect any light.
All the light passes through it instead.
The pupil controls the amount of light that enters the eye.
It automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed.
The iris is the colored part of the eye.
