Density Calculations
An 18.2 g sample of zinc metal has a volume of 2.55 cm 3 .
Calculate the density of zinc.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
mass = 18.2 g
volume = 2.55 cm 3
density = ? g/cm 3
Use the equation for density, D = \frac{m}{V} , to solve the problem.
Step 2:
Calculate
D=\frac{m}{V}=\frac{18.2 \ \text{g}}{2.55 \ \text{cm}^3}=7.14 \ \text{g}/\text{cm}^3
Step 3:
Think about your result.
If 1 cm 3 of zinc has a mass of about 7 grams, then 2 and a half cm 3 will have a mass about 2 and a half times as great.
Metals are expected to have a density greater than that of water and zincâ€™s density falls within the range of the other metals listed above
Since density values are known for many substances, density can be used to determine an unknown mass or an unknown volume.
Dimensional analysis will be used to ensure that units cancel appropriately.
