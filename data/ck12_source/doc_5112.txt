But making foods is not the only beneficial role of bacteria.
For example, they also play an essential role in your gut!
Can we survive without bacteria?
Could bacteria survive without us?
No and yes.
No, we could not survive without bacteria.
And yes, bacteria could survive without us.
Bacteria can be used to make cheese from milk.
The bacteria turn the milk sugars into lactic acid.
The acid is what causes the milk to curdle to form cheese.
Bacteria are also involved in producing other foods.
Yogurt is made by using bacteria to ferment milk ( Figure below ).
Fermenting cabbage with bacteria produces sauerkraut.
Yogurt is made from milk fermented with bacteria
Yogurt is made from milk fermented with bacteria.
The bacteria ingest natural milk sugars and release lactic acid as a waste product, which causes proteins in the milk to form into a solid mass, which becomes the yogurt.
In the laboratory, bacteria can be changed to provide us with a variety of useful materials.
Bacteria can be used as tiny factories to produce desired chemicals and medicines.
For example, insulin, which is necessary to treat people with diabetes, can be produced using bacteria.
Through the process of transformation, the human gene for insulin is placed into bacteria.
