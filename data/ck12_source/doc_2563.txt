The atomic number of copper is 29.
This number represents the number of protons in each atom of copper. (Copper is the element that makes up the coil of wire in photo A of the opening sequence of photos.)
Periods of the Modern Periodic Table
Rows of the modern periodic table are called periods , as they are in Mendeleev’s table.
From left to right across a period, each element has one more proton than the element before it.
Some periods in the modern periodic table are longer than others.
For example, period 1 contains only two elements: hydrogen (H) and helium (He).
In contrast, periods 6 and 7 are so long that many of their elements are placed below the main part of the table.
They are the elements starting with lanthanum (La) in period 6 and actinium (Ac) in period 7.
Some elements in period 7 have not yet been named.
They are represented by temporary three-letter symbols, such as Uub.
The number of each period represents the number of energy levels that have electrons in them for atoms of each element in that period.
Q:
Find calcium (Ca) in the Figure above .
How many energy levels have electrons in them for atoms of calcium?
A:
Calcium is in period 4, so its atoms have electrons in them for the first four energy levels.
Groups of the Modern Periodic Table
Columns of the modern table are called groups , as they are in Mendeleev’s table.
However, the modern table has many more groups—18 compared with just 8 in Mendeleev’s table.
