Often, because many of these genes regulate the processes that prevent most damage to the genes themselves, DNA damage accumulates as one ages.
Usually, oncogenes are dominant alleles, as they contain gain-of-function mutations .
The actions of the mutant allele gene product, many times resulting in a constitutively activated protein, are dominant to the gene product produced by the "normal" allele.
Meanwhile, mutated tumor suppressors are generally recessive alleles, as they contain loss-of-function mutations .
A proto-oncogene needs only a mutation in one copy of the gene to generate an oncogene; a tumor suppressor gene needs a mutation in both copies of the gene to render both products defective.
There are instances when, however, one mutated allele of a tumor suppressor gene can render the other copy non-functional.
These instances result in what is known as a dominant negative effect .
Cancers are caused by a series of mutations.
Each mutation alters the behavior of the cell.
In this example, the first mutation inactivates a tumor suppressor gene, the second mutation inactivates a DNA repair gene, the third mutation creates an oncogene, and a fourth mutation inactivates several more tumor suppressor genes, resulting in cancer.
It should be noted that it does not necessarily require four or more mutations to lead to cancer.
cancer :
A disease characterized by a population of cells that grow and divide without respect to normal limits.
carcinogen :
A cancer causing agent, such as tobacco smoke, radiation, chemicals, or certain infectious agents.
carcinogenesis :
The process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells; also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis.
dominant negative effect :
Due to a mutation that results in an altered gene product that acts in a dominant manner to the wild-type gene product.
gain-of-function mutation :
