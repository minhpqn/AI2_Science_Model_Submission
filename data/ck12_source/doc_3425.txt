Bio-Inspiration:
Nature as Muse
For hundreds of years, scientists have been using design ideas from structures in nature.
Now, biologists and engineers at the University of California, Berkeley are working together to design a broad range of new products, such as life-saving milli-robots modeled on the way cockroaches run and adhesives based on the amazing design of a gecko's foot.
This process starts with making observations of nature, which lead to asking questions and to the additional aspects of the scientific process.

Microscopes are arguably one of the most important tools of the biologist.
They allow the visualization of smaller and smaller biological organisms and molecules.
With greatly magnified powers, these instruments are becoming increasingly important in modern day research.
See the following KQED videos for additional information on these remarkable tools.

An experiment is a special type of scientific investigation that is performed under controlled conditions, usually in a laboratory.
An experiment generally tests how one variable is affected by another.
The sample size in an experiment directly affects the interpretation of the results.
Repetition is the repeating of an experiment, validating the results.
