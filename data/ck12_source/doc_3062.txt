This man is pushing heavy boxes on a dolly.
If he were to push the boxes across the ground without the dolly, it would take a lot more force because he would have to overcome the sliding friction between the boxes and the ground.
Using a dolly reduces the friction because rolling friction between the wheels and the ground is much less than sliding friction.
Machines and Friction
A dolly is a machine because it changes a force to make work easier.
What is work?
In physics, work is defined as the use of force to move an object over a distance.
It is represented by the equation:
Work = Force x Distance
All machines make work easier, but they don’t increase the amount of work that is done.
You can never get more work out of a machine than you put into it.
In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine.
That’s because a machine must use some of the work put into it to overcome friction.
Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching.
All machines involve motion, so they all have friction.
How much work is needed to overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efficiency.
Efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user (input work) that becomes work done by the machine (output work).
The output work is always less than the input work because some of the input work is used to overcome friction.
Therefore, efficiency is always less than 100 percent.
The closer to 100 percent a machine’s efficiency is, the better it is at reducing friction.
