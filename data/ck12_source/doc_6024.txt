Solve.
First, calculate the number of moles of Ag and S present:
50.0 \text{ g Ag} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol Ag}}{107.87 \text{ g Ag}} &= 0.464 \text{ mol Ag}\\10.0 \text{ g S} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol S}}{32.07 \text{ g S}} &= 0.312 \text{ mol S}
Second, find the moles of S that would be required to react with all of the given Ag:
0.464 \text{ mol Ag} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol S}}{2 \text{ mol Ag}}=0.232 \text{ mol S} \ (\text{required})
The amount of S actually present is 0.312 moles.
The amount of S that is required to fully react with all of the Ag is 0.232 moles.
Since there is more sulfur present than what is required to react, the sulfur is the excess reactant.
Therefore, silver is the limiting reactant.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The balanced equation indicates that the necessary mole ratio of Ag to S is 2:1.
Since there were not twice as many moles of Ag present in the original amounts, that makes silver the limiting reactant.
There is a very important point to consider about the preceding problem.
Even though the mass of silver present in the reaction (50.0 g) was greater than the mass of sulfur (10.0 g), silver was the limiting reactant.
This is because chemists must always convert to molar quantities and consider the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation.
There is one other thing that we would like to be able to determine in a limiting reactant problem - the quantity of the excess reactant that will be left over after the reaction is complete.
We will go back to the sample problem above to answer this question.
