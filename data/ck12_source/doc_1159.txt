The crust on the right is in the ocean.
You may have seen pictures, but to see it in person you need special equipment.
Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition.
It's understandable that scientists know the most about the crust, and less about deeper layers.
Earth’s crust is a thin, brittle outer shell.
The crust is made of rock.
This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges.
There are two kinds of crust.
Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor ( Figure below ).
It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles).
The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm 3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents.
Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor.
Gabbro is a dark dense rock that can be found in oceanic crust
Gabbro is a dark dense rock that can be found in oceanic crust.
Continental crust is much thicker than oceanic crust.
It is 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average, but it varies a lot.
Continental crust is made up of many different rocks ( Figure below ).
All three major rock types—igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary—are found in the crust.
On average, continental crust is much less dense (2.7 g/cm 3 ) than oceanic crust.
Since it is less dense, it rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust.
