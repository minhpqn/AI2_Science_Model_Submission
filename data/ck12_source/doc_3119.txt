Chemical energy is energy that is stored in the bonds between the atoms of compounds.
If the bonds are broken, the energy is released and can be converted to other forms of energy.
Portable amplifiers have batteries that store chemical energy
This portable guitar amplifier can run on batteries.
Batteries store chemical energy and change it to electrical energy.
Electrical energy is the energy of moving electrons.
Electrons flow through wires to create electric current.
Electrical energy is used to power these bright lights
The bright lights on this stage use electrical energy.
They are wired into the electrical system of the of the hall.
The guitars and microphone also use electrical energy.
You can see the electrical cords running from them to the outlet on the floor below the musicians.
Electromagnetic energy is energy that travels through space as electrical and magnetic waves.
The light flooding the stage in the Figure above is one type of electromagnetic energy.
Other types include radio waves, microwaves, X rays, and gamma rays.
Thermal energy is the energy of moving atoms of matter.
All matter has thermal energy because atoms of all matter are constantly moving.
An object with more mass has greater thermal energy than an object with less mass because it has more atoms.
Thermal energy is generated when people exercise
Why is this jogger sweating so much?
