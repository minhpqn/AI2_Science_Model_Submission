Left:
This mother gull will feed her chick after it pecks at a red spot on her beak.
Both pecking and feeding behaviors are innate.
Right:
When these baby birds open their mouths wide, their mother instinctively feeds them.
This innate behavior is called gaping.
Another example of innate behavior in birds is egg rolling.
It happens in some species of water birds, like the graylag goose ( Figure below ).
Graylag geese make nests on the ground.
If an egg rolls out of the nest, a mother goose uses her bill to push it back into the nest.
Returning the egg to the nest helps ensure that the egg will hatch.
A goose returning an egg to the nest is an innate behavior
This female graylag goose is a ground-nesting water bird.
Before her chicks hatch, the mother protects the eggs.
She will use her bill to push eggs back into the nest if they roll out.
This is an example of an innate behavior.
How could this behavior increase the gooseâ€™s fitness?
Innate Behavior in Human Beings
All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings.
Can you think of human behaviors that do not have to be learned?
