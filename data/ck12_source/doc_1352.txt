Another way is if the pressure on the rock decreases; this will lower the rock's melting temperature.
The melting temperature of a rock also goes down if water is added.
Every time there is a volcanic eruption, one or more of these things happens.
For each type of volcano mentioned in these concepts, think about how and why melting occurs.
Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct
Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct.
Of all the volcanoes in the world, very few are erupting at any given time.
Scientists question whether a volcano that is not erupting will ever erupt again and then describe it as active, dormant, or extinct.
Active :
Currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon.
Dormant :
No current activity, but has erupted recently.
Extinct :
No activity for some time; will probably not erupt again.
Volcanoes are located along convergent and divergent plate boundaries.
They can be found in the middle of plates at hot spots.
Magma can be created when temperature rises, pressure lowers, or water is added.
Volcanoes may be active, dormant, or extinct.
This depends on whether there is the possibility of magma in their magma chambers.
