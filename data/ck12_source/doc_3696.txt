Only bacteria that contain the recombinant DNA are selected for further use.
Ligation.
DNA ligase joins together an isolated gene and plasmid DNA.
This produces recombinant DNA.
Recombinant DNA technology is discussed in the following videos and animations:  (4.36),
The experiments of Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer, pioneers of genetic engineering, are explained in the video at .

Polymerase Chain Reaction
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) makes many copies of a gene or other DNA segment.
This might be done in order to make large quantities of a gene for genetic testing.
PCR involves three steps: denaturing , annealing , and extension .
The three steps are illustrated in Figure below .
They are repeated many times in a cycle to make large quantities of the gene.

Denaturing involves heating DNA to break the bonds holding together the two DNA strands.
This yields two single strands of DNA.
Annealing involves cooling the single strands of DNA and mixing them with short DNA segments called primers .
Primers have base sequences that are complementary to segments of the single DNA strands.
