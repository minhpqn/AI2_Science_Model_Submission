Q:
How is a circuit diagram simpler and easier to understand than an actual electric circuit?
A:
A circuit diagram shows only the parts of the circuit that carry electric current, and it uses simple symbols to represent them.
A model is a representation of an object, system, or process that is simpler and easier to understand than the real thing.
Examples of simple models in physical science include two-dimensional models of molecules and electric circuits.

What is a model?
Why are models useful in science?
Identify characteristics of a good model.
Describe a simple model in physical science.
Safety in Science
Identify the meaning of lab safety symbols.
List rules for staying safe in the lab.
State what to do in case of accidents in the lab or field.
Research in physical science can be exciting, but it also has potential dangers.
For example, the field scientist in this photo is collecting water samples from treatment ponds.
There are many microorganisms in the water that could make him sick.
The water and shore can also be strewn with dangerous objects such as sharp can lids and broken glass bottles that could cause serious injury.
Whether in the field or in the lab, knowing how to stay safe in science is important.
