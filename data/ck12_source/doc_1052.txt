Meteorology includes the study of weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
Meteorology is very important.
Using radars and satellites, meteorologists work to predict, or forecast, the weather ( Figure below ).
Meteorologists are getting better at predicting the weather all the time.
Meteorologists wonder how to better predict weather.
They wonder what the effects of rising water vapor in the atmosphere will be on weather.

Meteorologists forecast the weather a region can expect from a tropical storm.
Climatologists also study the atmosphere.
These scientists work to understand the climate as it is now.
They also study how climate will change in response to global warming.
There are lots of questions to ask about our changing climate.
Environmental scientists study the effects people have on their environment.
This includes the landscape, atmosphere, water, and living things.
These scientists ask all sorts of questions about how Earth systems are changing as a result of human actions.
They try to predict what changes will come in the future.
Ecologists study lifeforms and the environments they live in ( Figure below ).
They try to predict the chain reactions that could occur when one part of the ecosystem is disrupted.
