A double-replacement reaction is a reaction in which the positive and negative ions of two ionic compounds exchange places to form two new compounds.
The general form of a double-replacement (also called double-displacement) reaction is:
AB+CD \rightarrow AD+CB
In this reaction,  A and  C are positively-charged cations, while  B and  D are negatively-charged anions.
Double-replacement reactions generally occur between substances in aqueous solution.
In order for a reaction to occur, one of the products is usually a solid precipitate, a gas, or a molecular compound such as water.
Formation of a Precipitate
A precipitate forms in a double-replacement reaction when the cations from one of the reactants combine with the anions from the other reactant to form an insoluble ionic compound.
When aqueous solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate are mixed, the following reaction occurs.
2\text{KI}(aq)+\text{Pb(NO}_3)_2(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{KNO}_3(aq)+\text{PbI}_2 (s)
There are very strong attractive forces that occur between Pb 2+ and I âˆ’ ions and the result is a brilliant yellow precipitate (see Figure below ).
The other product of the reaction, potassium nitrate, remains soluble.

Formation of a Gas
Some double-replacement reactions produce a gaseous product which then bubbles out of the solution and escapes into the air.
When solutions of sodium sulfide and hydrochloric acid are mixed, the products of the reaction are aqueous sodium chloride and hydrogen sulfide gas.
\text{Na}_2\text{S}(aq)+2\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{S}(g)
Formation of a Molecular Compound
Another kind of double-replacement reaction is one that produces a molecular compound as one of its products.
