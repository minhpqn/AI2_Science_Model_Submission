Describe the structural differences between prokaryotic and eukayrotic ribosomes.
The Golgi Apparatus - Advanced
Outline the form and function of the Golgi apparatus.
The Golgi apparatus is said to look like a stack of deflated balloons.
In essence, that is what the Golgi apparatus is.
Not balloons, but plasma membrane.
The Golgi apparatus is a series of stacks of membrane, with some extremely important functions.
The Golgi Apparatus
The Golgi apparatus , which is also known as the Golgi complex or Golgi body, is a large organelle found in most eukaryotic cells.
It was identified in 1898 by the Italian physician Camillo Golgi.
The Golgi apparatus is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered stacks of discs called cisternae (singular, cisterna ), as shown in Figure below .
Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus.
A typical mammalian cell will have 40 to 80 of these stacks.
While plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks scattered throughout the cytoplasm.
In plants, the Golgi apparatus contains enzymes that synthesize some of the cell wall polysaccharides.
The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell.
The Golgi apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER.
It is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell.
Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell.
The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels "items" and then sends them to different parts of the cell.
