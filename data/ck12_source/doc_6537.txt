2-methylpropane is an example of a type of alkane called a branched alkane.
The IUPAC system of nomenclature for branched alkanes follows a set of steps which will be applied to the example molecule below.
Example nomenclature of a complicated branched alkene
Find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule.
This is called the parent chain.
In the example, the longest chain is eight carbon atoms and so the parent hydrocarbon is octane.
Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain.
To do this, start at the end that will give the smallest numbers possible to the carbon atoms where the branches originate.
In the example above, the branches are on carbons 3 and 5 when the chain is numbered left-to-right.
If it were to be numbered right-to-left, the branches would be on carbons 4 and 6, so the left-to-right order is preferable.
The atoms attached to the parent chain are called substituents.
A substituent that is a hydrocarbon is called an alkyl group .
The names of alkyl groups use the same prefixes as the alkanes, but with a â€“yl suffix.
So a 1-carbon alkyl group is a methyl group, a 2-carbon alkyl group is an ethyl group, and so on.
The substituents are named by placing the number from the parent carbon chain in front of the name of the substituent.
In the current example, we have 3-methyl and 4-ethyl substituents.
Use a prefix to indicate the appearance of more than one of the same substituent in the structural formula.
Two of the same group is tri-, three is tri-, four is tetra-, etc.
For example, if methyl groups were attached to both carbons 2 and 3, that part of the name would be 2, 3-dimethyl-.
This rule does not apply to the current structure above.
