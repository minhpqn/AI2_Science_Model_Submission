Transcription factors are proteins that bind to regulatory elements on the DNA and have a significant role in the regulation of gene expression .
Hence, one domain of many transcription factors is a DNA-binding domain.
Transcription factors can activate or repress gene expression.
In eukaryotic genes, transcription factors usually must bind to a gene's promoter prior to the binding of RNA polymerase and the initiation of transcription.
This ensures that a gene is only expressed when its product is needed by the cell.
See
for a brief description.
In eukaryotes, an important class of transcription factors is called general transcription factors (GTFs).
These factors are necessary for transcription to occur.
Many of these GTFs are part of the large transcription preinitiation complex that interacts with RNA polymerase directly.
The most common GTFs are those that are involved in the RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of DNA.
These include the ubiquitous TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH.
The preinitiation complex binds to promoter regions of DNA upstream to the gene that they regulate.
TFIID is also known as the TATA binding protein as it binds to the TATA box.
DNA and Protein Interactions
DNA and proteins interact with each other for various reasons.
Most of these reasons have to do with influencing the DNA structure or the expression of genes with in the DNA, a process known as gene expression.
How the protein interacts with the DNA is based on the structure of the protein.
Conserved DNA binding motifs are present among DNA binding proteins.
These include domains known as the leucine zipper, the helix-turn-helix, the zinc finger and the helix-loop helix domains.
