The strong nuclear force is transferred between quarks by fundamental force-carrying particles called gluons.
Both protons and neutrons consist of quarks.
The exchange of gluons holds quarks together within a proton or neutron.
Excess, or residual, strong force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
The strong nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force of repulsion pushing protons apart.
Both forces are represented in the Figure below .
Diagram of strong nuclear force
The types of quarks found in protons and neutrons are called up quarks (u) and down quarks (d).
Each proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark (uud), and each neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks (udd).
This diagram represents two protons.
The strong nuclear force works only over very short distances.
As a result, it isnâ€™t effective if the nucleus gets too big.
As more protons are added to the nucleus, the electromagnetic force of repulsion between them gets stronger, while the strong nuclear force of attraction between them gets weaker.
This puts an upper limit on the number of protons an atom can have and remain stable.
If atoms have more than 83 protons, the electromagnetic repulsion between them is greater than the strong nuclear force of attraction between them.
This makes the nucleus unstable, or radioactive, so it breaks down.
The following video discusses the strong nuclear force and its role in the atom.
The video also introduces the weak nuclear force, which is described next.
