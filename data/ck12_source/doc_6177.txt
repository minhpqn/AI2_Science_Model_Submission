A process is described for calculations of dilutions.

Perform calculations involving molality.
Molality is very useful when the volume of a solution changes, such as under heating
How do you measure physical parameters of solutions?
For many purposes, the use of molarity is very convenient.
However, when we want to know the concentration of solute present in situations where there are temperature changes, molarity won’t work.
The volume of the solution will change somewhat with temperature, enough to make accurate data observations and calculations in error.
Another parameter is needed, one not affected by the temperature of the material we are studying.
A final way to express the concentration of a solution is by its molality.
The molality ( m ) of a solution is the moles of solute divided by the kilograms of solvent.
A solution that contains 1.0 mol of NaCl dissolved into 1.0 kg of water is a “one-molal” solution of sodium chloride.
The symbol for molality is a lower-case m written in italics.
