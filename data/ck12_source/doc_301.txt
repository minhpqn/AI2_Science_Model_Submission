Elastic collisions are those in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.
Inelastic collisions are those in which either momentum or kinetic energy is not conserved.
The following video is a demonstration of elastic and inelastic collisions.

Explain what happened in the first demonstration on elastic collisions.
Explain what happened in the second demonstration on inelastic collisions.
Assuming the first carts started at the same speed in both demonstrations, explain using momentum why the inelastic collision ended slower than the elastic collision.
Practice problems for elastic collision:
A 4.00 kg metal cart is sitting at rest on a frictionless ice surface.  Another metal cart whose mass is 1.00 kg is fired at the cart and strikes it in a one-dimensional elastic collision.  If the original velocity of the second cart was 2.00 m/s, what are the velocities of the two carts after the collision?
Identify the following collisions as most likely elastic or most likely inelastic.
A ball of modeling clay dropped on the floor.
A fender-bender automobile collision.
A golf ball landing on the green.
Two billiard balls colliding on a billiard table.
A collision between two ball bearings.
