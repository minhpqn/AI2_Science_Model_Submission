Water is obviously an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem.
Life cannot exist without water.
Many organisms contain a large amount of water in their bodies, and many live in water, so the water cycle is essential to life on Earth.
Water continuously moves between living organisms, such as plants, and non-living things, such as clouds, rivers, and oceans ( Figure below ).
The water cycle does not have a real starting or ending point.
It is an endless recycling process that involves the oceans, lakes and other bodies of water, as well as the land surfaces and the atmosphere.
The steps in the water cycle are as follows, starting with the water in the oceans:
Water evaporates from the surface of the oceans, leaving behind salts.
As the water vapor rises, it collects and is stored in clouds.
As water cools in the clouds, condensation occurs.
Condensation is when gases turn back into liquids.
Condensation creates precipitation.
Precipitation includes rain, snow, hail, and sleet.
The precipitation allows the water to return again to the Earthâ€™s surface.
When precipitation lands on land, the water can sink into the ground to become part of our underground water reserves, also known as groundwater .
Much of this underground water is stored in aquifers , which are porous layers of rock that can hold water.
Most precipitation that occurs over land, however, is not absorbed by the soil and is called runoff .
This runoff collects in streams and rivers and eventually flows back into the ocean.
Water also moves through the living organisms in an ecosystem.
Plants soak up large amounts of water through their roots.
