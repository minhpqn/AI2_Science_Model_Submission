Find the current going through the 75\ \Omega light bulb.
Find the current going through the 50\ \Omega light bulbs (hint: it’s the same, why?).
Order the light bulbs in terms of brightness
If they were all wired in parallel, order them in terms of brightness.
Find the total current output by the power supply and the power dissipated by the 20\ \Omega resistor.
You have a 600\;\mathrm{V} power source, two 10\ \Omega toasters that both run on 100\;\mathrm{V} and a 25\ \Omega resistor.
Show me how you would wire them up so the toasters run properly.
What is the power dissipated by the toasters?
Where would you put the fuses to make sure the toasters don’t draw more than 15 Amps?
Where would you put a 25 Amp fuse to prevent a fire (if too much current flows through the wires they will heat up and possibly cause a fire)?
Look at the following scheme of four identical light bulbs connected as shown.
Answer the questions below giving a justification for your answer:
Which of the four light bulbs is the brightest?
Which light bulbs are the dimmest?
Tell in the following cases which other light bulbs go out if:
bulb A goes out
bulb B goes out
bulb D goes out
Tell in the following cases which other light bulbs get dimmer, and which get brighter if:
bulb B goes out
