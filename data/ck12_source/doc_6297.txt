Do problems 1-9 at the following link:
In an endothermic reaction, is the potential energy of the products higher or lower that the potential energy of the reactants?
In an exothermic reaction, is the potential energy of the products higher or lower that the potential energy of the reactants?
What does activation energy tell us?
potential energy diagram:
Shows the change in potential energy of a system as reactants are converted into products.
Define the activated complex.

Will it stick?
Velcro is a synthetic material that allows fabrics (among other things) to stick together.
Another more unusual use for Velcro is the sport (?) of “Velcro-jumping”.
The participant wears clothing made of Velcro and jumps at a Velcro-covered wall.
Sometimes the collision with the wall will result in the person sticking to the wall.
Other times the person simply bounces off the wall and does not connect.
Reactant particles sometimes collide with one other and yet remain unchanged by the collision.
Other times, the collision leads to the formation of products.
The state of the particles that is in between the reactants and products is called the activated complex .
An activated complex  is an unstable arrangement of atoms that exists momentarily at the peak of the activation energy barrier.
Because of its high energy, the activated complex exists for an extremely short period of time (about 10 −13 s).
