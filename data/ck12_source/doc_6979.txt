Beautiful sunsets are another manifestation of Rayleigh scattering that occurs when light travels long distances through the atmosphere.
The blue light and some green is scattered away, making the sun appear red.
Question :
In a dark room a blue light is shined on a magenta shirt what color does it appear?
How about a yellow shirt?
Answer :
Since magenta is the combination of red and blue and only blue light is available to be reflected, the shirt will appear blue.
As for the yellow shirt, there is no blue light in yellow (yellow is the combination of red and green), thus the shirt will appear black since no light is reflected off it.
