The Theory of Evolution
Evolution means change over time.
Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution says that organisms change over time ( Figure below ).
Evolution is seen in the fossil record.
It is seen in the way organisms develop.
Evolution is evident in the geographic locations where organism are found.
It is evident in the genes of living organisms.
Evolution has a mechanism called natural selection .
The organism that is best suited to its environment is most likely to survive.
Evolution is described in the chapter Life on Earth .
The theory of evolution states that modern humans evolved from ape-like ancestors
The theory of evolution maintains that modern humans evolved from ape-like ancestors.
The Theory of Plate Tectonics
Plate tectonics theory says that slabs of continents move around on Earth's surface.
The mechanism for that movement is seafloor spreading.
Plate tectonics explain many things about Earth: (1) geological activity, why it happens where it does; (2) natural resources, why many are found where they are; and (3) the past and future, what happened in the past and what will happen in the future.
The theory of plate tectonics will be explored in the chapter Plate Tectonics .
The Theory of Climate Change
The theory of climate change is very new.
In fact, scientists don't even call it a theory.
