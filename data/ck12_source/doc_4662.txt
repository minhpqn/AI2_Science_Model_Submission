To be considered an STI, an infection must have only a small chance of spreading naturally in ways other than sexual contact.
Some infections that can spread through sexual contact, such as the common cold, spread more commonly by other means.
These infections are not considered STIs.
Pathogens that Cause STIs
STIs may be caused by several different types of pathogens, including protozoa, insects, bacteria, and viruses.
For example:
Protozoa cause an STI called trichomoniasis .
The pathogen infects the vagina in females and the urethra in males, causing symptoms such as burning and itching.
Trichomoniasis is common in young people.
Pubic lice , like the one in Figure below , are insect parasites that are transmitted sexually.
They suck the blood of their host and irritate the skin in the pubic area.
Public lice like this one are only about as big as the head of a pin.
Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses.
Bacterial STIs can be cured with antibiotics.
Viral STIs cannot be cured.
Once you are infected with a viral STI, you are likely to be infected for life.
How STIs Spread
Most of the pathogens that cause STIs enter the body through mucous membranes of the reproductive organs.
All sexual behaviors that involve contact between mucous membranes put a person at risk for infection.
This includes vaginal, anal, and oral sexual behaviors.
