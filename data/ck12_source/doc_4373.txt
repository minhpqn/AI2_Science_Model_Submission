Compare and contrast the three orders of living amphibians.
Amphibian Evolution and Ecology
Describe how amphibians evolved.
State where amphibians live and how they obtain food.
Why were amphibians so successful?
They might not have had many predators on land 365 million years ago.
Given plenty of land and food, they had the resources to thrive.
This is a frog fossil from the Eocene epoch.
The vertebral column and four limbs are easily identifiable.
Evolution of Amphibians
Fossil evidence shows that amphibians evolved about 365 million years ago from a lobe-finned lungfish ancestor.
As the earliest land vertebrates, they were highly successful.
Some of them were much larger than todayâ€™s amphibians.
For more than 100 million years, amphibians remained the dominant land vertebrates.
Then some of them evolved into reptiles.
Once reptiles appeared, with their amniotic eggs, they replaced amphibians as the dominant land vertebrates.
Ecology of Amphibians
Amphibians can be found in freshwater and moist terrestrial habitats throughout the world.
The only continent without amphibians is Antarctica.
Amphibians are especially numerous in temperate lakes and ponds and in tropical rainforests.
