Members of the group may cooperate by sharing food.
They may also cooperate by defending each other.
Look at the ants pictured below ( Figure below ).
They show very clearly why cooperation is important.
A single ant would not be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants.
With cooperation, the job is easy.
Ants cooperating to move a dead insect
These ants are cooperating.
By working together, they are able to move this much larger insect prey back to their nest.
At the nest, they will share the bee with other ants that do not leave the nest.
Animals in many other species cooperate.
For example, lions live in groups called prides ( Figure below ).
All the lions in the pride cooperate, though there is still serious competition among the males.
Male lions work together to defend the other lions in the pride.
Female lions work together to hunt.
Then, they share the meat with other pride members.
Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats.
Meerkats are small mammals that live in Africa.
They also live in groups and cooperate with one another.
For example, young female meerkats act as babysitters.
