Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus.
Instead, their DNA floats around inside the cell.
Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes .
All prokaryotes are single-celled (unicellular) organisms.
Bacteria and Archaea are the only prokaryotes.
Organisms with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes .
Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes.
All multicellular organisms are eukaryotes.
Eukaryotes may also be single-celled.
Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have structures in common.
All cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and DNA.
The plasma membrane , or cell membrane, is the phospholipid layer that surrounds the cell and protects it from the outside environment.
Ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis.
The cytoplasm is all the contents of the cell inside the cell membrane, not including the nucleus.
Eukaryotic cells usually have multiple chromosomes , composed of DNA and protein.
Some eukaryotic species have just a few chromosomes, others have close to 100 or more.
These chromosomes are protected within the nucleus.
In addition to a nucleus, eukaryotic cells include other membrane-bound structures called organelles .
Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to be more specialized than prokaryotic cells.
Pictured below are the organelles of eukaryotic cells ( Figure below ), including the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and Golgi apparatus .
