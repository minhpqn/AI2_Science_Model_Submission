They include animals that live on land and in the ocean.
With well over 100,000 species, there can be a lot of shells.
What are Mollusks?
When you take a walk along a beach, what do you find there?
Sand, the ocean, lots of sunlight.
You may also find shells.
The shells you find are most likely left by organisms in the phylum Mollusca .
On the beach, you can find the shells of many different mollusks ( Figure below ), including clams, mussels, scallops, oysters, and snails.
Mollusks are invertebrates that usually have a hard shell, a mantle, and a radula.
Their glossy pearls, mother of pearl, and abalone shells are like pieces of jewelry.
Some mollusks, such as squid and octopus, do not have shells.
The beach yields a wide variety of mollusk shells
On the beach, you can find a wide variety of mollusk shells.
Features of the Mollusk
The Mollusk's body is often divided into different parts ( Figure below ):
A head with eyes or tentacles.
In most species, a muscular foot, which helps the mollusk move.
Some mollusks use the foot for burrowing into the sand, and others use it for jet-propulsion.
A mantle , or fold of the outer skin lining the shell.
The mantle often releases calcium carbonate, which creates an external shell, just like the ones you find on the beach.
