Step 2:
Solve .
amount of ethanol used: \frac{1.55 \text{ g}}{46.1 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.0336 \ \text{moles}
energy generated: 4.184 \text{ J/g}^\circ \text{C} \times 200 \text{ g} \times 55^\circ \text{C} = 46024 \text{ J} = 46.024 \text{ kJ}
molar heat of combustion: \frac{46.024 \text{ kJ}}{0.0336 \text{ moles}}=1369 \text{ kJ/mol}
Step 3:
Think about your result:
The burning of ethanol produces a significant amount of heat.
The molar heat of combustion is defined.
Calculations using the molar heat of combustion are described.
Watch the video at the link below (heat of combustion of almond) and answer the following questions:
Why was the pellet pressed?
How did the scientist guarantee that excess oxygen was present?
Why as there a several minute wait before igniting the bomb?
Write the reaction for the combustion of ethanol in oxygen?
What would be the limiting reagent in the reaction?
If you made an error in weighing the ethanol and added less than you planned on, would the heat of combustion result be higher or lower?
molar heat of combustion:
The heat released when one mole of a substance is completely burned.
