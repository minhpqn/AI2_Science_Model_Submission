Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way.
The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons.
Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode.
The electrodes extend out of the battery for the attachment of wires that carry the current.
The current can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device.

Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy.
Solar cells are also called photovoltaic (PV) cells because they use light ( photo- ) to produce voltage ( -voltaic ).
Solar cells contain a material such as silicon that absorbs light energy.
The energy knocks electrons loose so they can flow freely and produce a difference in electric potential energy, or voltage.
The flow of electrons creates electric current.
Solar cells have positive and negative contacts, like the terminals in chemical cells.
If the contacts are connected with wire, current flows from the negative to positive contact.
The Figure below and following URL show how a solar cell works.
Solar power cell
Current requires a source of voltage, which is a difference in electric potential energy.
Sources of voltage include chemical cells and solar cells.
Chemical cells are found in batteries.
They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions.
They contain electrodes and an electrolyte, which may be a paste (dry cell) or a liquid (wet cell).
