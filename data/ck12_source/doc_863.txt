Ecological succession is the constant replacement of one community by another.
It happens after a big change in the ecosystem.
And, of course, succession occurs on brand new land.
Primary succession is the type of ecological succession that happens on new landsâ€”lands where life has not yet existed.
Primary succession can take place after lava flow cools and hardens into new land, or a glacier recedes exposing new land.
Since the land that results from these processes is completely new land, soil must first be produced.
How is soil produced?
Primary succession always starts with a pioneer species .
This is the species that first lives in the habitat.
If life is to begin on barren rock, which is typical of new land, the pioneer species would be an organism such as a lichen ( Figure below ).
A lichen is actually an organism formed from two species.
It results from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria.
The lichen is able to thrive as both the fungus and the algae or bacteria contribute to the relationship.
The fungus is able to absorb minerals and nutrients from the rock, while algae supplies the fungus with sugars through photosynthesis .
Since lichens can photosynthesize and do not rely on soil, they can live in environments where other organisms cannot.
As a lichen grows, it breaks down the rock, which is the first step of soil formation.
Lichen are often the first step in primary succession
Primary succession on a rock often begins with the growth of lichens.
What do lichens help create?
The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations.
