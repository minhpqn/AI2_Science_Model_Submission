State the relationship between protons and elements.
Identify particles that make up protons.
This glowing sphere represents the sun, which has a diameter of 1.4 × 10 9 meters.
The sun has a special relationship to another object that is only about 1.7 × 10 -17 meters in diameter—the subatomic particle called the proton.
How is the gigantic sun related to the extremely tiny proton?
Read on to find out.
What Is a Proton?
A proton is one of three main particles that make up the atom.
The other two particles are the neutron and electron.
Protons are found in the nucleus of the atom.
This is a tiny, dense region at the center of the atom.
Protons have a positive electrical charge of one (+1) and a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 1.67 × 10 -27 kilograms.
Together with neutrons, they make up virtually all of the mass of an atom.

Q:
How do you think the sun is related to protons?
A:
The sun’s tremendous energy is the result of proton interactions.
In the sun, as well as in other stars, protons from hydrogen atoms combine, or fuse, to form nuclei of helium atoms.
