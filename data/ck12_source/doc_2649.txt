Iron bromide (FeBr 3 )
Solid ionic compounds are poor conductors of electricity.
The strong bonds between their oppositely charged ions lock them into place in the crystal.
Therefore, the charged particles cannot move freely and carry electric current, which is a flow of charge.
But all that changes when ionic compounds dissolve in water.
When they dissolve, they separate into individual ions.
The ions can move freely, so they can carry current.
Dissolved ionic compounds are called electrolytes.
The rigid crystals of ionic compounds are brittle.
They are more likely to break than bend when struck.
As a result, ionic crystals tend to shatter easily.
Try striking salt crystals with a hammer and youâ€™ll find that they readily break into smaller pieces.
