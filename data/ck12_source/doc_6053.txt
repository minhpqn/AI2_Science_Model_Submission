What device is used to measure vapor pressure?
Does the surface area of the liquid affect the vapor pressure?
Define vapor pressure.
How do intermolecular forces affect vapor pressure?
How does temperature affect vapor pressure?
liquid phase:
A substance in the liquid state of matter.
vapor phase:
A substance in the gaseous state of matter.
vapor pressure:
A measure of the force exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container.
Define boiling point.
Describe the effect of altitude on boiling point.
The boiling point of water is 30 degrees lower at Mount Everest
Why is it harder to breathe at the top of Mount Everest than at the bottom?
At 29,029 feet (8,848 m), Mount Everest in the Himalayan range on the border between China and Nepal is the highest point on the earth.
Its altitude presents many practical problems to climbers.
The oxygen content of the air is much lower than at sea level, making it necessary to bring oxygen tanks along (although a few climbers have reached the peak without oxygen).
One other problem is that of boiling water for cooking food.
Although water boils at 100°C at sea level, the boiling point on top of Mount Everest is only about 70°C.
