A reaction is also considered to be a decomposition reaction even when one or more of the products are still compounds.
A metal carbonate decomposes into a metal oxide and carbon dioxide gas.
For example, calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.
\text{CaCO}_3(s) \rightarrow \text{CaO}(s)+\text{CO}_2(g)
Metal hydroxides decompose on heating to yield metal oxides and water.
Sodium hydroxide decomposes to produce sodium oxide and water.
2\text{NaOH}(s) \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{O}(s)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
Some unstable acids decompose to produce nonmetal oxides and water.
Carbonic acid decomposes easily at room temperature into carbon dioxide and water.
\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3(aq) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
