How is active immunity different from passive immunity?
Why does active immunity last longer?
Explain how immunization prevents a disease such as measles, which is caused by a virus.
Identify common allergens.
Have you ever started to sneeze and not known why?
A beautiful sea of flowers.
A nice sight, unless you have an allergic reaction.
It is not uncommon to have reactions to pollen.
Your immune system usually protects you from pathogens and keeps you well.
However, like any other body system, the immune system itself can develop problems.
Sometimes it responds to harmless foreign substances as though they were pathogens.
Sometimes it attacks the bodyâ€™s own cells.
Certain diseases can also attack and damage the immune system and interfere with its ability to defend the body.
An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen .
Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen.
Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin.
Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below .
Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing.
Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash.
Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications.
