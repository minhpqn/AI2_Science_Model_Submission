That’s because everything around you consists of matter and energy.
Several examples of matter and energy interacting are pictured in the Figure below .
Read how physics explains each example.

Examples of how matter and energy interact.
Q:
Based on the examples in Figure above , what might be other examples of energy and matter interacting?
A:
Like the strings of cello, anything that vibrates produces waves of energy that travel through matter.
For example, when you throw a pebble into a pond, waves of energy travel from the pebble through the water in all directions.
Like an incandescent light bulb, anything that glows consists of matter that produces light energy.
For example, fireflies use chemicals to produce light energy.
Like a moving tennis racket, anything that moves has energy because it is moving, including your eyes as they read this sentence.
Physics is the study of energy, matter, and their interactions.
It is concerned with matter and energy at all levels—from the most fundamental particles of matter to the entire universe.
Physics can help you understand just about everything in the world around you.
That’s because everything around you is matter and has energy.
