Aborigines, the native people of Australia, play an instrument called the Didgeridoo like the one shown above.
The Didgeridoo produces a low pitch sound and is possibly the worldâ€™s oldest instrument.
The one shown above is about 1.3 m long and open at both ends.
Knowing that when a tube is open at both ends there must be an antinode at both ends, draw the first 3 harmonics for this instrument.
Calculate the frequency of the first 3 harmonics assuming room temperature and thus a velocity of sound of 340 m/s.
Then take a shot at deriving a generic formula for the frequency of the n th standing wave mode for the Didgeridoo, as was done for the string tied at both ends and for the tube open at one end.
Students are doing an experiment to determine the speed of sound in air.
They hold a tuning fork above a large empty graduated cylinder and try to create resonance.
The air column in the graduated cylinder can be adjusted by putting water in it.
At a certain point for each tuning fork a clear resonance point is heard.
The students adjust the water finely to get the peak resonance then carefully measure the air column from water to top of air column. (The assumption is that the tuning fork itself creates an anti-node and the water creates a node.) The following data were collected:
Frequency of tuning fork (Hz)
Length of air column (cm)
Speed of sound (m/s)
(a) Fill out the last two columns in the data table.
(b) Explain major inconsistencies in the data or results.
(c) The graduated cylinder is 50 cm high.
