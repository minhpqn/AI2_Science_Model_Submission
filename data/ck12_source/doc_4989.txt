What is energy?
Describe two ways that energy changes form in the following sequence of events:
A plant grows in the sun. â†’ A rabbit eats the plant.
Describe a real-life situation in which the energy of an object or person changes back and forth between kinetic energy and potential energy.
Identify each time energy changes form.
States of Matter in Biological Systems - Advanced
Identify three states of matter and explain how they differ.
Solid, liquid or gas?
The state of matter is a physical property of that matter.
H 2 O can exist in three different states of matter.
This glacier is obviously a solid state of H 2 O, floating in the liquid state.
Why does the ice float on water?
Which has a greater density, solid H 2 O or liquid H 2 O?
States of Matter
The amount of energy in molecules of matter determines the state of matter .
Matter can exist in one of several different states, including a gas, liquid, or solid state.
These different states of matter have different properties, which are illustrated in Figure below .
Gasses have the most energy, and solids have the least energy.
A gas is a state of matter in which atoms or molecules have enough energy to move freely.
The molecules come into contact with one another only when they randomly collide.
