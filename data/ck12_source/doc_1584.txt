Before catalytic converters were required, cars spewed a lot of pollutants into the air.
On the left is a car without a catalytic converter.
The car on the right has one.
Increasing Alternative Energy Sources
Developing alternative energy sources is important.
What are some of the problems facing wider adoption of alternative energy sources?
The technologies are still being developed.
This includes sources of alternative energy, like solar and wind.
Solar and wind are still expensive relative to fossil fuels.
The technology needs to advance so that the price falls.
Some areas get low amounts of sunlight and are not suited for solar.
Others do not have much wind.
It is important that regions develop what best suits them.
The desert Southwest will need to develop solar.
The Great Plains can use wind energy.
Perhaps some locations will rely on nuclear power.
