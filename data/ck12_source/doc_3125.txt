What Are Nonrenewable Resources?
Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up.
A natural resource is anything people can use that comes from nature.
Energy resources are some of the most important natural resources because everything we do requires energy.
Nonrenewable energy resources include fossil fuels such as oil and the radioactive element uranium.
Types of Fossil Fuels
Oil, or petroleum, is one of several fossil fuels .
Fossil fuels are mixtures of hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon) that formed over millions of years from the remains of dead organisms.
In addition to oil, they include coal and natural gas.
Fossil fuels provide most of the energy used in the world today.
They are burned in power plants to produce electrical energy, and they also fuel cars, heat homes, and supply energy for many other purposes.
You can see some ways they are used in the Figure below .
