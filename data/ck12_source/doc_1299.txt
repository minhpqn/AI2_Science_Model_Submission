Draw a picture to show how compressive stresses lead to folds.
Can these stresses create anticlines and synclines?
Do you think that anticlines and synclines are ordinarily found separately or next to each other?
Describe domes and basins.
Where are the youngest rocks in each?
Describe joints and faults.
Identify types of faults.
