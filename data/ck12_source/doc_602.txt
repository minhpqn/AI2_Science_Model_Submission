On the other hand, some people with gonorrhea have no symptoms.
As a result, they don’t seek treatment.
Without treatment, gonorrhea may lead to infection of other reproductive organs.
This can happen in males as well as females.
Syphilis is a very serious STI.
Luckily, it is less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea.
Syphilis usually begins with a small sore on the genitals.
This is followed a few months later by a rash and flu-like symptoms.
If syphilis is not treated, it may damage the heart, brain, and other organs.
It can even cause death.
Genital warts are an STI caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV .
They are one of the most common STIs in teenagers.
HPV infections cannot be cured.
But a new vaccine called Gardasil® can prevent most HPV infections in females.
Many doctors recommend that females between the ages of 9 and 26 years receive the vaccine.
Preventing HPV infections in females is important because HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix.
A related herpes virus causes cold sores on the lips ( Figure below ).
Both viruses cause painful blisters.
In the case of genital herpes , the blisters are on the penis or around the vaginal opening.
The blisters go away on their own, but the virus remains in the body.
