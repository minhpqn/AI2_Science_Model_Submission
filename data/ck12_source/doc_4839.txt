In photosynthesis, cells use the energy in sunlight to change water and carbon dioxide into glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and oxygen (O 2 ).
This is an anabolic reaction, represented by the chemical equation:
6 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O + energy → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 O 2 .
In cellular respiration, cells break down glucose in the presence of oxygen and release energy, water, and carbon dioxide.
This is a catabolic reaction, represented by the chemical equation:
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 O 2 → 6 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O + energy
Two other types of reactions that occur in organisms and involve water are dehydration and hydration reactions.
A dehydration reaction occurs when molecules combine to form a single, larger molecule and also a molecule of water. (If some other small molecule is formed instead of water, the reaction is called by the more general term, condensation reaction .) It is a type of anabolic reaction.
An example of a dehydration reaction is the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids in a polypeptide chain.
When two amino acids bond together, a molecule of water is lost.
This is shown in Figure below .
In this dehydration reaction, two amino acids form a peptide bond.
A water molecule also forms.
A hydration reaction is the opposite of a dehydration reaction.
A hydration reaction adds water to an organic molecule and breaks the large molecule into smaller molecules.
Hydration reactions occur in an acidic water solution.
An example of hydration reaction is the breaking of peptide bonds in polypeptides.
A hydroxide ion (OH - ) and a hydrogen ion (H + ) (both from a water molecule) bond to the carbon atoms that formed the peptide bond.
This breaks the peptide bond and results in two amino acids.
Water is essential for all of these important chemical reactions in organisms.
