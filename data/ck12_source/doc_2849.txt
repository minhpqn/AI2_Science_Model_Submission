Your answer should include the role of nuclear forces in the reaction.
What is nuclear fission?
Outline how nuclear fission occurs.
Describe a nuclear chain reaction.
How is nuclear fission controlled in a nuclear power plant?
Compare and contrast the use of fossil fuels and nuclear fission to produce energy.
Describe how and where nuclear fusion occurs.
Outline the pros and cons of using nuclear fusion to produce energy.
What causes the sun to glow so brightly?
The answer is nuclear fusion.
Nuclear fusion is a type of nuclear reaction, and it releases a huge amount of energy.
What Is Nuclear Fusion?
In nuclear fusion , two or more small nuclei combine to form a single, larger nucleus.
You can see an example in the Figure below .
In this example, nuclei of two hydrogen isotopes (tritium and deuterium) fuse to form a helium nucleus.
A neutron and a tremendous amount of energy are also released.

The Power of Stars
Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium occurs naturally in the sun and other stars.
It takes place only at extremely high temperatures.
