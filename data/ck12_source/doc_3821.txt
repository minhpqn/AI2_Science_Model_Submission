Remember that individuals do not evolve.
Their genes do not change over time.
The unit of evolution is the population.
A population consists of organisms of the same species that live in the same area.
In terms of evolution, the population is assumed to be a relatively closed group.
This means that most mating takes place within the population.
The science that focuses on evolution within populations is population genetics .
It is a combination of evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics.
The genetic makeup of an individual is the individual’s genotype .
A population consists of many genotypes.
Altogether, they make up the population’s gene pool.
The gene pool consists of all the genes of all the members of the population.
For each gene, the gene pool includes all the different alleles for the gene that exist in the population.
For a given gene, the population is characterized by the frequency of the different alleles in the gene pool.
Allele frequency is how often an allele occurs in a gene pool relative to the other alleles for that gene.
Look at the example in the Table below .
The population in the table has 100 members.
In a sexually reproducing species, each member of the population has two copies of each gene.
Therefore, the total number of copies of each gene in the gene pool is 200.
The gene in the example exists in the gene pool in two forms, alleles A and a .
