What did the ancient Greeks recognize as the Universe?
Their Universe had Earth at the center, the Sun, the Moon, five planets, and a sphere to which all the stars were attached.
This idea held for many centuries.
Galileo and his telescope helped people recognize that Earth is not the center of the Universe.
They also found out that there are many more stars than were visible to the naked eye.
All of those stars were in the Milky Way Galaxy.
In the early 20th century, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble ( Figure below ) discovered something amazing.
He showed that the Andromeda Nebula was over 2 million light years away.
This was many times farther than the farthest distances that had ever been measured.
Hubble realized that many of the objects that astronomers called nebulas were not actually clouds of gas.
They were collections of millions or billions of stars.
We now call these features galaxies.
Edwin Hubble was able to use the Mount Wilson Observatory telescope to demonstrate the existence of galaxies
(a) Edwin Hubble used the 100-inch reflecting telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California to show that some distant specks of light were galaxies. (b) Hubbleâ€™s namesake space telescope spotted this six galaxy group.
Edwin Hubble demonstrated the existence of galaxies.
Hubble showed that the Universe was much larger than our own galaxy.
Today, we know that the Universe contains about a hundred billion galaxies.
This is about the same number of galaxies as there are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.
The Universe contains about a hundred billion galaxies.
The idea of a Universe has changed through human history.
