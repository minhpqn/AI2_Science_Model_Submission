What are the products of the Krebs cycle?
Explain why two turns of the Krebs cycle are needed for each molecule of glucose.
Summarize the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
Identify the products of the Krebs cycle.
Explain the necessity of oxygen for the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
Describe a chemiosmotic gradient.
Explain the synthesis of ATP.
Train, truck, boat or plane?
Ways to transport.
To make ATP, energy must be ‘‘transported’’ - first from glucose to NADH, and then somehow passed to ATP.
How is this done?
With an electron transport chain.
Cellular Respiration Stage III:
Electron Transport
Electron transport is the final stage of aerobic respiration.
In this stage, energy from NADH and FADH 2 , which result from the Krebs cycle, is transferred to ATP.
Can you predict how this happens? ( Hint:
How does electron transport occur in photosynthesis?)
See  for an overview of the electron transport chain.
High-energy electrons are released from NADH and FADH 2 , and they move along electron transport chains , like those used in photosynthesis.
