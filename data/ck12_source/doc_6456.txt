What is the oxidation number of H in HCl? in NaH?
oxidation number:
A positive or negative number that is assigned to an atom to indicate its degree of oxidation or reduction.
Changes in Oxidation Number in Redox Reactions
List processes of oxidation and reduction.
Determine which atoms in a chemical reaction have been oxidized or reduced.
Zinc is an important component of many kinds of batteries
Where does the zinc in batteries come from?
Zinc is an important component of many kinds of batteries.
This metal is mined as zinc compounds, one of which is zinc carbonate.
To obtain the pure metal, the ore must go through the following chemical processes:
High temperatures and hot air blasts are used to roast the ore:
\text{ZnCO}_3(s) + (\text{heat}) \rightarrow \text{ZnO}(s) + \text{CO}_2(g)
Then the ZnO is treated with carbon:
\text{ZnO}(s) +\text{C}(s) + (\text{heat}) & \rightarrow \text{Zn}(g) + \text{CO}(g)\\\text{ZnO}(s)+\text{CO}(g)+ (\text{heat}) & \rightarrow \text{Zn}(g)+\text{CO}_2(g)
The result is the pure metal which can then be fabricated into a variety of products.
Changes in Oxidation-Number in Redox Reactions
Consider the reaction below between elemental iron and copper sulfate:
\text{Fe} + \text{CuSO}_4 \rightarrow \text{FeSO}_4 + \text{Cu}
In the course of the reaction, the oxidation number of Fe increases from zero to +2.
