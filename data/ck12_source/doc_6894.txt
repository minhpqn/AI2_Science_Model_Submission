Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators.
For instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces).
The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass.
In this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple harmonic motion.
The speed of a wave on a string depends on the material the string is made of, as well as the tension in the string.
This fact is why tightening a string on your violin or guitar will increase the frequency, or pitch, of the sound it produces.
Reread the difference between transverse and longitudinal waves.
For each of the following types of waves, tell what type it is and why. (Include a sketch for each.)
water waves in the wake of a boat
a vibrating string on a guitar
a swinging jump rope
the vibrating surface of a drum
the “wave” done by spectators at a sports event
slowly moving traffic jams
A mass is oscillating up and down on a spring.
Below is a graph of its vertical position as a function of time.
What is the amplitude at t = 32 seconds?
At what times is the mass momentarily at rest?
How do you know?
Velocity is defined as change in position over time.
