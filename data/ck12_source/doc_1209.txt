Texture indicates how the magma cooled.
Magma that cools rapidly has small or no visible crystals.
Magma that cools slowly has large crystals; reference the Table above for the type of rock, the amount of silica it has, and examples.
Comparison between rhyolite and granite
Is this an intrusive or an extrusive igneous rock?
Comparison between basalt and gabbro
Is this an intrusive or an extrusive igneous rock?
Pictured above are two pairs of igneous rocks ( Figures above and above ).
The first pair is two rocks that formed from a felsic magma.
The rhyolite cooled rapidly, and the granite cooled slowly.
The second pair is two rocks that formed from mafic magma.
The basalt cooled rapidly, and the gabbro cooled slowly.
The color of the rocks and sizes of the crystals are your clues.
There are other rock pairs that you could find listed below ( Table below ).
Amount of Silica
>69% SiO 2
Igneous rocks are classified first by composition.
Categories go from from felsic to ultramafic.
Color can indicate composition.
Texture is second when classifying igneous rocks.
