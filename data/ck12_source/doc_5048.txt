Water is split.
Explain the value of cycles of chemical reactions, such as the Calvin Cycle.
Define carbon fixation.
Explain how their various methods of carbon fixation adapt C-3, C-4, and CAM plants to different habitats.
Chemosynthesis - Advanced
Define chemosynthesis and describe chemosynthetic organisms.
Is it possible to live in temperatures over 175°F?
It is if you're a Pompeii worm.
The Pompeii worm, the most heat-tolerant animal on Earth, lives in the deep ocean at super-heated hydrothermal vents.
Covering this deep-sea worm's back is a fleece of bacteria.
These microbes contain all the genes necessary for life in extreme environments.
Why do bacteria that live deep below the ocean’s surface rely on chemical compounds instead of sunlight for energy to make food?
Most autotrophs make food by photosynthesis, but this isn’t the only way that autotrophs produce food.
Some bacteria make food by another process, which uses chemical energy instead of light energy.
This process is called chemosynthesis .
In chemosynthesis, one or more carbon molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane, CH 4 ) and nutrients is converted into organic matter, using the oxidation of inorganic molecules, such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) or ammonia (NH 3 ) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight.
In hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis, in the presence of carbon dioxide and oxygen, carbohydrates (CH 2 O) can be produced:
CO 2 + O 2 + 4H 2 S → CH 2 O + 4S + 3H 2 O
Many organisms that use chemosynthesis are extremophile members of the kingdom Archaea.
These prokaryotes live in harsh conditions such as in the absence of sunlight, and in a wide range of water temperatures, some approaching the boiling point.
