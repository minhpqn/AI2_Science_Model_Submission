Rockets also work in this manner.
It is a misconception that the rocket moves forward because the escaping gas pushes on the ground or the surrounding air to make the rocket go forward.
Rockets work in outer space where there is no ground or surrounding air.
The rocket exerts a force on the gases causing them to be expelled and the gases exert a force on the rocket causing it to be accelerated forward.
A force applied to an object is always applied by another object.
Newton’s Third Law of Motion states, “Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object also exerts a force on the first object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.”
The following video contains a discussion and an example of Newton’s Third Law of Motion.

What does the bottle rocket have to do with Newton’s Third Law of Motion?
What is wrong with the following statement:
When you exert a force on a baseball, the equal and opposite force on the ball balances the original force and therefore, the ball will not accelerate in any direction.
When a bat strikes a ball, the force exerted can send the ball deep into the outfield.
Where is the equal and opposite force in this case?
Suppose you wish to jump horizontally and in order for you to jump a distance of 4 feet horizontally, you must exert a force of 200 N.
When you are standing on the ground, you have no trouble jumping 4 feet horizontally.
If you are standing in a canoe, however, and you need to jump 4 feet to reach the pier, you will surely fall into the lake.
Why is it that you cannot jump 4 feet out of a canoe when you can easily do this when on land?
Newton's Third Law of Motion:
Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object also exerts a force on the first object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
