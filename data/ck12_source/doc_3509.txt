Can molecules enter and leave the cell?
Yes.
Can anything or everything enter or leave?
No.
So, what determines what can go in or out?
Is it the nucleus?
The DNA?
Or the plasma membrane?
The Plasma Membrane
The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane ) forms a barrier between the cytoplasm inside the cell and the environment outside the cell.
It protects and supports the cell and also controls everything that enters and leaves the cell.
It allows only certain substances to pass through, while keeping others in or out.
