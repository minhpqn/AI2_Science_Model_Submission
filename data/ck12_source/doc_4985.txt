In fact, matter is the “stuff” of which all organisms are made.
Anything that occupies space and has mass is known as matter.
Matter, in turn, consists of chemical substances.
It is the carbons, hydrogens, oxygens and other elements that combine to form molecules, compounds, organelles, cells and eventually tissues, organs and organisms.
In addition to being made of matter, all living organisms also need energy to survive.
Energy is a property of matter that is defined as the ability to do work.
The concept of energy is useful for explaining and predicting most natural phenomena, and it is the foundation for an understanding of biology.
All living organisms need energy to grow and reproduce.
However, energy can never be created nor destroyed.
Energy can only be transformed.
That is, energy is always conserved.
This is called the law of conservation of energy .
Therefore, organisms cannot create the energy they need.
Instead, they must obtain energy from the environment.
Organisms also cannot destroy or use up the energy they obtain.
They can only change it from one form to another.
Organisms will either use their energy (for metabolism) or release it to the environment as heat.
In biology, energy is required for ecosystems to survive, as all living organisms need energy.
Within an organism, energy is needed for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle within that cell.
Energy is also needed for all biochemical reactions within that cell.
