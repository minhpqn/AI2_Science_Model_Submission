Is NO formation spontaneous at room temperature?
How do we know that the equilibrium between carbonic acid and CO 2 goes strongly to the right?
nonspontaneous reaction:
A reaction that does not favor the formation of products at the given set of conditions.
spontaneous reaction:  A reaction that favors the formation of products at the conditions under which the reaction is occurring.
Define free energy.
Describe how changes in  \Delta H and  \Delta S affect \Delta G .
A steam train converts free energy into mechanical energy
The steam engine pictured above is slowly going out of style, but is still a picturesque part of the modern railroad.
The water in a boiler is heated by a fire (usually fueled by coal) and turned to steam.
This steam then pushes the pistons that drive the wheels of the train.
It is the pressure created by the steam which allows work to be done in moving the train.
Many chemical reactions and physical processes release energy that can be used to do other things.
When the fuel in a car is burned, some of the released energy is used to power the vehicle.
Free energy is energy that is available to do work.
Spontaneous reactions release free energy as they proceed.
Recall that the determining factors for spontaneity of a reaction are the enthalpy and entropy changes that occur for the system.
The free energy change of a reaction is a mathematical combination of the enthalpy change and the entropy change.
\Delta G^\circ=\Delta H^\circ - T \Delta S^\circ
The symbol for free energy is G , in honor of American scientist Josiah Gibbs (1839-1903), who made many contributions to thermodynamics.
