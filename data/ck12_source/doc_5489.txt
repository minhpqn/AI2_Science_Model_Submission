Drought can destroy crop yields, as can too much rain or floods.
But what if crops could be developed to withstand these harsh conditions?
Biotechnology will allow the development of crops containing genes that will enable them to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses.
For example, drought and excessively salty soil are two significant factors affecting crop productivity.
But there are crops that can withstand these harsh conditions.
Why?
Probably because of that plant's genetics.
So biotechnologists and plant geneticists are studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions, trying to identify and isolate the genes that control these beneficial traits.
The genes could then be transferred into more desirable crops, with the hope of producing the same phenotypes in those crops.
Thale cress ( Figure below ), a species of Arabidopsis ( A. thaliana ), is a tiny weed that is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow and its genome has been extensively characterized.
Scientists have identified a gene from this plant, At-DBF2, that confers resistance to some environmental stresses.
When this gene is inserted into tomato and tobacco cells, the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses like salt, drought, cold and heat far better than ordinary cells.
If these preliminary results prove successful in larger trials, then At-DBF2 genes could help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments.
Researchers have also created transgenic rice plants that are resistant to rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV).
In Africa, this virus destroys much of the rice crops and makes the surviving plants more susceptible to fungal infections.
Increased Nutritional Qualities of Crops
Maybe youâ€™ve heard over and over that eating beans is good for you.
True?
Well, maybe.
But what if it were genetically possible to increase the nutritional qualities of food?
