The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass.
So the cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way.
As the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses.
Clouds form, and precipitation falls.
If the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy.
Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds.
Winds may be very strong along a cold front.
Diagram of a cold front
Cold fronts often bring stormy weather.
As the fast-moving cold air mass keeps advancing, so does the cold front.
Cold fronts often bring sudden changes in the weather.
There may be a thin line of storms right at the front that moves as it moves.
In the spring and summer, the storms may be thunderstorms and tornadoes.
In the late fall and winter, the storms may bring snow.
After a cold front passes, the cold air mass behind it brings cooler temperatures.
The air is likely to be less humid as well.
Can you explain why?
When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass, it creates a warm front ( Figure below ).
The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass.
The warm air mass then flows up over the cold air mass.
