A polymer is a large molecule that consists of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers.
The monomers are joined together by covalent bonds.
Starches contain hundreds of glucose monomers.
Plants make starches to store extra glucose.
Consumers get starches by eating plants.
Common sources of starches in the human diet are pictured in the Figure below .
Our digestive system breaks down starches to sugar, which our cells use for energy.
Examples of starches
Foods that are good sources of starches.
Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose.
However, glucose molecules are bonded together differently in cellulose than they are in starches.
Cellulose molecules bundle together to form long, tough fibers, as you can see in the Figure below .
Have you ever eaten raw celery?
If you have, then you probably noticed that the stalks contain long, stringy fibers.
The fibers are mostly cellulose.
Cellulose is the most abundant biochemical compound.
It makes up the cell walls of plants and gives support to stems and tree trunks.
Cellulose also provides needed fiber in the human diet.
We canâ€™t digest cellulose, but it helps keep food wastes moving through the digestive tract.
