\frac{178.2 \ \text{days}}{59.4 \ \text{days}/ \text{half-life}} = 3 \ \text{half-lives}
Then we simply count activity:
\text{initial activity}\ (t_0) &= 32,000 \ \text{cpm} \\\text{after one half-life} &= 16,000 \ \text{cpm} \\\text{after two half-lives} &= 8,000 \ \text{cpm} \\\text{after three half-lives} &= 4,000 \ \text{cpm}
Be sure to keep in mind that the initial count is at time zero  (t_0) and we subtract from that count at the first half-life.
The second half-life has an activity of half the previous count (not the initial count).
For the more mathematically inclined, the following formula can be used to calculate the amount of radioactivity remaining after a given time:
N_t = N_0 \times (0.5)^{\text{number of half-lives}}
where N_t = \text{activity at time} \ t
N_0 = \text{initial activity at time} = 0
If we have an initial activity of 42,000 cpm, what will the activity be after four half-lives?
N_t &=N_0(0.5)^4 \\&=(42,000)(0.5)(0.5)(0.5)(0.5) \\&=2625 \ \text{cpm}
Graph of a typical radioactive decay curve
Typical radioactive decay curve.
The graph above illustrates a typical decay curve for a radioactive material.
The activity decreases by one-half during each succeeding half-life.
Half-lives of different elements vary considerably, as shown in Table below :
2.1 million years
We have talked about the activity and decay of individual isotopes.
In the real world, there is a decay chain that takes place until a stable end-product is produced.
For U-238, the chain is a long one, with a mix of isotopes having very different half-lives.
