These glacial erratics , like the one pictured below ( Figure below ), are noticeable because they are huge.
Also, they are usually a different rock type from the surrounding bedrock.
These glacial erratics at Yosemite National Park was deposited by a glacier
These glacial erratics at Yosemite National Park was deposited by a glacier.
The material dropped by a glacier is usually a mixture of particles and rocks of all sizes.
This unsorted pile is called glacial till .
Water from the melting ice may form lakes or other water features.
The Figure below shows some of the landforms glaciers deposit when they melt.
A moraine is sediment deposited by a glacier.
A ground moraine is a thick layer of sediments left behind by a retreating glacier.
An end moraine is a low ridge of sediments deposited at the end of the glacier.
It marks the greatest distance the glacier advanced.

What erosional feature is the hikers looking at?
A drumlin is a long, low hill of sediments deposited by a glacier.
Drumlins often occur in groups called drumlin fields.
The narrow end of each drumlin points in the direction the glacier was moving when it dropped the sediments.
An esker is a winding ridge of sand deposited by a stream of meltwater.
Such streams flow underneath a retreating glacier.
