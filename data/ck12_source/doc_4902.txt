the intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes),
the inner mitochondrial membrane,
the cristae space (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane), and
the matrix (space within the inner membrane).
The outer membrane contains large numbers of integral proteins called porins .
These porins form channels that allow small molecules to freely diffuse across the membrane to the other.
The inner mitochondrial membrane is highly impermeable to all molecules.
Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix.
ATP synthase , which produces ATP in the matrix, is embedded within this membrane.
The cristae greatly expand the surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane, enhancing the ability of the mitochondria to produce ATP.
The matrix contains a highly-concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes, the mitochondrial ribosomes, tRNAs, and several copies of the mitochondrial genome.
Of the enzymes, the Krebs cycle enzymes are located here.
Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, mitochondria have their own DNA.
Mitochondria also have the machinery to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins.
The human mitochondrial DNA sequence has 16,569 base pairs encoding 37 total genes: 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 13 peptide genes.
The 13 mitochondrial peptides in humans are integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane, along with proteins encoded by nuclear genes.
Mitochondria are able to reproduce asexually, like bacteria, and scientists think that they are descended from prokaryotic organisms.
According to the Theory of Endosymbiosis , mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes that infected other prokaryotic cells.
The invading prokaryotes were protected inside the host cell, and in turn the prokaryote supplied extra ATP to its host.
Eventually these two cells turned into one eukaryotic cell, as the two organisms evolved so that they could no longer live without each other.
