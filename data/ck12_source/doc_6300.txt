A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk.
In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid.
In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.
Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction.
When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster.
This results in a greater frequency of collisions.
A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products.
Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.
Factors affecting reaction rate are:
concentration of reactants
pressure (if gas)
