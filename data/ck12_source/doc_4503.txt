You put on the brakes, steer away from the child, and yell out a warning, all in just a split second.
How do you respond so quickly?
Such rapid responses are controlled by your nervous system.
The nervous system is a complex network of nervous tissue that carries electrical messages throughout the body.
It includes the brain and spinal cord, the central nervous system , and nerves that run throughout the body, the peripheral nervous system (see Figure below ).
To understand how nervous messages can travel so quickly, you need to know more about nerve cells.
Nervous system in body
The human nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and nerves that run throughout the body (peripheral nervous system).
Although the nervous system is very complex, nervous tissue consists of just two basic types of nerve cells: neurons and glial cells.
Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system.
They transmit electrical signals, called nerve impulses.
Glial cells provide support for neurons.
For example, they provide neurons with nutrients and other materials.
As shown in Figure below , a neuron consists of three basic parts: the cell body, dendrites, and axon.
You can watch an animation of the parts of a neuron at this link:
The cell body contains the nucleus and other cell organelles.
Dendrites extend from the cell body and receive nerve impulses from other neurons.
The axon is a long extension of the cell body that transmits nerve impulses to other cells.
The axon branches at the end, forming axon terminals .
These are the points where the neuron communicates with other cells.
