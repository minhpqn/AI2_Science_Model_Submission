Who is accelerating?
Explain.
Who is going fastest at  t = 0.3 \;\mathrm{s} ?
Explain.
Which car has a constant velocity throughout?
Explain.
Graph x vs. t and v vs. t .
Put both cars on same graph; label which line is which car.
Which car is going faster at t = 0.2 \;\mathrm{s} (Hint:
Assume they travel the same distance between 0.1 and 0.2 seconds)?
a. 49 m b. 2 m/s, 4 m/s, 14 m/s
discuss in class

Graph motion vs. time and relate the slope to the instantaneous velocity or acceleration for position or velocity graphs, respectively.
Use the area of a velocity vs. time graph in order to calculate the displacement.
Students will learn how to graph motion vs time.
Specifically students will learn how to take the slope of a graph and relate that to the instantaneous velocity or acceleration for position or velocity graphs, respectively.
Finally students will learn how to take the area of a velocity vs time graph in order to calculate the displacement.
For a graph of position vs. time.
The slope is the rise over the run, where the rise is the displacement and the run is the time. thus,
