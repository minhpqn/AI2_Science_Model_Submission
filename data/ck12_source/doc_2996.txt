For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area.
You can simulate the effect of air resistance on acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL:
Q :
If a leaf and an acorn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air (that is, in a vacuum), how would this affect their acceleration due to gravity?
A :
They would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time.
When gravity pulls objects toward the ground, it always causes them to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s 2 .
Regardless of differences in mass, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity unless air resistance affects one more than another.
Watch the video at the following URL.
Based on the teens interviewed in the video, identify two common misconceptions about gravity, mass, and acceleration due to gravity.
Then explain why each misconception is false.

Describe projectile motion and state when it occurs.
Give examples of projectile motion.
The archer in the opening image is aiming his arrow a little bit above the bull’s eye of the target, rather than directly at it.
Why doesn’t he aim at the bull’s eye instead?
The answer is projectile motion.
