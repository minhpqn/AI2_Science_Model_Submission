Sedimentary rocks form with the oldest layers on the bottom and the youngest on top.
Sediments are deposited horizontally so sedimentary rock layers are originally horizontal.
Sedimentary rock layers that are not horizontal are deformed.
Sedimentary rocks start out horizontal with the oldest on the bottom.
Sedimentary rocks that are not horizontal must be deformed.
This deformation produces geologic structures such as folds, joints, and faults that are caused by stresses.
We can look at the deformation and structures out the deformation history of the rock.
Sedimentary rocks are formed in horizontal layers.
This is magnificently displayed around the southwestern United States.
The arid climate allows rock layers to be well exposed ( Figure below ).
The lowest layers are the oldest, and the higher layers are younger.
This concept is called superposition since it deals with the positions of rock layers.

White layers of limestone are hard and form cliffs.
Red layers of shale are flakier and form slopes.
Folds, joints, and faults are caused by stresses.
If a sedimentary rock is tilted or folded, we know that stresses have changed the rock.
Sedimentary rocks are laid down horizontally with the oldest at the bottom.
Sedimentary rocks that are not horizontal have been deformed.
