Each group of three bases makes up a code word, and each code word represents one amino acid (represented here by a single letter, such as V, H, or L).
A string of code words specifies the sequence of amino acids in a protein.
DNA and RNA are nucleic acids.
Nucleic acids are built of small units called nucleotides.
The bases of DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.
In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil.
In DNA, A always binds to T, and G always binds to C.
The shape of the DNA molecule is known as a double helix.
DNA contains the genetic instructions for the correct sequence of amino acids in proteins.
RNA uses the information in DNA to assemble the correct amino acids and help make the protein.
