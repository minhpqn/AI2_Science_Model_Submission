In order for geometric isomers to exist, there must be a rigid structure in the molecule to prevent free rotation around a bond.
If the double bond in an alkene was capable of rotating, the two geometric isomers above would not exist.
In addition, the two carbon atoms must each have two different groups attached in order for there to be geometric isomers.
Propene has no geometric isomers because one of the carbon atoms has two single hydrogens bonded to it.
Propene has no structural isomers
Physical and chemical properties of geometric isomers are generally different.
While cis -2-butene is a polar molecule, trans -2-butene is nonpolar.
Heat or irradiation with light can be used to bring about the conversion of one geometric isomer to another.
The input of energy must be large enough to break the pi bond between the two carbon atoms, which is weaker than the sigma bond.
At that point, the now single bond is free to rotate and the isomers can interconvert.
As with alkenes, alkynes display structural isomerism beginning with 1-butyne and 2-butyne.
However, there are no geometric isomers with alkynes because there is only one other group bonded to the carbon atoms that are involved in the triple bond.
Structural and geometric isomers are defined.
Examples of alkane and alkene isomers are given.
