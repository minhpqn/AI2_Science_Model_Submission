The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution.
A solution with a lot of dissolved solute has a high concentration and is called a concentrated solution.
A solution with little dissolved solute has a low concentration and is called a dilute solution.
Calculating the Concentration of a Solution
The concentration of a solution represents the percentage of the solution that is the solute.
You can calculate the concentration of a solution using this formula:
\mathrm{Concentration= \frac{Mass \; (or \; volume) \; of \;
Solute}{Mass \; (or \; volume) \; of \;
Solution} \times 100\%}
For example, if a 100-gram solution of salt water contains 3 grams of salt, then its concentration is:
\mathrm{Concentration= \frac{3g}{100g} \times 100\%}=3\%
Q:
A 1000 mL container of brand A juice drink contains 250 mL of juice and 750 mL of water.
A 600 mL container of brand B juice drink contains 200 mL of juice and 400 mL of water.
Which brand of juice drink is more concentrated, brand A or brand B?
A: \mathrm{Concentration(A)= \frac{250\; mL}{1000\; mL} \times 100\%}=25\%
\mathrm{Concentration(B)= \frac{200\; mL}{600\; mL} \times 100\%}=33\%
You can conclude that brand B is more concentrated.
