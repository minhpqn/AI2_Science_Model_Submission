Tug of war illustrating the concept of net force
Q :
The boys in the Figure below are about to kick the soccer ball in opposite directions.
What will be the net force on the ball?
In which direction will the ball move?
Two soccer players illustrating the concept of net force
A :
The net force on the ball will be 50 N to the left (125 N – 75 N = 50 N), so the ball will move to the left.
Forces Acting in the Same Direction
If two forces act on an object in the same direction, the net force is equal to the sum of the two forces.
This always results in a stronger force than either of the individual forces alone.
In the Figure below , after the man on the left picks up the couch, he will push the couch to the right with a force of 25 Newtons, and the man on the right will pull the couch to the right with a force of 20 Newtons.
The net force on the couch is 45 Newtons to the right, so that’s the way the couch will move.
Workers illustrating the concept of net force
The net force acting on an object is the combination of all of the individual forces acting on it.
If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the net force is the difference between the two forces.
In this case, the net force is always greater than or equal to zero but less than either of the individual forces.
If two forces act on an object in the same direction, the net force is the sum of the two forces.
In this case, the net force is always greater than either of the individual forces.
