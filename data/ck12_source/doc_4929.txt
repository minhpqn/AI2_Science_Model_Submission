Organelle found in the cells of plants and algae; the site of manufacture and storage of important chemical compounds used by the cell; often contain pigments.
stroma :
Space outside the thylakoid membranes of a chloroplast; site of the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis.
thylakoid :
Sub-organelle within the chloroplast; site of the light reactions of photosynthesis.
tonoplast :
Membrane that surrounds the central vacuole.
Plant cells have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts.
The cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell, providing structural support and protection.
The central vacuole maintains turgor pressure against the cell wall.
Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to produce sugars for food.
Plasmodesmata are gaps between plant cells, connecting the cytoplasms of plant cells.
