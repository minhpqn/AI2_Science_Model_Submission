Yo-Yo Type Problems
Solve Yo-Yo type problems, where an object is rotating in free fall yet attached to a string (or some other similar restraint).
Students will learn to solve Yo-Yo type problems.
That is problems where an object is rotating in free fall yet attached to a string (or some other similar restraint).
\alpha = \tau_{net} / I
angular accelerations are produced by net torques,with inertia opposing acceleration; this is the rotational analog of a = F_{net} / m
\tau_{net} = \Sigma \tau_i = I \alpha
the net torque is the vector sum of all the torques acting on the object.
When adding torques it is necessary to subtract CW from CCW torques.
\tau = r \times F = r _\perp F = rF _\perp
individual torques are determined by multiplying the force applied by the perpendicular component of the moment arm
