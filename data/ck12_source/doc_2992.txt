In science, a theory is a broad explanation that is supported by a great deal of evidence.
Einstein Explained It All
In the early 1900s, Albert Einstein came up with a theory of gravity that actually explains gravity rather than simply describing its effects.
Einstein showed mathematically that gravity is not really a force that of attraction between all objects with mass, as Newton thought.
Instead, Einstein showed that gravity is a result of the warping, or curving, of space and time, which made up the same space-time “fabric.” These ideas about space-time and gravity became known as Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
If you watch the video at the URL below, you can see how Einstein developed his theory.
The video may also help you understand how Einstein’s theory differs from Newton’s law.
Visualizing Einstein’s Ideas
Einstein derived his theory using mathematics.
However, you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy.
Imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a trampoline.
The surface of the trampoline would curve downward instead of being flat.
Now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the trampoline.
What will happen?
It will roll down toward the bowling ball.
This apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the trampoline curves downward, not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity.
Einstein theorized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the trampoline.
The more massive a body is, the more it causes space-time to curve.
This idea is represented by the Figure below .
According to Einstein, objects move toward one another because of the curves in space-time, not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction.
