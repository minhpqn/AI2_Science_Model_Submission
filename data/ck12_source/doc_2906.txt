A dominant trait is the most influential trait and masks the other trait.
Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants?
All the offspring had purple flowers.
There was no blending of traits in any of Mendel's experiments.
Mendel had to come up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results.
He developed a theory called the law of segregation .
The Law of Segregation
Mendel proposed that each pea plant had two hereditary factors for each trait.
There were two possibilities for each hereditary factor, such as a purple factor or white factor.
One factor is dominant to the other.
The other trait that is masked is called the recessive factor, meaning that when both factors are present, only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable ( Figure below ).
Although you have two hereditary factors for each trait, each parent can only pass on one of these factors to the offspring.
When the sex cells, or gametes (sperm or egg), form, the heredity factors must separate, so there is only one factor per gamete.
In other words, the factors are "segregated" in each gamete.
Mendel's law of segregation states that the two hereditary factors separate when gametes are formed.
When fertilization occurs, the offspring receive one hereditary factor from each gamete, so the resulting offspring have two factors.
The law of segregation predates our understanding or meiosis.
Mendel developed his theories without an understanding of DNA, or even the knowledge that DNA existed.
Quite a remarkable feat!
