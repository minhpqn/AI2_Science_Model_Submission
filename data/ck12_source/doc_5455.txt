Is it using DNA to make better medicines and individualized treatments?
Is it analyzing DNA to determine predispositions to genetic diseases?
The answers to these questions, and many more, is yes.
And the answers to many of these issues begin with the Human Genome Project.
Scientists have sequenced a consensus version of the human genome.
Now what?
Do we know what all the genes are or what they do?
Not yet.
Do we know what phenotypes are associated with mutations in the genes?
For many genes, or even most genes, we do not.
Do we even know exactly how many genes we have?
Not exactly.
And we are far away from knowing what, at the genomic level, makes us all unique.
So how does this information help us?
The Human Genome Project has been labeled a landmark scientific event.
But what can we do with this information?
More on the Human Genome Project will be discussed in the DNA Technology:
The Human Genome Project (Advanced) concept.
There are many applications of genetic information, including applications in medicine and agriculture.
The applications of genetics to forensic science have become one of the most important aspects of the criminal justice system.
