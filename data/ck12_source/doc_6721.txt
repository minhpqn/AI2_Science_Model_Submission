We will use the equation F=ma to determine in which situation she exerts less force on the scale.
If the elevator is accelerating upward then the acceleration would be greater.
She would be pushed toward the floor of the elevator making her weight increase.
Therefore, she should weigh herself when the elevator is going down.
b) When the elevator is not accelerating, the scale would read 70.0\mathrm{kg} .
c) If the elevator was accelerating upward at a speed of 2.00\mathrm{m/s^2} , then the scale would read F=ma=70\mathrm{kg}\times (9.8\mathrm{m/s^2}+2\mathrm{m/s^2})=826\mathrm{N} which is 82.6\mathrm{kg} .
Question :
A spring with a spring constant of k=400\mathrm{N/m} has an uncompressed length of .23\mathrm{m} and a fully compressed length of .15\mathrm{m} .
What is the force required to fully compress the spring?
Solution :
We will use the equation F=kx to solve this.
We simply have to plug in the known value for the spring and the distance to solve for the force.
F=kx=(400\mathrm{N/m})(.23\mathrm{m}-.15\mathrm{m})=32\mathrm{N}
