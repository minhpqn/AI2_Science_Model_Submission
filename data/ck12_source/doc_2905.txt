What is a "simple" trait?
What is a heterozygote?
How is this different than a homozygote?
You breed a plant with yellow wrinkled peas with a plant with yellow smooth peas.
Both individuals are homozygous for both traits.
What will the peas of the next generation look like?
You breed plants with the same traits as in question 3, but this time the smooth trait is heterozygous in the second individual.
What will the peas of the next generation look like?
You breed two green wrinkled plants.
Will will the next generation look like?
What is genetics?
Why did Mendel choose to study pea plants?
How did Mendel's experiments disprove the idea that we are simply a "blend" of our parents' traits?
What were the results Mendel consistently identified in his experiments?
Mendel's Laws and Genetics
Distinguish between dominant and recessive traits.
Explain the law of segregation.
What does it mean to be dominant?
The most powerful or influential individual in a group is sometimes called dominant.
In genetics, a dominant trait means nearly the same thing.
