Particles of Elements
The smallest particle of an element that still has the properties of that element is the atom .
Atoms actually consist of smaller particles, including protons and electrons, but these smaller particles are the same for all elements.
All the atoms of an element are like one another, and are different from the atoms of all other elements.
For example, the atoms of each element have a unique number of protons.
Consider carbon as an example.
Carbon atoms have six protons.
They also have six electrons.
All carbon atoms are the same whether they are found in a lump of coal or a teaspoon of table sugar ( Figure below ).
On the other hand, carbon atoms are different from the atoms of hydrogen, which are also found in coal and sugar.
Each hydrogen atom has just one proton and one electron.
Carbon is a major element of coal and sugar
Carbon is the main element in coal (left).
Carbon is also a major component of sugar (right).
Q:
Why do you think coal and sugar are so different from one another when carbon is a major component of each substance?
A:
Coal and sugar differ from one another because they contain different proportions of carbon and other elements.
For example, coal is about 85 percent carbon, whereas table sugar is about 42 percent carbon.
