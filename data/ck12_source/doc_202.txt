The more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball.
This is true of all falling objects.
They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity, unless air resistance affects one object more than another.
For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling acorn because of the leafâ€™s greater surface area.
You can simulate the effect of air resistance on acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL:
Q :
If a leaf and an acorn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air (that is, in a vacuum), how would this affect their acceleration due to gravity?
A :
They would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time.
When gravity pulls objects toward the ground, it always causes them to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s 2 .
Regardless of differences in mass, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity unless air resistance affects one more than another.
Watch the video at the following URL.
Based on the teens interviewed in the video, identify two common misconceptions about gravity, mass, and acceleration due to gravity.
Then explain why each misconception is false.
