Most can do experiments to test those materials.
Biologists can collect cells, seeds, or sea urchins to study in the laboratory.
Physicists can test the strength of metal or smash atoms into each other.
Geologists can chip away at rocks and test their chemistry.
What can astronomers use to study space?
Light and other electromagnetic waves, of course.
This is the Andromeda Galaxy as it appeared 2.5 million years ago.
Why is the light so old?
Earth is just a tiny speck in the Universe.
Our planet is surrounded by lots of space.
Light travels across empty space.
Light is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
Astronomers use the light and other energy that comes to us to gather information about the Universe.
The Speed of Light
In space, light travels at about 300,000,000 meters per second (670,000,000 miles per hour).
How fast is that?
A beam of light could travel from New York to Los Angeles and back again nearly 40 times in just one second.
Even at that amazing rate, objects in space are so far away that it takes a lot of time for their light to reach us.
Even light from the nearest star, our sun, takes about eight minutes to reach Earth.
We need a really big unit to measure distances out in space because distances between stars are so great.
