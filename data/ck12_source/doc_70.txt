Seven or more paired gill pouches .
These organs take dissolved oxygen from water.
The branchial arches , a series of arches that support the gills of aquatic amphibians and fishes.
They lie close to the body's surface.
A light sensitive pineal eye , an eye-like structure that can detect light.
A cartilaginous skeleton , a skeleton made of a flexible rubber-like supportive material called cartilage.
This is similar to the skeleton of cartilaginous fish, which includes sharks and rays.
A heart with two chambers.
Reproduction using external fertilization.
They are ectothermic .
This means that their internal temperature depends on the temperature of their environment.
Classification of Jawless Fish
Most scientists agree that the jawless fish are part of the the superclass Agnatha.
They belong to the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata.
There are two living groups of jawless fish, with about 100 species in total: lampreys and hagfish ( Figure below ).
Although hagfish belong to the subphylum Vertebrata, they do not technically have vertebrae (though they do have a skull), whereas lampreys do have vertebrae.
For this reason, scientists still disagree on the classification of jawless fish.
