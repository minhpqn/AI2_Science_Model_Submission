Characteristics of the Genetic Code
The genetic code has a number of important characteristics.
The genetic code is universal.
All known living organisms use the same genetic code.
This shows that all organisms share a common evolutionary history.
The genetic code is unambiguous.
Each codon codes for just one amino acid (or start or stop).
What might happen if codons encoded more than one amino acid?
The genetic code is redundant.
Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon.
In Figure above , how many codons code for the amino acid threonine?
What might be an advantage of having more than one codon for the same amino acid?
The genetic code consists of the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA.
Groups of three bases form codons, and each codon stands for one amino acid (or start or stop).
The codons are read in sequence following the start codon until a stop codon is reached.
The genetic code is universal, unambiguous, and redundant.
