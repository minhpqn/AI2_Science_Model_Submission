The same amount of energy is spread over a greater area, so the intensity and loudness of the sound is less.
This explains why even loud sounds fade away as you move farther from the source.
Sound wave intensity in relation to distance from source
This diagram represents just a small section of the total area of sound waves spreading out from a source.
Sound waves actually travel away from the source in all directions.
Q:
Why can low-amplitude sounds like whispers be heard only over short distances?
A:
The sound waves already have so little energy that spreading them out over a wider area quickly reduces their intensity below the level of hearing.
Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener.
The loudness of sound is determined, in turn, by the intensity, or amount of energy, in sound waves.
The unit of intensity is the decibel (dB).
As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder.
For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater.
Intensity of sound results from two factors: the amplitude of the sound waves and how far they have traveled from the source of the sound.
