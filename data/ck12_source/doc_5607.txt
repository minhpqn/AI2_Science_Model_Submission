Derived SI Units
length × width
length × width × height
mass × acceleration
force × length
Using dimensional analysis with derived units requires special care.
When units are squared or cubed as with area or volume, the conversion factors themselves must also be squared.
Shown below is the conversion factor for cubic centimeters and cubic meters.
\left(\frac{1 \ \text{m}}{100 \ \text{cm}}\right)^3=\frac{1 \ \text{m}^3}{10^6 \ \text{cm}^3}=1
Because a cube has 3 sides, each side is subject to the conversion of 1 m to 100 cm.
Since 100 cubed is equal to 1 million (10 6 ), there are 10 6 cm 3 in 1 m 3 .
Two convenient volume units are the liter, which is equal to a cubic decimeter, and the milliliter, which is equal to a cubic centimeter.
The conversion factor would be:
\left(\frac{1 \ \text{dm}}{10 \ \text{cm}}\right)^3 = \frac{1 \ \text{dm}^3}{1000 \ \text{cm}^3}=1
There are thus 1000 cm 3 in 1 dm 3 , which is the same thing as saying there are 1000 mL in 1 L
1000 milliliter cubes are in a liter cube
There are 1000 cm 3 in 1 dm 3 .
Since a cm 3 is equal to a mL and a dm 3 is equal to a L, we can say that there are 1000 mL in 1 L.
