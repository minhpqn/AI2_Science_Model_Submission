This pattern is typical of plants, invertebrates, and many species of fish.
See  for an overview of survivorship curves.
The Type I strategy occurs more often in stable environments.
The Type III strategy is more likely in unstable environments.
Can you explain why?
The age-sex structure of a population is the number of individuals of each sex and age in the population.
Age-sex structure influences population growth.
It is represented by a population pyramid.
The number of survivors at each age is plotted on a survivorship curve.
