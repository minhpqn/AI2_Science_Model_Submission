They became a drain on the family’s income.
Eventually, birth rates fell to match death rates.
As a result, population growth slowed to nearly zero.
Stages of the Demographic Transition
These changes in population that occurred in Europe and North America have been called the demographic transition .
The transition can be summarized in the following four stages, which are illustrated in Figure below :
Stage 1—High birth and death rates lead to slow population growth.
Stage 2—The death rate falls but the birth rate remains high, leading to faster population growth.
Stage 3—The birth rate starts to fall, so population growth starts to slow.
Stage 4—The birth rate reaches the same low level as the death rate, so population growth slows to zero.

Stages of the Demographic Transition.
In the demographic transition, the death rate falls first.
After a lag, the birth rate also falls.
How do these changes affect the rate of population growth over time?
Major changes in the human population first began during the 1700s.
This occurred in Europe and North America.
First, death rates fell while birth rates remained high.
This led to rapid population growth.
Later, birth rates also fell.
