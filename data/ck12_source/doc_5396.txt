A location in DNA that has neither a purine nor a pyrimidine base; apurinic or apyrimidinic site; also known as an a basic site.
base excision repair :
A cellular mechanism that repairs damaged DNA throughout the cell cycle.
DNA mismatch repair :
A system for recognizing and repairing insertions, deletions and mis-incorporation of bases in the DNA.
DNA repair :
A collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to its DNA.
global genomic NER :
Repairs damage in both transcribed and untranscribed DNA strands in active and inactive genes throughout the genome.
nucleotide excision repair :
DNA repair mechanism that repair DNA damaged by a variety of mutagens.
transcription-coupled NER :
Repair process initiated when RNA polymerase detects a changes in the double helix shape.
DNA repair mechanisms correct mistakes caused naturally or by mutagens in the DNA sequence.
DNA repair mechanisms may excise the base or the whole nucleotide prior to repairing with the correct sequence.
Numerous proteins are involved in this process.
