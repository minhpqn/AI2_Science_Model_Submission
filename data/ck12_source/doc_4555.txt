If the alveoli below were purple, they could resemble a bunch of grapes.
Of course, as the alveoli are in the lungs, they must be very small to provide enough area for the exchange of gases.
In fact, there are about 300 million alveoli in the adult lung.
Journey of a Breath of Air
Take in a big breath of air through your nose.
As you inhale, you may feel the air pass down your throat and notice your chest expand.
Now exhale and observe the opposite events occurring.
Inhaling and exhaling may seem like simple actions, but they are just part of the complex process of respiration, which includes these four steps:
Pulmonary gas exchange
Peripheral gas exchange
Respiration begins with ventilation.
This is the process of moving air in and out of the lungs.
The lungs are the organs in which gas exchange takes place between blood and air.
Air enters the respiratory system through the nose.
As the air passes through the nasal cavity, mucus and hairs trap any particles in the air.
The air is also warmed and moistened so it wonâ€™t harm delicate tissues of the lungs.
Next, the air passes through the pharynx , a long tube that is shared with the digestive system.
A flap of connective tissue called the epiglottis closes when food is swallowed to prevent choking.
From the pharynx, air next passes through the larynx , or voice box.
The larynx contains vocal cords, which allow us to produce vocal sounds.
