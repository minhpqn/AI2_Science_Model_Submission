Together they form the salt known as sodium chloride.
You may know the compound as table salt or the mineral halite.
The amount of salts in ocean water varies from place to place.
For example, near the mouth of a river, ocean water may be less salty.
Thatâ€™s because river water contains less salt than ocean water.
Where the ocean is warm, the water may be more salty.
Can you explain why? (Hint:
More water evaporates when the water is warm.)
Seawater has lots of salts in it.
This increases its density (mass per volume) over fresh water.
Temperature and pressure also affect density.
Water density increases as:
Differences in water density are responsible for deep ocean currents, as will be discussed in the concept "Deep Ocean Currents."
Water moving through rock and soil picks up ions.
Those ions end up as salts in large bodies of water.
Ocean water contains salts and other substances.
Water density increases as salinity and pressure increase, or as temperature decreases.
