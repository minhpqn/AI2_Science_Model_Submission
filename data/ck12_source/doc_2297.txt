For example, if you had let go of your communications device back home, it would have just stayed in place by your upper appendage.
You notice that everything you let go of falls to the ground.
Using inductive reasoning, you conclude that all objects fall to the ground on Earth.
Then, you make the observation pictured ( Figure below ).
You see round objects rising up into the sky, rather than falling toward the ground as you expect.
Clearly, your first conclusion—although based on many pieces of evidence—is incorrect.
You need to gather more evidence to come to a conclusion that explains all of your observations.
Balloons floating up into the air
Evidence that not everything falls to the ground on Earth.
Q:
What conclusion might you draw based on the additional evidence of the balloons rising instead of falling?
A:
With this and other evidence, you might conclude that objects heavier than air fall to the ground but objects lighter than air do not.
Limits on Inductive Reasoning
Inductive reasoning can’t solve a crime or arrive at the correct scientific conclusion with 100 percent certainty.
It’s always possible that some piece of evidence remains to be found that would disprove the conclusion.
That’s why jurors in a trial are told to decide whether the defendant is guilty “without a reasonable doubt”—not without a shred of doubt.
Similarly, a scientific theory is never really proven conclusively to be true.
However, it can be supported by so much evidence that it is accepted “without a reasonable doubt.”
Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence.
