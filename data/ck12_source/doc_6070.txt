Held together by weak intermolecular forces.
Define amorphous solid.
List properties of amorphous solids.
Rubber has many useful properties because it is an amorphous solid
Have you ever gotten a flat tire?
When a tire goes flat, its shape changes.
The tire might be flat because of a slow leak in the tire valve.
It could be flat because it ran over a nail or screw and ended up with a small hole where the air can leak out over a period of time.
Or it could go flat when it hits a large rock or other object while travelling at high speeds (this one is for those readers who enjoy detective movies or TV shows).
What if a crystalline solid like LiBr were ever made into a tire (now thereâ€™s a weird idea)?
When it encountered a blow, the crystal would break into small pieces.
Since rubber is an amorphous solid, it has a very different set of physical properties.
Unlike a crystalline solid, an amorphous solid is a solid that lacks an ordered internal structure.
Some examples of amorphous solids include rubber, plastic, and gels.
Glass is a very important amorphous solid that is made by cooling a mixture of materials in such a way that it does not crystallize.
Glass is sometimes referred to as a supercooled liquid rather than a solid.
If you have ever watched a glassblower in action, you have noticed that he takes advantage of the fact that amorphous solids do not have a distinct melting point like crystalline solids do.
Instead, as glass is heated, it slowly softens and can be shaped into all sorts of interesting forms.
When a glass object shatters, it does so in a very irregular way, unlike crystalline solids, which always break into fragments that have the same shape as dictated by its crystal system.
