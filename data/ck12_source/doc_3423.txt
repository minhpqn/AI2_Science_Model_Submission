Describe the role of variables in a scientific experiment.
Propose a detailed scientific experiment.
So what exactly is an experiment?
At first you may picture a science laboratory with microscopes and chemicals and people in white lab coats.
But do all experiments have to be done in a lab?
And do all scientists have to wear lab coats?
Figure below shows a laboratory experiment involving plants.
An experiment is a special type of scientific investigation that is performed under controlled conditions, usually in a laboratory.
Some experiments can be very simple, but even the simplest can contribute important evidence that helps scientists better understand the natural world.
An example experiment can be seen here or here .
As many different types of experiments are possible, an experiment must be designed to produce data that can help confirm or reject the hypothesis.
Laboratory experiment studying plant growth
A laboratory experiment studying plant growth.
What might this experiment involve?
Scientist looking through microscope
In this experiment, a scientist is conducting research (and taking notes) while looking through a microscope.
Medicine From the Ocean Floor
Scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz are looking to perhaps the largest resource yet to be explored for its medical potential: the ocean.
And they are taping this resource with some state-of-the-art technology.
These scientists are using robots to sort through thousands of marine chemicals in search of cures for diseases like cholera, breast cancer, and malaria.
