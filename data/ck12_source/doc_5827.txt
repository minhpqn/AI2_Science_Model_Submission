Did you know that mold is a type of fungus?
There are many different types of fungi besides molds, however, including mushrooms.
Mold and mushrooms are obviously different.
So how are these fungi classified?
Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom.
They thought this because fungi had several similarities to plants.
For example:
Fungi and plants have similar structures.
Plants and fungi live in the same kinds of habitats, such as growing in soil.
Plants and fungi cells both have a cell wall, which animals do not have.
How Fungi and Plants Differ
However, there are a number of characteristics that make fungi different from plants:
Fungi cannot make their own food like plants can, since they do not have chloroplasts and cannot carry out photosynthesis.
Fungi are more like animals because they are heterotrophs, as opposed to autotrophs, like plants, that make their own food.
Fungi have to obtain their food, nutrients and glucose, from outside sources.
The cell walls in many species of fungi contain chitin.
Chitin is tough carbohydrate found in the shells of animals such as beetles and lobsters.
The cell wall of a plant is made of cellulose, not chitin.
Unlike many plants, most fungi do not have structures, such as xylem and phloem, that transfer water and nutrients.
