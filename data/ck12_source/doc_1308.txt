Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries.
All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes.
Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move.
As the plates move, stresses build.
When the stresses build too much, the rocks break.
The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks.
The sudden release of energy is an earthquake.
During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters.
Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters.
Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).
Diagram of the elastic rebound theory
Elastic rebound theory.
Stresses build on both sides of a fault.
The rocks deform plastically as seen in Time 2.
When the stresses become too great, the rocks return to their original shape.
To do this, the rocks move, as seen in Time 3.
This movement releases energy, creating an earthquake.

Focus and Epicenter
The two important words used to describe an earthquake's location are focus and epicenter.
