The bare soil is easily eroded by wind and water.
Sheep and goats grazing can damage plants and leave the soil bare

Logging, Mining and Construction
Other human actions that put soil at risk include logging, mining, and construction.
You can see examples of each below ( Figure below ).
When forests are cut down, the soil is suddenly exposed to wind and rain.
Without trees, there is no leaf litter to cover the ground and protect the soil.
When leaf litter decays, it adds humus and nutrients to the soil.
Mining and construction strip soil off the ground and leave the land bare.
Paved roads and parking lots prevent rainwater from soaking into the ground.
This increases runoff and the potential for soil erosion.
Logging, mining, construction, and paving surfaces are some of the ways that soil erosion increases
Logging, mining, construction, and paving surfaces are some of the ways that soil erosion increases.
Even things that people do for fun can expose soil to erosion.
For example, overuse of hiking trails can leave bare patches of soil.
Off-road vehicles cause even more damage; examples of this are pictured below ( Figure below ).
Off-road vehicles can destroy plants and leave the ground bare, which increases erosion
Whatâ€™s fun for people may be bad for soil.
Off-road vehicles can destroy plants and leave the ground bare.
