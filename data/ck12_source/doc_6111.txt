Gas Stoichiometry and the Ideal Gas Law
What volume of carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of 25.21 g of ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) at 54Â°C and 728 mmHg?
Assume the gas is ideal.
Before using the ideal gas law, it is necessary to write and balance the chemical equation.
Recall that most combustion reactions, the given substance reacts with O 2 to form CO 2 and H 2 O.
Here is the balanced equation for the combustion of ethanol.
\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}(l)+3\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{CO}_2(g)+3\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
Step 1:
List the known quantities and solve the problem.
\text{mass} \ \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}=25.21 \text{ g}
\text{molar mass} \ \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}=46.08 \text{ g/mol}
P=728 \text{ mmHg}
T=54^\circ \text{C}=327 \text{ K}
\text{Volume} \ \text{CO}_2=? \text{ L}
The number of moles of carbon dioxide gas is first calculated by stoichiometry.
Then the ideal gas law is used to calculate the volume of CO 2 produced.
Step 2:
Solve.
25.21 \text{ g } \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol } \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}{46.08 \text{ g } \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}} \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } \text{CO}_2}{1 \text{ mol } \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}}=1.094 \text{ mol } \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}
The moles of ethanol  (n) is now substituted into  PV=nRT to solve for the volume.
