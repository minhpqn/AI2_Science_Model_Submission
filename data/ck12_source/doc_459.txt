The pituitary gland will then release a lower amount of ADH into the blood.
This means less water will be reabsorbed by the blood.
The kidneys then produce a large volume of urine.
What color will this urine be?
The pituitary gland helps regulate the production of urine
The pituitary gland (green) is found directly below the brain and releases hormones that control how urine is produced.
Water and waste molecules move out of the blood capillaries and into the nephrons of the kidney to form the urine.
ADH is the hormone released by the pituitary gland and controls how water is reabsorbed by the blood from the kidneys.
