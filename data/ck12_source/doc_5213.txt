The Law of Independent Assortment
The Law of Independent Assortment , also known as or Mendel's Second Law, states that the inheritance of one trait will not affect the inheritance of another.
Mendel concluded that different traits are inherited independently of each other, so that there is no relationship, for example, between seed color and seed shape.
In modern terms, alleles of each gene separate independently during gamete formation.
Mendel's Laws Rediscovered
You might think that Mendel's discoveries would have made a big impact on science as soon as he made them.
But you would be wrong.
Why?
Because Mendel's work was largely ignored.
Mendel was far ahead of his time and working from a remote monastery.
He had no reputation among the scientific community and limited previously published work.
Mendelâ€™s work, titled Experiments in Plant Hybridization , was published in 1866, and sent to prominent libraries in several countries, as well as 133 natural science associations.
Mendel himself even sent carefully marked experiment kits to Karl von Nageli, the leading botanist of the day.
The result - it was almost completely ignored.
Von Nageli instead sent hawkweed seeds to Mendel, which he thought was a better plant for studying heredity.
Unfortunately hawkweed reproduces asexually, resulting in genetically identical clones of the parent.
Charles Darwin published his landmark book on evolution in 1869, not long after Mendel had discovered his laws.
