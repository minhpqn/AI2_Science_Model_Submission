electron configuration:
A map of the electrons for a given atom.
d orbital:
Five orbitals characterized by l=2 .
f orbitals:
The most complex set of orbitals with seven orbital shapes for  l=3 .
p orbitals:
Three dumbbell shaped orbitals for l=1 .
s orbitals:
Spherical orbitals where l=0 .
State the Aufbau principle.
Use the Aufbau principle to determine the electron configuration of an atom.
Construction of a building starts from the bottom, like the Aufbau Principle
How are buildings constructed?
Construction of a building begins at the bottom.
The foundation is laid and the building goes up step by step.
You obviously cannot start with the roof since there is no place to hang it.
The building goes from the lowest level to the highest level in a systematic way.
In order to create ground state electron configurations for any element, it is necessary to know the way in which the atomic sublevels are organized in order of increasing energy.
The Figure below shows the order of increasing energy of the sublevels.
