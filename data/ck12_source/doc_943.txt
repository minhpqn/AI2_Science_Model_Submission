The third type was extremely penetrating and could pass through several centimeters of lead.
They named these three types of radiation alpha (\alpha) , beta (\beta) , and gamma (\gamma) respectively.
Eventually, each type of radiation was further identified.
Alpha particles are the nuclei of helium atoms, ^4_2 He .
Beta particles are electrons, and gamma rays are very high energy photons (even higher energy than x-rays).
When a nucleus emits an  \alpha particle, the remaining particle will contain two less protons and two less neutrons.  The new particle will have an atomic number two less and a mass number four less than the original nuclide.
^{226}_{88} Ra \longrightarrow {^{222}_{86}Rn}+ {^4_2 He}
The daughter product, ^{222}_{86} Rn , is different from the parent nucleus, ^{226}_{88} Ra , by two protons and two neutrons.
This changing of one element into another is called transmutation.
Transmutation also occurs when a nucleus undergoes  \beta decay.
An example of beta decay is the emission of an electron by a carbon-14 nucleus.
^{14}_6 C \longrightarrow {^{14}_7 N}+{^0_{-1} e}
The symbol {^0_{-1}e}  represents an electron whose charge corresponds to  Z=-1 and since it has no nucleons, A=0 .
It must be carefully noted that the electron released during beta decay is NOT an orbital electron but an electron whose origin was in the nucleus.
The process has one neutron becoming one proton and one electron and the electron being emitted as a beta particle.
Since a neutron has been lost AND a proton has been gained, the mass number does not change.
The atomic number, however, has increased one due to the gain of a proton.
Therefore, as a result of beta decay, the daughter product will have the same mass number as the parent and an atomic number one greater than the parent.
The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons.
This is known as mass defect.
