Examples of molecular and ionic equations are shown.
Read the material at the link below and solve the practice equations:
What do the small letters after the compounds indicate?
Why is it important to show the state of each compound?
What do ionic equations tell us?
ionic equation:  An equation in which dissolved ionic compounds are shown as free ions.
molecular equation:  An equation in which the formulas of the compounds are written as though all substances exist as molecules
Net Ionic Equations
Define spectator ion.
Define net ionic equation.
Write and balance net ionic equations.
The spectators in a reaction do not participate directly, but play an important role
Yes, we need the crowd.
At sports events around the world, we can see a small number of athletes fiercely competing on the field.
They get tired, dirty, and sometimes hurt as they try to win the game.
Surrounding them are thousands of spectators watching and cheering.
Would the game be different without the spectators?
Yes, it definitely would.
They provide encouragement to the team and generate enthusiasm.
The spectators are not really playing the game, but they are certainly a part of the process.
