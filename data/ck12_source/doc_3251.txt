The extremely high energy of gamma rays allows them to penetrate just about anything.
They can even pass through bones and teeth.
This makes gamma rays very dangerous.
They can destroy living cells, produce gene mutations, and cause cancer.
Ironically, the deadly effects of gamma rays can be used to treat cancer.
In this type of treatment, a medical device sends out focused gamma rays that target cancerous cells.
The gamma rays kill the cells and destroy the cancer.
Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies.
Higher-frequency waves have more energy.
Of all electromagnetic waves, gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies.
Because of their very high frequencies, gamma rays have more energy than any other electromagnetic waves.
Sources of gamma rays include radioactive atoms, nuclear explosions, and stars.
Gamma rays from space are absorbed by Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
Gamma rays can destroy living cells, produce mutations, and cause cancer.
They can be used to treat cancer by focusing the deadly rays on cancer cells.
