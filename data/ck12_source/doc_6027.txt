This measurement is called the percent yield.
To compute the percent yield, it is first necessary to determine how much of the product should be formed based on stoichiometry.
This is called the theoretical yield , the maximum amount of product that could be formed from the given amounts of reactants.
The actual yield is the amount of product that is actually formed when the reaction is carried out in the laboratory.
The percent yield is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.
\text{Percent Yield} =\frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\%
Percent yield is very important in the manufacture of products.
Much time and money is spent improving the percent yield for chemical production.
When complex chemicals are synthesized by many different reactions, one step with a low percent yield can quickly cause a large waste of reactants and unnecessary expense.
Typically, percent yields are understandably less than 100% because of the reasons indicated earlier.
However, percent yields greater than 100% are possible if the measured product of the reaction contains impurities that cause its mass to be greater than it actually would be if the product was pure.
When a chemist synthesizes a desired chemical, he or she is always careful to purify the products of the reaction.
Sample Problem:
Calculating the Theoretical Yield and the Percent Yield
Potassium chlorate decomposes upon slight heating in the presence of a catalyst according to the reaction below:
2\text{KClO}_3(s) \rightarrow 2\text{KCl}(s)+3\text{O}_2(g)
In a certain experiment, 40.0 g KClO 3 is heated until it completely decomposes.
What is the theoretical yield of oxygen gas?
The experiment is performed and the oxygen gas is collected and its mass is found to be 14.9 g.
What is the percent yield for the reaction?
