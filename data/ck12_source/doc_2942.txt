Define transgenic crop.
Explain how biotechnology can be used in agriculture.
Have you ever eaten genetically engineered foods?
Most likely, yes.
The majority of the corn in the United States is genetically engineered.
Corn syrup is used to sweeten many things, like this soft drink.
Corn is also fed to the cows that provided this hamburger.
Biotechnology in Agriculture
Biotechnology is changing the genetic makeup of living things to make a useful product.
Biotechnology has led scientists to develop useful applications in agriculture and food science.
These include the development of transgenic crops.
In transgenic crops, genes are placed into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait.
Benefits include:
Improved yield from crops.
Increased resistance of crops to environmental stresses.
Increased nutritional qualities of food crops.
Improved taste, texture or appearance of food.
Reduced dependence on fertilizers, insecticides, and other chemicals.
Crops are obviously dependent on environmental conditions.
Drought can destroy crop yields, as can too much rain and floods.
