Weight Gain and Obesity
Any unused energy in food is stored in the body as fat.
This is true whether the extra energy comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids.
What happens if you take in more energy than you use, day after day?
You will store more and more fat and become overweight.
Eventually, you may become obese.
Obesity is having a very high percentage of body fat.
Obese people are at least 20 percent heavier than their healthy weight range.
The excess body fat of obesity is linked to many diseases.
Obese people often have serious health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.
They are also more likely to develop arthritis and some types of cancer.
People who remain obese during their entire adulthood usually do not live as long as people who stay within a healthy weight range.
