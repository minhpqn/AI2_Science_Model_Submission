Thatâ€™s because gravity pulls water and ice downhill.
These are ways gravity causes erosion indirectly.
But gravity also causes erosion directly.
Gravity can pull soil, mud, and rocks down cliffs and hillsides.
This type of erosion and deposition is called mass wasting .
It may happen suddenly.
Or it may occur very slowly, over many years.
Landslides are the most dramatic, sudden, and dangerous types of mass wasting.
Landslides are sudden falls of rock; by contrast, avalanches are sudden falls of snow.
Weathered material may fall away from a cliff because there is nothing to keep it in place.
Rocks that fall to the base of a cliff make a talus slope .
Sometimes as one rock falls, it hits another rock, which hits another rock, and begins a landslide.
A landslide can be very destructive ( Figure below ).
It may bury or carry away entire villages.
Air trapped under the falling rocks acts as a cushion that keeps the rock from slowing down.
Landslides can move as fast as 200 to 300 km/hour.
Landslide blocking a highway
This landslide in California in 2008 blocked Highway 140.
Landslides often occur on steep slopes in dry or semi-arid climates.
The California coastline, with its steep cliffs and years of drought punctuated by seasons of abundant rainfall, is prone to landslides.
