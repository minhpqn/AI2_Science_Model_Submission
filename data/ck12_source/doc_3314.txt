Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose.
More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose.
In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire.
A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire.
Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter.
A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire.
Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly.
Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current.
Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures.

Is Resistance Good or Bad?
Resistance can be helpful or just a drain on electrical energy.
If the aim is to transmit electric current through a wire from one place to another, then resistance is a drawback.
It reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transmitted because some of the current is absorbed by particles of matter.
On the other hand, if the aim is to use electricity to produce heat or light, then resistance is useful.
When particles of matter absorb electrical energy, they change it to heat or light.
For example, when electric current flows through the tungsten wire inside an incandescent light bulb like the one in the Figure below , the tungsten resists the flow of electric charge.
It absorbs electrical energy and converts some of it to light and heat.
Whatâ€™s wrong with this picture? (Hint:
How does current get to the light bulb?)
