The types of interactions are reflection, refraction, and diffraction.
Each type of interaction is described in detail below.
You can see animations of the three types at this URL:
An echo is an example of wave reflection.
Reflection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface they cannot pass through.
Reflection can happen with any type of waves, not just sound waves.
For example, light waves can also be reflected.
In fact, thatâ€™s how we see most objects.
Light from a light source, such as the sun or a light bulb, shines on the object and some of the light is reflected.
When the reflected light enters our eyes, we can see the object.
Reflected waves have the same speed and frequency as the original waves before they were reflected.
However, the direction of the reflected waves is different.
When waves strike an obstacle head on, the reflected waves bounce straight back in the direction they came from.
When waves strike an obstacle at any other angle, they bounce back at the same angle but in a different direction.
This is illustrated in the Figure below .
In this diagram, waves strike a wall at an angle, called the angle of incidence.
The waves are reflected at the same angle, called the angle of reflection, but in a different direction.
Notice that both angles are measured relative to a line that is perpendicular to the wall.

Refraction is another way that waves interact with matter.
