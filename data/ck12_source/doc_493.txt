Your eyes obviously play a role in balance.
But your ears play an even bigger role.
The gymnast pictured below ( Figure below ) may not realize it, but her ears—along with her cerebellum—are mostly responsible for her ability to perform on the balance beam.
This gymnast uses the semicircular canals of the ear to keep her balance
This gymnast is using the semicircular canals in her ears, along with the cerebellum in her brain, to help keep her balance on the balance beam.
The parts of the ears involved in balance are the semicircular canals .
Above, the semicircular canals are colored purple ( Figure above ).
The canals contain liquid and are like the bottle of water pictured below ( Figure below ).
When the bottle tips, the water surface moves up and down the sides of the bottle.
When the body tips, the liquid in the semicircular canals moves up and down the sides of the canals.
Tiny hair cells line the semicircular canals.
Movement of the liquid inside the canals causes the hair cells to send nerve impulses.
The nerve impulses travel to the cerebellum in the brain along the vestibular nerve.
In response, the cerebellum sends commands to muscles to contract or relax so that the body stays balanced.
A bottle of water can be used to model the semicircular canals in your ear
This bottle of water models the semicircular canals in your ears.
When you tip the bottle, the water moves up or down the sides of the bottle; when you tip your head, the liquid inside the semicircular canals moves up and down the sides of the canals.
Tiny hair cells lining the canals sense the movement of liquid and send messages to the brain.
At the end of the ear canal, sound waves hit the eardrum, which passes vibrations through a series of bones to the cochlea.
The parts of the ears involved in balance are the semicircular canals.
