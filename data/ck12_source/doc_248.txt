You are sitting in a chair at some distance from the merry-go-round so that the only part of the system that is visible to you is the light bulb.
The movement of the light will appear to you to be back and forth in simple harmonic motion.
Circular motion and simple harmonic motion have a lot in common.
The greatest displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position is called the amplitude of the motion.
One cycle refers to the complete to-and-fro motion that starts at some position, goes all the way to one side, then all the way to the other side, and returns to the original position.
The period , T , is the time required for one cycle and the frequency , f , is the number of cycles that occur in exactly 1.00 second.
The frequency, in this case, is the reciprocal of the period.
Example Problem:
When a 500. kg crate of cargo is placed in the bed of a pickup truck, the truck's springs compress 4.00 cm.
Assume the springs act as a single spring.
(a) What is the spring constant for the truck springs?
(b) How far with the springs compress if 800. kg of cargo is placed in the truck bed?
(a) k=\frac{F}{x}=\frac{(500. \ \text{kg})(9.80 \ \text{m/s}^2)}{0.0400 \ \text{m}}=1.23 \times 10^5 \ \text{N/m}
(b) x=\frac{F}{k}=\frac{(800. \ \text{kg})(9.80 \ \text{m/s}^2)}{1.23 \times 10^5 \ \text{N/m}}=0.064 \ \text{m}=6.4 \ \text{cm}
Simple harmonic motion occurs in many situations, including an object of the end of a spring, a tuning fork, a pendulum, and strings on a guitar or piano.
A mass oscillating on a horizontal spring is often used to analyze SHM.
The restoring force for a mass oscillating on a horizontal spring is related to the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position, F = -kx .
SHM is related to uniform circular motion when the uniform circular motion is viewed in one dimension.
