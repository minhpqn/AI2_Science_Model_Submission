A good diffraction grating has 2500 lines/cm.
What is the distance between two lines on the grating?
Solution: d =\frac{1}{2500 \ cm^{-1}}=0.00040 \ cm
Example Problem:
Using a diffraction grating with a spacing of 0.00040 cm, a red line appears 16.5 cm from the central line on the screen.
The screen is 1.00 m from the grating.
What is the wavelength of the light?
Solution: \lambda=\frac{xd}{L}=\frac{(0.165 \ m)(4.0 \times 10^{-6} \ m)}{1.00 \ m}=6.6 \times 10^{-7} \ m
Diffraction gratings can be made by blocking light from traveling through a translucent medium; the clear places behave as slits similar to the slits in a double slit experiment.
Diffraction gratings form interference patterns much like double slits, though brighter and with more space between the lines.
The equation used with double slit experiments to measure wavelength is adjusted slightly to work with diffraction gratings.  \lambda=\frac{xd}{L}=d \sin \theta

How does a diffraction grating differ from single or double slit?
What happens when you increase the number of slits in a diffraction grating?
White light is directed toward a diffraction grating and that light passes through the grating, causing its monochromatic bands appear on the screen.
Which color will be closest to the central white?
Three discrete spectral lines occur at angles of 10.1°, 13.7°, and 14.8° respectively in the first order spectrum.
If the grating has 3660 lines/cm, what are the wavelengths of these three colors of light?
A 20.0 mm section of diffraction grating has 6000 lines.
At what angle will the maximum bright band appear if the wavelength is 589 nm?
