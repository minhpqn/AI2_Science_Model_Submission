In eukaryotic cells, the transcription of the polyadenylation signals indicates the termination of the process.
The mRNA transcript is then cut off of the RNA polymerase and freed from the DNA.
The cleavage site is characterized by the presence of the sequence AAUAAA near the end of the transcribed message.
Polyadenylation then occurs.
Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3’-end of the mRNA.
The poly(A) tail may consist of as many as 80 to 250 adenosine residues.
The poly(A) tail protects the mRNA from degradation by exonucleases.
Poladenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation.

5’ cap :
A modified guanine nucleotide added to the 5’-end of the pre-mRNA; crucial for recognition and proper attachment of the mRNA to the ribosome.
alternative splicing :
Process by which pre-mRNA messages can be spliced in several different configurations, allowing a single gene to encode multiple proteins.
editing :
The process of changing the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA to allow the mRNA to produce multiple proteins.
exon :
The region of a gene that contains the code for producing a protein.
intron :
Long region of DNA that has no identified function; separates exons.
lariat :
