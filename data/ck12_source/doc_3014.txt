It is an inverse relationship.
In an inverse relationship, when one variable increases, the other variable decreases.
The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate when a given force is applied.
For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration for the same amount of force.
Q :
Tony has greater mass than the other two boys he is racing (pictured in the opening image).
How will this affect his acceleration around the track?
A :
Tony’s greater mass will result in less acceleration for the same amount of force.
Newton’s second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object’s mass.
According to the second law, there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration and an inverse relationship between mass and acceleration.
State Newton’s second law of motion.
How can Newton’s second law of motion be represented with an equation?
If the net force acting on an object doubles, how will the object’s acceleration be affected?
Tony has a mass of 50 kg, and his friend Sam has a mass of 45 kg.
Assume that both friends push off on their rollerblades with the same force.
Explain which boy will have greater acceleration.
