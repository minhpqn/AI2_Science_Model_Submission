Autotrophic organisms use carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as their only source or their main source of carbon.
Many autotrophic bacteria are photosynthetic, and get their carbon from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Energy metabolism in prokaryotes is classified as one of the following:
Phototrophic organisms capture light energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy inside their cells.
Chemotrophic organisms break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell.
Some chemotrophic organisms can also use their organic energy-supplying molecules as a carbon supply, which would make them chemoheterotrophs.
Photoheterotrophs are organisms that capture light energy to convert to chemical energy in the cells, but they get carbon from organic sources (other organisms).
Examples are purple non-sulfur bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria and heliobacteria.
Chemoheterotrophs are organisms that get their energy source and carbon source from organic sources.
Chemoheterotrophs must consume organic building blocks that they are unable to make themselves.
Most get their energy from organic molecules such as sugars.
This nutritional mode is very common among eukaryotes, including humans.
Photoautotrophs are cells that capture light energy, and use carbon dioxide as their carbon source.
There are many photoautotrophic prokaryotes, which include cyanobacteria.
Photoautotrophic prokaryotes use similar compounds to those of plants to trap light energy.
Chemoautotrophs are cells that break down inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell, and use carbon dioxide as a carbon source.
Chemoautotrophs include prokaryotes that break down hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S the “rotten egg” smelling gas), and ammonia (NH 4 ).
Nitrosomonas , a species of soil bacterium, oxidizes NH 4 + to nitrite (NO 2 - ).
This reaction releases energy that the bacteria use.
Many chemoautotrophs also live in extreme environments such as deep sea vents.
