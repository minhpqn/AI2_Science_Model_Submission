Salamanders are found in most moist or arid habitats in the Northern Hemisphere, but can also be found south of the equator.
They live on all continents except Antarctica and Australia.
Salamanders live in or near water or on moist ground, often in a swamp.
Some species live in water most of their life, some live their entire adult life on land, and some live in both habitats.
Some salamanders live in caves.
These salamanders have pale skin and reduced eyes as they have adapted to living in complete darkness in underground pools of water.
The reduced eyes are similar to other organisms that live in caves or underground.
Salamanders are carnivorous , eating only other animals, not plants.
They will eat almost any smaller animal, such as worms, centipedes, crickets, spiders, and slugs.
Some will even eat small invertebrates.
Finally, salamanders have the ability to grow back lost limbs, as well as other body parts.
This process is known as regeneration.
Salamanders have developed ways not to be eaten.
Most salamanders have brightly colored, poisonous skin.
The bold color tells predators not to eat the salamander.
Many salamanders have glands on the back of the neck or on the tail that give off a poisonous or bad-tasting liquid.
Some species can even shed their tail during an attack and grow a new one later.
Some salamanders stand high on its legs and waves its tail to scare away danger.
One particular salamander, the ribbed newt, has needle-like rib tips.
It can squeeze its muscles to make the rib tips pierce through its skin and into its enemy, telling the predator to stay away, a feature unique among the animal kingdom.
