Then it travels to the body's organs and tissues.
The tissues and organs absorb the oxygen through the capillaries.
Oxygen-poor blood is collected from the tissues and organs by tiny veins, which then flow into bigger veins, and, eventually, into the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava.
This completes systemic circulation.
The blood releases carbon dioxide and gets more oxygen in pulmonary circulation before returning to systemic circulation.
The inferior vena cava returns blood from the body.
The superior vena cava returns blood from the head.
Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins return blood to the heart.
Pulmonary circulation carries blood between the heart and lungs, while systemic circulation carries blood between the heart and body.
