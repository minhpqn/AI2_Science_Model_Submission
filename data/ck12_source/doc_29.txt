Some organisms reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction ), especially single-celled organisms, and make identical copies (or clones) of themselves.
Other organisms reproduce sexually ( sexual reproduction ), combining genetic information from two parents to make genetically unique offspring.
Like all living things, cats reproduce to make a new generation of cats

Living Things Maintain Stable Internal Conditions
When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm?
You shiver to warm up your body.
When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat.
When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return to normal.
In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment.
Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis .
Like us, many animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature.
A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm ( Figure below ).

Living things are called organisms.
All living organisms need energy to carry out life processes, are composed of one or more cells, respond to their environment, grow, reproduce, and maintain a stable internal environment.
