Now the mass on the spring has been replaced by a mass that is twice the rotating mass.
Also, the distance between the rotating mass and the pivot has been changed to 1.5 m.
What velocity will keep the period the same now?

Describe the harmonic motion of a pendulum and calculate its period.
Students will learn about the harmonic motion of a pendulum and how to calculate its period.
T_{\text{pendulum}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} ;
Period of a pendulum of length L
In harmonic motion there is always a restorative force , which acts in the opposite direction of the velocity.
The restorative force changes during oscillation and depends on the position of the object.
In a pendulum it is the component of gravity along the path of motion.
The force on the oscillating object is directly opposite that of the direction of velocity.
For pendulums, the period gets larger as the length of the pendulum increases.
You have a mass swinging on the end of 1 m pendulum.
If the maximum linear velocity of the mass is 2 m/s, (a) calculate the period of the pendulum and (b) calculate the amplitude of the pendulum.
To calculate the period of the pendulum, we can just plug in the given length into the equation above.
To find the amplitude, we'll use the equation given in the Period and Frequency lesson that gives us the velocity as a function of time.
Since the problem says that the given velocity is the maximum velocity, we know that the pendulum is at the bottom of it's arc and 1/4th (or 3/4th's) of it's way through one period.
Based on this knowledge, we can plug in 1/4 of the period for the change in time.
