A gas produced in a chemical reaction can be collected by water displacement.
Because the gas is collected over water, it is not pure but is mixed with vapor from the evaporation of the water.
Dalton’s law can be used to calculate the amount of the desired gas by subtracting the contribution of the water vapor.
P_{\text{Total}} &=P_g+P_{H_2 O} \qquad P_g \text{ is the pressure of the desired gas}\\P_g &=P_{\text{Total}}- P_{H_2 O}
In order to solve a problem, it is necessary to know the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the reaction (see Table below ).
The sample problem illustrates the use of Dalton’s law when a gas is collected over water.

Sample Problem:
Gas Collected by Water Displacement
A certain experiment generates 2.58 L of hydrogen gas, which is collected over water.
The temperature is 20°C and the atmospheric pressure is 98.60 kPa.
Find the volume that the dry hydrogen would occupy at STP.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
V_{\text{Total}} =2.58 \text{ L}
T=20^ \circ \text{C}=293 \text{ K}
P_{\text{Total}} =98.60 \text{ kPa}=739.7 \text{ mmHg}
V_{H_2} \ \text{at} \ STP= ? \text{ L}
The atmospheric pressure is converted from kPa to mmHg in order to match units with the table.
The sum of the pressures of the hydrogen and the water vapor is equal to the atmospheric pressure.
