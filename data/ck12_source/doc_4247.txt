The Masai Mara Wildebeest Migration.
The annual wildebeest migration in Kenya and Tanzania is arguably the most spectacular natural event in Africa.
More than 3 million large mammals have made the vast Masai Mara and Serengeti plains their home, and each summer they migrate, looking for greener pastures.
And yes, some call it "the seventh greatest wonder in the world."
Many animal behaviors occur in a regular cycle.
Two types of cyclic behaviors are circadian rhythms and migration.
Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle.
In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day.
Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well.
Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too.
Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside.
In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock .
This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain.
The biological clock sends signals to the body.
The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes.
The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock.
The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.
Migration refers to seasonal movements of animals from one area to another.
Migrants typically travel long distances, and travel the same paths each seasonal cycle.
Usually, the migrants move to another area in order to find food or mates.
