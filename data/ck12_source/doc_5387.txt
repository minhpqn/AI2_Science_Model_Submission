mutated codon is a premature stop codon
CAA (glutamine) → UAA (stop)
These mutations may result in a protein with the same function, with altered function, or with no function.
Silent mutations , as they code for the same amino acid, will have no altered effect on the protein.
Missense mutations may have a minor effect or a dramatic effect on the protein.
Nonsense mutations usually have the most dramatic effet.
Depending on the position of the premature stop codon, nonsense mutations may result in an unstable mRNA that cannot be translated, or in a truncated mRNA and a much "smaller" protein without any significant activity.
Deletions and Insertions
Similar to chromosomal alteration mutations, deletion or insertion mutations add or remove genetic information.
Small deletions or insertions in the DNA will alter the reading frame.
Deletions remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA, whereas insertions add one or more nucleotides into the DNA.
These mutations in the coding region of a gene may also alter the splicing of the mRNA, known as a splice site mutation .
Mutations which alter the reading frame are known as frameshift mutations .
Splice site mutations and frameshift mutations both can dramatically change the mRNA, altering the final protein product.
Consider the following sequence of bases in RNA:
AUG-AAU-ACG-GCU which is translated into start-asparagine-threonine-alanine.
Now, assume an insertion occurs in this sequence.
Let’s say an A nucleotide is inserted after the start codon AUG :
AUG-AAA-UAC-GGC-U is now translated into start-lysine-tyrosine-glycine.
Even though the rest of the sequence is unchanged, this insertion changes the reading frame and thus all of the codons that follow it.
