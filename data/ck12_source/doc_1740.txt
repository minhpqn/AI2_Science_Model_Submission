The microclimate of a valley may be cool relative to its surroundings since cold air sinks.
The ground surface may be hotter or colder than the air a few feet above it.
This is because rock and soil gain and lose heat readily.
Different sides of a mountain will have different microclimates.
In the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing slope receives more solar energy than a north-facing slope.
Each side supports different amounts and types of vegetation.
Altitude and latitude produce similar climate zones and life zones.
A biome is a climate zone and the plants and animals that live in it.
