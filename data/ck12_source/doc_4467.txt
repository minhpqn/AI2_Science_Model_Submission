Benign tumors remain localized and generally do not harm health.
Malignant tumors are cancerous.
There are no limits to their growth, so they can invade and damage neighboring tissues.
Cells from malignant tumors may also break away from the tumor and enter the bloodstream.
They are carried to other parts of the body, where new tumors may form.
The most common and the most deadly cancers for U.S. adults are listed in Table below
Most Common Types of Cancer after Skin Cancer (% of all cancers)
Most Common Causes of Cancer Deaths (% of all cancer deaths)
prostate cancer (33%), lung cancer (13%)
lung cancer (31%), prostate cancer (10%)
breast cancer (32%), lung cancer (12%)
lung cancer (27%), breast cancer (15%)
More cancer deaths in adult males and females are due to lung cancer than any other type of cancer.
Lung cancer is most often caused by exposure to tobacco smoke.
What might explain why lung cancer causes the most cancer deaths when it isnâ€™t the most common type of cancer?
Cancer Treatment and Prevention
Most cancers can be treated, and some can be cured.
The general goal of treatment is to remove the tumor without damaging other cells.
A cancer patient is typically treated in more than one way.
Possible treatments include surgery, drugs ( chemotherapy ), and radiation.
