Linus Pauling, two-time Nobel Prize Winner
You can’t win them all.
Linus Pauling was one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century.
A two-time Nobel Prize winner (in chemistry in 1954 and the peace prize in 1962).
However, he didn’t always come in first.
In the 1950s, there was a great deal of interest in the structure of DNA.
Pauling spent some time on this puzzle, although he was primarily interested in proteins.
The inadequate amount of information he had led him to propose a DNA structure where the bases were on the outside and the phosphate groups were on the inside.
