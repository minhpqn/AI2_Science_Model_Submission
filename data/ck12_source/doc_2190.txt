The Hubble Space Telescope took this incredible photo of Mars.
This is a true color photo: the red is soil, the white is the polar ice cap, the dark is basalt.
Mars has many features like Earth's, but Mars is missing one very important feature: an ocean.
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun.
The Red Planet is the first planet beyond Earth’s orbit.
Mars’ atmosphere is thin compared to Earth's.
This means that there is much lower pressure at the surface.
Mars also has a weak greenhouse effect, so temperatures are only slightly higher than they would be if the planet did not have an atmosphere.
The Martian climate is most like Earth's of any planet in the solar system.
Mars is the easiest planet to observe.
As a result, it has been studied more than any other planet besides Earth.
People can stand on Earth and observe the planet through a telescope.
We have also sent many space probes to Mars.
A car-sized robotic rover, Curiosity, arrived on the Red Planet in August 2012.
Curiosity joins Opportunity, which has been active since 2004.
No humans have ever set foot on Mars.
NASA and the European Space Agency have plans to send people to Mars.
The goal is to do it sometime between 2030 and 2040.
The expense and danger of these missions are phenomenal.
