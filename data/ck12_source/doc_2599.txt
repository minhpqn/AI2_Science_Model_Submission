Why does boron act chemically like a metal?
Why do arsenic, antimony, and tellurium tend to have chemical properties similar to nonmetals?
Sometimes silicon and germanium behave like metals, and sometimes they behave like nonmetals.
Explain why.
Which elements in groups 13–16 are metalloids?
Name two physical properties that boron shares with most metals.
What property of the metalloid silicon makes it useful for computer chips?
A recent investigation found relatively high levels of the metalloid arsenic in samples of apple juice.
Why might this be a serious problem?
Why is the metalloid tellurium used to make solar panels?
Describe physical and chemical properties of halogens.
List some uses of halogens.
You’ve probably seen halogen lights like the ones pictured here.
You may even have halogen lights in your home.
If you do, you may have noticed that they get really hot and give off a lot of light for their size.
A halogen light differs from a regular incandescent light bulb in having a small amount of halogen gas inside the bulb.
The gas combines chemically with the metal in the filament, and this extends the life of the filament.
It allows the lamp to get hotter and give off more light than a regular incandescent light without burning out quickly.
What is halogen gas, and which elements are halogens?
In this article, you’ll find out.
