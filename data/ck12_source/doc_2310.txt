Women and People of Color in Science
Explain why there are relatively few women and people of color in science.
Identify several contributions to physical science made by women or people of color.
This woman is playing a flute in what appears to be a cockpit.
But why are her feet strapped to the floor?
And why is her hair standing on end?
The woman in the photo is astronaut Ellen Ochoa, Ph.D., and she’s playing her flute aboard the space shuttle Discovery .
The straps prevent her from floating into the air in the zero-gravity ship.
The lack of gravity also explains her hairdo.
In addition to being an astronaut who has flown several space missions, Dr.
Ochoa is a leading research scientist and an inventor with several patents to her credit.
Biases Against Women and People of Color
Dr.
Ochoa is one of just a few dozen female astronauts in the U.S.
She is also the first Hispanic woman in the world to go into space.
Although females make up more than half of the U.S. population, fewer than 25 percent of U.S. astronauts are women.
