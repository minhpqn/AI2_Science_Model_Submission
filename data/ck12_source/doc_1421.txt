Water shortages are common in much of the world.
People are most likely to run short of water during droughts.
A drought is a period of unusually low rainfall.
Human actions have increased how often droughts occur.
One way people can help to bring on a drought is by cutting down trees.
Trees add a lot of water vapor to the air.
With fewer trees, the air is drier and droughts are more common.
We already use six times as much water today as we did a hundred years ago.
As the number of people rises, our need for water will grow.
By the year 2025, only half the worldâ€™s people will have enough clean water.
Water is such a vital resource that serious water shortages may cause other problems.
Crops and livestock may die, so people will have less food available.
Other uses of water, such as industry, may have to stop.
This reduces the jobs people can get and the products they can buy.
People and nations may fight over water resources.
In extreme cases, people may die from lack of water.
The Figure below shows the global water situation in the 2030s with water stress and water scarcity on the map.
Blues indicate no predicted water stress; pinks and lavenders predict water stress, and salmon to brown indicates water scarcity (variations of those colors indicate the amount of irrigation that will be done to produce crops).
Fresh water is not evenly distributed across the planet.
Many of the world's people live without access to enough clean water.
