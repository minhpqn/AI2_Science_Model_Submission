Oceans and Climate
When a place is near an ocean, the water can have a big effect on the climate.
Coastal and Inland Climates
Places at the same latitude may have very different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland.
On the coast, the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean.
A coastal climate is usually mild.
Summers aren’t too hot, and winters aren’t too cold.
Precipitation can be high due to the moisture in the air.
This is a maritime climate .
Farther inland, the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from the land.
This air may be dry, because it comes from over land.
An inland climate is usually more extreme.
Winters may be very cold, and summers may be very hot.
Precipitation can be low.
This is a continental climate .
The Influence of the Ocean
The ocean has a big effect on climate.
This is obvious when you compare the temperatures of these three cities.
Each of these cities is located at 37°N latitude, within the westerly winds ( Figure below
