For diverging mirrors, there is no true focal point (i.e. real light does not focus), so the focal length is negative.
When light rays converge in front of a mirror, a real image is formed.
Real images are useful in that you can place photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a photograph.
When light rays diverge in front of a mirror, a virtual image is formed.
A virtual image is formed by your brain tracing diverging rays backwards and is kind of a trick, like the person you see “behind” a mirror’s surface when you brush your teeth (there's obviously no real light focused behind a mirror!).
Since virtual images aren’t actually “anywhere,” you can’t place photographic film anywhere to capture them.
Real images are upside-down, or inverted .
You can make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a mirror or lens than the focal length.
Virtual images are typically right-side-up.
You can make virtual images by moving the mirror or lens closer to the object than the focal length.
In the problems below that consider converging or diverging mirrors, you will do a careful ray tracing with a ruler (including the extrapolation of rays for virtual images).
It is best if you can use different colors for the three different ray tracings.
When sketching diverging rays, you should use dotted lines for the extrapolated lines behind a mirror in order to produce the virtual image.
When comparing measured distances and heights to calculated distances and heights, values within 10 % are considered “good.” Use the Table ( below ) as your guide.

Ray #1:
Leaves tip of candle, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects back through focus.
Ray #2:
Leaves tip, travels through focus, reflects back parallel to optic axis.
Ray #3:
