It is found in the nucleus.
It has an electrical charge of one +1 and a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu).
Atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements.
Protons consist of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.
Gluons carry the strong nuclear force between quarks, binding them together.

What is the relationship between protons and elements?
Atoms, which are always neutral in electric charge, contain electrons as well as protons and neutrons.
An electron has an electrical charge of -1.
If an atom has three electrons, infer how many protons it has.
Identify the fundamental particles that make up a proton.
Explain how isotopes of an element differ from one another.
Identify fundamental particles in neutrons.
The arrow in this photo is pointing to a star that doesn’t look like much compared with some of the other stars in the picture.
It’s certainly much smaller than most other stars.
In fact, it’s only about 20 kilometers in diameter.
Compare that with the 1.4-million-kilometer diameter of our own sun.
Despite its small size, however, this star has greater mass than the sun, making it incredibly dense.
It also has tremendous gravity.
In fact, gravity on its surface is about 2 × 10 11 times the gravity we feel on Earth!
