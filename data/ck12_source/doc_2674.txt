Q:
When it comes to energy, which type of reaction is the burning of wood?
Is it an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction?
How can you tell?
A:
The burning of wood is an exothermic reaction.
You can tell by the heat and light energy given off by a wood fire.
A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances, called reactants, change into different substances, called products.
During the reaction, chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products.
Types of chemical reactions include synthesis, decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions.
All chemical reactions involve energy.
Exothermic reactions release more energy than they use.
Endothermic reactions use more energy than they release.
