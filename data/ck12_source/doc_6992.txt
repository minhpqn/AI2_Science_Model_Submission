For lenses, the distance from the center of the lens to the focus is f .
Focal lengths for foci behind the lens are positive in sign.
The distance from the center of the lens to the object in question is d_0 , where distances to the left of the lens are positive in sign.
The distance from the center of the lens to the image is d_i .
This number is positive for real images (formed to the right of the lens), and negative for virtual images (formed to the left of the lens).
Lenses , made from curved pieces of glass, focus or de-focus light as it passes through.
Lenses that focus light are called converging lenses, and these are the ones used to make telescopes and cameras.
Lenses that de-focus light are called diverging lenses.
Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called images
The focal length , f , of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens to the place where the light is focused.
This is called the focal point or focus .
For diverging lenses, the focal length is negative.
For converging lens, one can find the focal point by simply holding a piece of paper near the lens until a distant image is formed.
The distance from the paper to the lens is the focal point.
When light rays converge behind a lens, a real image is formed.
Real images are useful in that you can place photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a photograph.
When light rays diverge behind a lens, a virtual image is formed.
A virtual image is a manifestation of your brain (it traces the diverging rays backwards and forms an image), like the person you see “behind” a mirror’s surface when you brush your teeth (there's obviously no real light focused behind a mirror!).
Since virtual images aren’t actually “anywhere,” you can’t place photographic film anywhere to capture them.
Real images are upside-down, or inverted .
