Using unbalanced forces to control the motion of a skateboard demonstrates Newton’s first law of motion.
Do you think you understand Newton’s first law?
Go to the URL below to find out.
Review Newton’s law and watch what happens to the skateboarder in the animation.
Then answer the questions at the bottom of the Web page.
State Newton’s first law of motion.
You don’t need to push off with a foot against the ground to start a skateboard rolling down a bank.
Does this violate Newton’s first law of motion?
Why or why not?
Practice problem to help students understand Newton's first law of motion
Nina ran into a rough patch of pavement, but she thought she could ride right over it.
Instead, the skateboard stopped suddenly and Nina ended up on the ground (see Figure above ).
Explain what happened.
Now that you know about Newton’s first law of motion, how might you use it to ride a skateboard more safely?
Describe how inertia affects motion.
State the relationship between inertia and mass.
Explain how to overcome inertia.
At Newton’s Skate Park, Lauren is pushing her twin cousins, Jonathan and Cody, on her skateboard.
She has to push hard to get the skateboard started, but once it begins moving, it takes much less effort to keep it rolling over the smooth, flat pavement.
In fact, if Lauren tries to stop the rolling skateboard, it may take as much effort to stop it as it did to start it rolling in the first place.
