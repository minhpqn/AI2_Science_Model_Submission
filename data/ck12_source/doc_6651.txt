Ant colony searching for food
The ants in this picture belong to the same colony.
They have left the colony’s nest to search for food.

Each bee in the colony has a particular job.
Most of the bees are workers.
Young worker bees clean the colony’s hive and feed the young.
Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive.
The oldest workers leave the hive to find food.
Each colony usually has one queen that lays eggs.
The colony also has a small number of male drones.
They mate with the queen.
