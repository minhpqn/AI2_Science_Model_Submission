Acidity is an important factor for living things because most can survive only within a relatively narrow range of acidity.
Try arranging substances in order by their pH values at the following URL.
What determines how acidic or basic a solution is?
What is pH?
What is the pH of a neutral substance?
How much more acidic is soapy water than pure water? ( Hint :
See the pH chart in the Figure above .)
Why is the pH of the environment important for living things?
Identify the ions produced when acids and bases dissolve in water.
Describe neutralization reactions and the formation of salts.
What is one of the most important characteristics of a referee?
A referee must be neutral.
He can’t favor one team over the other.
In chemistry, being neutral means not being an acid or a base.
Pure water is an example of a neutral substance.
In some chemical reactions, an acid and a base combine to form neutral products, including water.
You’ll see how this happens when you read this article.
Acids, Bases, and Ions
An acid is a compound that produces positive hydrogen ions (H + ) and negative nonmetal ions when it dissolves in water. (Ions are atoms that have become charged by losing or gaining electrons.) Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is an example of an acid.
When it dissolves in water, it produces positive hydrogen ions and negative chloride ions (Cl - ).
