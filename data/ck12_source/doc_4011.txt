Where did viruses come from?
How did the first viruses arise?
The answers to these questions are not known for certain.
Several hypotheses have been proposed.
The two main hypotheses are stated below.
Both may be valid and explain the origin of different viruses.
Small viruses started as runaway pieces of nucleic acid that originally came from living cells such as bacteria.
Large viruses were once parasitic cells inside bigger host cells.
Over time, genes needed to survive and reproduce outside host cells were lost.
Viruses were assumed to exist before they were first seen with an electron microscope in the 1930s.
Multiple hypotheses for viral origins have been proposed.
