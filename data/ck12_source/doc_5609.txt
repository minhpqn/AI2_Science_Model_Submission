Logs floating in a river
How do logs stay afloat in water?
After trees are cut, logging companies often move these materials down a river to a sawmill where they can be shaped into building materials or other products.  The logs float on the water because they are less dense than the water they are in.  Knowledge of density is important in the characterization and separation of materials.  Information about density allows us to make predictions about the behavior of matter.
A golf ball and a table tennis ball are about the same size.
However, the golf ball is much heavier than the table tennis ball.
Now imagine a similar size ball made out of lead.
That would be very heavy indeed!
