Photons travel in waves.
These waves make up electromagnetic radiation .
The image below models a wave of light ( Figure below ).
Notice the wavelength in the figure.
Waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy.
Diagram of a wave
This curve models a wave.
Based on this figure, how would you define wavelength?
Energy from the Sun has a wide range of wavelengths.
The total range of energy is called the electromagnetic spectrum ( Figure below ).
The electromagnetic spectrum
Compare the wavelengths of radio waves and gamma rays.
Which type of wave has more energy?
Visible light is the only light that humans can see.
Different wavelengths of visible light appear as different colors.
Radio waves have the longest wavelengths.
They also have the least amount of energy.
Infrared light has wavelengths too long for humans to see, but we can feel them as heat.
The atmosphere absorbs the infrared light.
Ultraviolet (UV) light is in wavelengths too short for humans to see.
