Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks.
Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally.
Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising.
The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is called convection .
Convection cells in the Earth
The rising and sinking of mantle material of different temperatures and densities creates a convection cell.
The mantle is composed of solid peridotite.
Conduction from the core heats the lower mantle.
Mantle convection bring hot material up toward the surface.
It brings cooler material down toward the core.
