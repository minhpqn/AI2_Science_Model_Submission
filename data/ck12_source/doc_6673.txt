Since 1 in. is equal to 2.54 cm, then 1 = {\frac{2.54 \;\mathrm{cm}}{1 \;\mathrm{in}}} = {\frac{1 \;\mathrm{in}}{2.54 \;\mathrm{cm}}} .
Thus, one can multiply by this form of 1 in order to cancel units (see video below).
Write out every step and show all your units cancelling as you go.
When converting speeds from metric to American units, remember the following rule of thumb: a speed measured in mi/hr is about double the value measured in m/s ( i.e., 10 \mathrm{m/s} is equal to about 20 MPH).
Remember that the speed itself hasn’t changed, just our representation of the speed in a certain set of units.
When you’re not sure how to approach a problem, you can often get insight by considering how to obtain the units of the desired result by combining the units of the given variables.
For instance, if you are given a distance (in meters) and a time (in hours), the only way to obtain units of speed (meters/hour) is to divide the distance by the time.
This is a simple example of a method called dimensional analysis , which can be used to find equations that govern various physical situations without any knowledge of the phenomena themselves.
Question : 20 m/s = ? mi/hr
20 m/s (1 mi/1600 m) = .0125 mi/s
.0125 mi/s (60 s/min) = .75 mi/min
.75 mi/min (60 min/hr) = 45 mi/hr
