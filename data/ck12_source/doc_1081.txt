This is called the Mercator projection.
Imagine wrapping the round, ball-shaped Earth with a big, flat piece of paper.
First you make a tube or a cylinder.
The cylinder touches Earth at the Equator.
The poles are the farthest points from the cylinder.
Now shine a light from the inside of your model Earth out to the cylinder.
The image projected onto the paper is a Mercator projection.
Where does the projection represent Earth best?
Where is it worst?
Your map would be most correct at the Equator.
The shapes and sizes of continents become more stretched out near the poles.
Early sailors and navigators found the Mercator map useful because most explorations were located near the Equator.
Many world maps still use the Mercator projection.
A Mercator projection translates the curved surface of Earth onto a cylinder
A Mercator projection translates the curved surface of Earth onto a cylinder.
The Mercator projection is best within 15Â° north or south of the Equator.
Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape.
The further the feature is from the Equator, the more out of shape it is stretched.
For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole.
But look at the Mercator projection above.
