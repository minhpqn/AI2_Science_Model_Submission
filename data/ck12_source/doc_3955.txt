In humans, air pollution causes respiratory and cardiovascular problems.
In fact, more people die each year from air pollution than automobile accidents.
Air pollution also affects ecosystems worldwide by causing acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming.
Ways to reduce air pollution from fossil fuels include switching to nonpolluting energy sources (such as solar energy) and using less energy.
What are some ways you could use less energy?
All life relies on a relatively narrow range of pH, or acidity.
Thatâ€™s because protein structure and function are very sensitive to pH.
Air pollution can cause precipitation to become acidic.
Nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mainly from motor vehicle exhaust and coal burning, create acids when they combine with water in the air.
The acids lower the pH of precipitation, forming acid rain .
If acid rain falls on the ground, it may damage soil and soil organisms.
If it falls on plants, it may kill them (see Figure below ).
If it falls into lakes, it lowers the pH of the water and kills aquatic organisms.
