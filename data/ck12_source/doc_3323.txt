The blueprints include circuit diagrams.
The diagrams show how the wiring and other electrical components are to be installed in order to supply current to appliances, lights, and other electric devices.
You can see an example of a very simple circuit in the Figure below .
Different parts of the circuit are represented by standard circuit symbols.
An ammeter measures the flow of current through the circuit, and a voltmeter measures the voltage.
A resistor is any device that converts some of the electricity to other forms of energy.
For example, a resistor might be a light bulb or doorbell.
Circuit diagrams utilize a standard set of symbols to represent circuits
The circuit diagram in the middle represents the circuit drawing on the left.
On the right are some of the standard symbols used in circuit diagrams.
Q:
Only one of the circuit symbols in the Figure above must be included in every circuit.
Which symbol is it?
A:
The battery symbol (or a symbol for some other voltage source) must be included in every circuit.
Without a source of voltage, there is no electric current.
An electric circuit is a closed loop through which current can flow.
All electric circuits must have a voltage source, such as a battery, and a conductor, which is usually wire.
They may have one or more electric devices as well.
An electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram, which uses standard symbols to represent the parts of the circuit.
