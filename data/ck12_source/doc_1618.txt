Diagram of diffusion across a cell membrane
Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of a higher amount toward an area of lower amount.
A concentration gradient initially exists across the cell membrane.
Equilibrium is reached when there is an equal amount of the substance on both sides of the membrane.
The diffusion of water across a membrane because of a difference in concentration is called osmosis .
Let's explore three different situations and analyze the flow of water.
A hypotonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has a lower concentration of dissolved material than the inside of the cell.
If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will move into the cell.
This causes the cell to swell, and it may even burst.
A hypertonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has more dissolved material than inside of the cell.
If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water will leave the cell.
This can cause a cell to shrink and shrivel.
An isotonic solution is a solution in which the amount of dissolved material is equal both inside and outside of the cell.
Water still flows in both directions, but an equal amount enters and leaves the cell.
Applications of Osmosis
How do marine animals keep their cells from shrinking?
How do you keep your blood cells from bursting?
Both of these questions have to do with the cell membrane and osmosis.
Marine animals live in salt water, which is a hypertonic environment; there is more salt in the water than in their cells.
To prevent losing too much water from their bodies, these animals intake large quantities of salt water and then secrete the excess salt.
