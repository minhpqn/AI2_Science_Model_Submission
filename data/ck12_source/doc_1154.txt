How do scientists know that Earth's interior contains metal?
What do meteorites tell us about Earth's interior?
How do scientists use seismic waves to learn about Earth's interior?
Earth's Outer Layers
Identify Earth's layers and describe their characteristics.
Does this look familiar?
Gases, water, rock, and living organisms are all found at Earth's surface.
These materials are also found above or below the surface.
They interact with each other and in doing so alter each other.
For example, the hydrosphere may cause some of the lithosphere to wash away.
Earth is made of layers.
Since Earth is round, the layers all have the ending "-sphere" ( Figure below ).
Some of the different parts of the Earth are the:
Atmosphere :
The thin layer of air, mostly nitrogen and oxygen, that surrounds the Earth.
Hydrosphere :
All the water on Earth.
Biosphere :
