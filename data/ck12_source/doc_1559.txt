The air on a mountain slope warms more than the air over the nearby valley.
The warm air rises and brings cool air up from below.
This is a valley breeze .
At night the mountain slope cools more than the air over the valley.
The air flows downhill creating a mountain breeze .
Katabatic winds move the same way as mountain and valley breezes.
However, they are much stronger.
Katabatic winds form over a high plateau that is surrounded by mountains.
In winter, the plateau grows cold.
Air sinks through the gaps in the mountains.
Over Antarctica and Greenland, these winds are frigid.
Chinook winds ( Figure below ) occur when air is forced over a mountain range.
Warm air rises over the Sierra Nevada in California, for example, because it is pushed eastward by the westerly winds.
The air cools as it rises and precipitates.
The air is now dry.
It sinks down the far side of the mountains and may create strong winds.
These Chinook winds are relatively warm.
If there is snow, the winds may melt it quickly.
The dry sinking air creates a rainshadow effect .
Rainshadow effect is responsible for many of the world's deserts.
