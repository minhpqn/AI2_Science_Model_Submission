Go golfing on a July Sunday at around 4 pm, especially in Florida.
The golf club up in the air acts as a lightning rod.
The late afternoon in July is a great time for thunderstorms.
Florida is prone to thunderstorms, and Sunday is a day on which a lot of people like to golf.
In other words, don't do these things!
Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning.
In strong thunderstorms, hail and high winds are also likely.
Thunderstorms are very common.
Worldwide, there are about 14 million of them each year!
In the U.S., they are most common—and strongest—in the Midwest.
Thunderstorms form when the ground is really hot ( Figure below ).
The air near the ground becomes very warm and humid.
This is true in some locations in late afternoon or early evening in spring and summer.
The warm air rises rapidly, which creates strong updrafts.
When the rising air cools, its water vapor condenses.
The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds.
Winds blow the cloud top sideways.
This makes the well-known anvil shape of a cloud known as a thunderhead ( Figure below ).
Water droplets and ice fly up through the cloud.
When these droplets get heavy enough, they fall.
