Thermochemistry is the study of energy changes that occur during chemical reactions and during changes of state.  When chemical reactions occur, some chemical bonds are broken, while new chemical bonds form.
As a result of the rearrangement of atoms, the total chemical potential energy of the system either increases or decreases.
Heat is transferred energy from a site of higher energy to a site of lower energy.
