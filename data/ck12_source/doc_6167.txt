What affects the Henry’s law constant?
What do you need to be careful of in the way of units?
If we know the atmospheric pressure and the mole fraction of the gas, how do we calculate the partial pressure of the gas?
Does pressure affect the solubility of liquids and solids?
If you increase the pressure of a gas above the liquid, how does that affect the amount of gas dissolved in the liquid?
What equilibrium is eventually reached?
Henry’s Law:
The solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.
Perform calculations involving mass percent and volume percent solutions.
The words dilute and concentrated are relative terms that can be vague
How many is too much?
There are cultures that have no numbers above three.
Anything greater than that is simply referred to as “much” or “many”.
We recognize how limited this form of calculation is, but we do some of the same thing.
There are several ways to express the amount of solute in a solution in a quantitative manner.
The concentration of a solution is a measure of the amount of solute that has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent or solution.
A concentrated solution is one that has a relatively large amount of dissolved solute.
A dilute solution is one that has a relatively small amount of dissolved solute.
However, those terms are vague and we need to be able to express concentration with numbers.
