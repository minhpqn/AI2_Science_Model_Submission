For sodium nitride, the sodium ion is Na + , while the nitride ion is N 3- .
In order to make a neutral compound, three of the 1+ sodium ions are required in order to balance out the single 3− nitride ion.
So the Na is given a subscript of 3.
For calcium phosphide, the calcium ion is Ca 2+ , while the phosphide ion is P 3- .
The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6.
To make the compound neutral, three calcium ions have a total charge of 6+, while two phosphide ions have a total charge of 6−.
The Ca is given a subscript of 3, while the P is given a subscript of 2.
A binary ionic compound is a compound composed of a monatomic metal cation and a monatomic nonmetal anion.
The metal part of the compound is named as the element.
The non-metallic part of the compound is named by dropping the end of the element and adding –ide.
For binary compounds, it is not necessary to indicate the number of ions in the compound .
