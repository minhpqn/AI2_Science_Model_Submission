You've probably heard of vacuum tubes and large transistors, which were once common in electronics like televisions.
These individual devices were mounted on large printed circuit boards.
Then, in 1959, two researchers working independently developed the first integrated circuits.
These circuits could combine several transistors and resistors into one circuit on one small chip of silicon.
These chips, like the one pictured above, are used today in virtually every electrical device.
Electric Current and Circuits
Remember that it often requires work to force electrons into a specific location.
If we have two conducting spheres and we have forced excess electrons onto one of the spheres by doing work on the electrons, then that sphere, and those electrons, will have a higher potential energy than those on the uncharged sphere.
If the two spheres are touched together, electrons will flow from the sphere with excess electrons to the sphere with no excess electrons.
That is, electrons will flow from the high potential energy position to the lower potential energy position.
The flow will continue until the electrons on the two spheres have the same potential energy.
A flow of charged particles such as this is called an electric current.
It is possible for an electric current to be either a flow of positively charged particles or negatively charged particles.
