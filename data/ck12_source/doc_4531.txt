The steroid hormone and receptor form a complex that moves into the nucleus and influences the expression of genes, essentially acting as a transcription factor.
Examples of steroid hormones include cortisol and sex hormones.
A steroid hormone crosses the plasma membrane of a target cell and binds with a receptor inside the cell.
Non-steroid hormones are made of amino acids.
They are not fat soluble, so they cannot diffuse across the plasma membrane of target cells.
Instead, a non-steroid hormone binds to a receptor on the cell membrane (see Figure below ).
The binding of the hormone triggers an enzyme inside the cell membrane.
The enzyme activates another molecule, called the second messenger , which influences processes inside the cell.
Most endocrine hormones are non-steroid hormones, including insulin and thyroid hormones.
A non-steroid hormone binds with a receptor on the plasma membrane of a target cell.
Then, a secondary messenger affects cell processes.
Hormones work by binding to protein receptors either inside target cells or on their plasma membranes.
The binding of a steroid hormone forms a hormone-receptor complex that affects gene expression in the nucleus of the target cell.
The binding of a non-steroid hormone activates a second messenger that affects processes within the target cell.
