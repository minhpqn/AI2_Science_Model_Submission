A locust eats its own weight in plants every day.
Just imagine eating your own weight in food every day.
You probably couldn't.
You would most likely get very sick even if you tried.
How do Insects Eat?
Insects eat in many different ways and they eat a huge range of foods.
Around half are plant-eaters, feeding on leaves, roots, seeds, nectar, or wood.
Aphids and leafhoppers suck up the sap from plants.
Praying mantises are predators, hunting other small creatures, including insects like moths, caterpillars, flies, beetles, and spiders.
Insects like mosquitoes and aphids have special mouthparts that help them pierce and suck.
Others, like assassin bugs ( Figure below ) and certain species of female mosquitoes, eat other insects.
Fleas and lice are parasites, eating the flesh or blood of larger animals without killing them.
Insects have different types of appendages (arms and legs) adapted for capturing and feeding on prey.
They also have special senses that help them detect prey.
Furthermore, insects have a wide range of mouthparts used for feeding.

Examples of chewing insects include dragonflies, grasshoppers, and beetles.
These insects use one pair of jaws to bite off bits of food and grind them down.
Another pair of jaws helps to push the food down the throat.
