Water is a liquid over a wide range of standard temperatures and pressures.
However, water can also occur as a solid (ice) or gas (water vapor).
Where Is All the Water?
Of all the water on Earth, about two percent is stored underground in spaces between rocks.
A fraction of a percent exists in the air as water vapor, clouds, or precipitation.
Another fraction of a percent occurs in the bodies of plants and animals.
So where is most of Earth’s water?
It’s on the surface of the planet.
In fact, water covers about 70 percent of Earth’s surface.
Of water on Earth’s surface, 97 percent is salt water, mainly in the ocean.
Only 3 percent is fresh water .
Most of the fresh water is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps.
The remaining fresh water occurs in rivers, lakes, and other fresh water features.
Most of the water on Earth consists of saltwater in the oceans.
What percent of Earth’s water is fresh water?
Where is most of the fresh water found?
Although clean fresh water is essential to human life, in many parts of the world it is in short supply.
The amount of fresh water is not the issue.
There is plenty of fresh water to go around, because water constantly recycles on Earth.
However, fresh water is not necessarily located where it is needed, and clean fresh water is not always available.
