It follows that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas present in the sample.
Avogadro’s law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas when the temperature and pressure are held constant.
The mathematical expression of Avogadro’s law is
V=k \times n \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{V_1}{n_1}=\frac{V_2}{n_2}
where  n is the number of moles of gas and  k is a constant.
Avogadro’s law is in evidence whenever you blow up a balloon.
The volume of the balloon increases as you add moles of gas to the balloon by blowing it up.
If the container holding the gas is rigid rather than flexible, pressure can be substituted for volume in Avogadro’s law.
Adding gas to a rigid container makes the pressure increase.
Sample Problem:
Avogadro’s Law
A balloon has been filled to a volume of 1.90 L with 0.0920 mol of helium gas.
If 0.0210 mol of additional helium is added to the balloon while the temperature and pressure are held constant, what is the new volume of the balloon?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
V_1=1.90 \text{ L}
n_1=0.0920 \text{ mol}
n_2=0.0920+0.0210=0.1130 \text{ mol}
V_2=? \text{ L}
Note that the final number of moles has to be calculated by adding the original number of moles to the moles of added helium.
