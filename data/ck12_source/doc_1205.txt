Can you tell what's different?
Igneous rocks cool from magma.
The appearance of the rock is created by the composition of the magma.
It is also determined by the rate that the magma cools.
If the magma cools deep underground, it cools slowly.
If the magma cools at or very near the surface, it cools quickly.
This results in two different rock types.
The rock types can be told apart by the size of their crystals.
The size of the crystals creates the texture of the rock.
Intrusive Igneous Rocks
Intrusive igneous rocks cool underground.
Deep in the crust, magma cools slowly.
Slow cooling gives crystals a chance to grow.
Intrusive igneous rocks have relatively large crystals that are easy to see.
Intrusive igneous rocks are also called plutonic.
A pluton is an igneous rock body that forms within the crust.
Granite is the most common intrusive igneous rock.
Pictured below are four types of intrusive rocks ( Figure below ).
Granite, diorite, gabbro, and peridotite are all intrusive igneous rocks
(A) This granite has more plagioclase feldspar than many granites. (B) Diorite has more dark-colored minerals than granite. (C) Gabbro. (D) Peridotite contains olivine and other mafic minerals.
