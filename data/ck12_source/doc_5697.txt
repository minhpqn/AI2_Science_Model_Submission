Bohr proposed that electrons do not radiate energy as they orbit the nucleus, but exist in states of constant energy which he called stationary states .
This means that the electrons orbit at fixed distances from the nucleus (see Figure below ).
Bohr’s work was primarily based on the emission spectra of hydrogen.
This is also referred to as the planetary model of the atom.
It explained the inner workings of the hydrogen atom.
Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922 for his work.

Bohr explained that electrons can be moved into different orbits with the addition of energy.
When the energy is removed, the electrons return back to their ground state, emitting a corresponding amount of energy – a quantum of light, or photon.
This was the basis for what later became known as quantum theory .
This is a theory based on the principle that matter and energy have the properties of both particles and waves.
It accounts for a wide range of physical phenomena, including the existence of discrete packets of energy and matter, the uncertainty principle, and the exclusion principle.
According to the Bohr model, often referred to as a planetary model , the electrons encircle the nucleus of the atom in specific allowable paths called orbits.
When the electron is in one of these orbits, its energy is fixed.
The ground state of the hydrogen atom, where its energy is lowest, is when the electron is in the orbit that is closest to the nucleus.
The orbits that are further from the nucleus are all of successively greater energy.
The electron is not allowed to occupy any of the spaces in between the orbits.
An everyday analogy to the Bohr model is the rungs of a ladder.
As you move up or down a ladder, you can only occupy specific rungs and cannot be in the spaces in between rungs.
