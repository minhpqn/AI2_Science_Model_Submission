The fluid also cushions the internal organs.
The pressure of the fluid within the cavity provides stiffness.
It gives the body internal support, forming a hydrostatic skeleton.
It explains why roundworms are round and flatworms are flat.
Later, a true coelom evolved.
This is a fluid-filled body cavity, completely enclosed by mesoderm.
It lies between the digestive cavity and body wall (see Figure below ).
Invertebrates with a true coelom include mollusks and annelids.

The coelom forms within the mesoderm.
Segmentation evolved next.
This is a division of the body into multiple segments.
Both the earthworm and ant pictured in Figure below have segmented bodies.
This trait increases flexibility.
It permits a wider range of motion.
All annelids and arthropods are segmented.
Arthropods also evolved jointed appendages.
For example, they evolved jointed legs for walking and “feelers” (antennae) for sensing.
