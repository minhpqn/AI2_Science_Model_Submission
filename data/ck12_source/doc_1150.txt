About one week later, the Moon enters the quarter-moon phase.
Only half of the Moonâ€™s lit surface is visible from Earth, so it appears as a half circle.
Another week later, the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun.
The side of the Moon facing Earth is completely dark.
This is called a new moon .
Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky.
This is because some sunlight reflects off the Earth and hits the Moon.
One week after that, the Moon is in another quarter-moon phase.
Finally, in one more week, the Moon is back to full.
Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases.
During the crescent moon phase, the Moon is less than half lit.
It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape.
During the gibbous moon phase, the Moon is more than half lit.
It is not full.
The Moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.
The appearance of the Moon from Earth has distinct phases.
A full moon is completely lit; a new moon is completely dark.
A gibbous moon is more than half lit; a crescent moon is less than half lit.
