The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has.
The smallest alkane is methane.
It has just one carbon atom.
The next largest is ethane with two carbon atoms.
The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the Table below .
The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have.
Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally boil and melt at higher temperatures.

C 5 H 12
C 6 H 14
C 7 H 16
C 8 H 18
Q:
