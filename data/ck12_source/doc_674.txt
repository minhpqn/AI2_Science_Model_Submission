Fundamentals of Light
Describe electromagnetic radiation.
State the speed of light in air.
Use the speed of light to solve problems.
Define luminous, illuminated, transparent, translucent, opaque and polarized.
Understand the difference between color from pigment and color from light.
Prism breaking white light into a rainbow
White light is composed of an infinite number of individual colors.
Your eye blends the colors and your brain “sees” white light.
A prism, such as the one shown above and on Pink Floyd's album cover, is able to resolve the light back into individual colors.

Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum
We only see objects that have light waves that travel from them to our eyes.
Objects either generate light or reflect it.
Light is generated by incandescent and fluorescent lamps, light emitting diodes, flames, very hot objects, and even some animals.  Our major source of light is the sun.  Light is a small fraction of the energy we call electromagnetic radiation.
Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields traveling at the speed of light.
Electromagnetic waves carry this energy from one place to another and are similar to waves in a rope.
Unlike the wave in a rope, however, electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to travel; the most prevalent electromagnetic waves we experience travel through the vacuum of outer space from the sun.
The energy of an electromagnetic wave travels in a straight line along the path of the wave.
The moving light wave has associated with it an oscillating electric field and an oscillating magnetic field.
