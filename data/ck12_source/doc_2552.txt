For example, helium has two electrons, both in the first energy level.
This energy level can hold only two electrons, so helium’s only energy level is full.
This makes helium a very stable element.
In other words, its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms.
Consider the elements fluorine and lithium, modeled in the Figure below .
Fluorine has seven of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level, which is energy level II.
It would be more stable if it had one more electron because this would fill its outermost energy level.
Lithium, on the other hand, has just one of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level (also energy level II).
It would be more stable if it had one less electron because it would have a full outer energy level (now energy level I).
Fluorine and lithium atoms
Both fluorine and lithium are highly reactive elements because of their number of valence electrons.
Fluorine will readily gain one electron and lithium will just as readily give up one electron to become more stable.
In fact, lithium and fluorine will react together as shown in the Figure below .
When the two elements react, lithium transfers its one “extra” electron to fluorine.
