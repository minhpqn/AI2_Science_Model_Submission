Evolving More Complex Structures
Like all reptiles, crocodilians have a relatively small brain, but the crocodilian brain is more advanced than those of other reptiles.
Because of their aquatic habitat, the eyes, ears, and nostrils are all located on the same "face" in a line one after the other.
The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs.
They see well during the day and may even have color vision, and they also have excellent night vision.
A third transparent eyelid, the nictitating membrane , protects their eyes underwater.
The eardrums are located behind the eyes and are covered by a movable flap of skin.
This flap closes, along with the nostrils and eyes, when they dive.
This prevents water from entering their external head openings.
Their jaws are covered with sensory pits , which hold bundles of nerve fibers that respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water.
Crocodiles can detect vibrations and small pressure changes in water.
This makes it possible for them to sense prey and danger even in total darkness, and becomes very useful when the animal is submerged in the water.
Like mammals and birds, and unlike other reptiles, crocodiles have a four-chambered heart.
But, unlike mammals, blood with and without oxygen can be mixed.

Crocodilians swallow stones, known as gastroliths, which help digest their prey.
The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation.
The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs, including keen eyesight, eardrums, and sensory pits that detect disturbances in the water.
