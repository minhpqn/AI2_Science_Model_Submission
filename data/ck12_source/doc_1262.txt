The material continues to cool.
It sinks back down into the mantle at a deep sea trench.
The material sinks back down to the core.
It moves horizontally again, completing a convection cell .
Convection cells move plates
Plates move for two reasons.
Upwelling mantle at the mid-ocean ridge pushes plates outward.
Cold lithosphere sinking into the mantle at a subduction zone pulls the rest of the plate down with it.
Seafloor spreading takes place as plates move apart from each other at a mid-ocean ridge.
Mantle convection drives seafloor spreading.
Plates move by seafloor spreading
Seafloor spreading is driven by mantle convection.
Plates move as if on a conveyor belt.
