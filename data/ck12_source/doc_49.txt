So a virus is very different from any of the organisms that fall into the three domains of life.
Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important traits with living organisms.
They have genetic material like all cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve.
The genetic material of a virus can change (mutate), altering the traits of the virus.
As the process of evolution has resulted in all life on the planet today, the classification of viruses has been controversial.
It calls into question the very definition of life.
Drawing of viruses attacking a cell
These little "alien" looking creatures are viruses, and these specific viruses infect Escherichia coli bacteria.
Shown is a representation of viruses infecting a cell.
The virus lands on the outside of the cell and injects its genetic material into the cell.
Viruses infect a variety of organisms, including plants, animals, and bacteria, injecting its genetic material into a cell of the host organism.
Once inside the host cell, they use the cellâ€™s own ATP (energy), ribosomes , enzymes , and other cellular parts to make copies of themselves.
The host cell makes a copy of the viral DNA and produces viral proteins.
These are then packaged into new viruses.
So viruses cannot replicate or reproduce on their own; they rely on a host cell to make additional viruses.
Viruses and Human Disease
Viruses cause many human diseases.
In addition to the flu and the common cold, viruses cause rabies, diarrheal diseases, AIDS , cold sores, and many other diseases ( Figure below ).
Viral diseases range from mild to fatal.
Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus
