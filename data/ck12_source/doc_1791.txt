Sediments are deposited in an environment of deposition.
This can be a sand dune, beach, lake, river bend, or a great number of other locations.
Scientists can figure out the environment of deposition of a sedimentary rock by looking at the size of sediments and the sedimentary features in the rock.
Many types of landforms are created by the deposition of sediments.
Some are described later in this chapter.
Plate tectonics forces work to build huge mountains and other landscapes.
Conversely, the forces of weathering gradually wear down those rocks and landscapes.
Together with erosion, tall mountains turn into hills and even plains.
The Appalachian Mountains along the east coast of North America were once as tall as the Himalayas.
Weathering breaks down Earth's materials into smaller pieces.
Erosion transports those pieces to other locations.
Weathering and erosion modify Earth's surface landscapes over time.
