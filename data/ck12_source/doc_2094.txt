Consequences of Using Alternative Fossil Fuels
Surface mining causes environmental damage.
A lot of water may be needed.
The water may be degraded.
For oil to be removed from shale, the water must be heated.
This requires energy.
Tar sands and oil shale fuels create more pollutants than other fossil fuels.
Extracting usable energy from oil shale and tar sands produces more greenhouse gases.
Keystone XL Pipeline
The Keystone XL Pipeline would transport oil from the oil sands in Alberta, Canada.
The oil would travel into the United States.
In the U.S. it would be refined.
The pipeline is controversial.
A leak could cause damage to wildlife habitat.
A leak could also release enough oil to contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer.
The Aquifer is crucial to agriculture and urban development in the Midwestern U.S.
When burned, the fuel from the oil sands would increase pollutants.
Greenhouse gases into the atmosphere would increase.
