In fact, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s 2 , so by 1 second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s.
By 2 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s), and so on.
The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is illustrated in the Figure below .

You can compare the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, the moon, and Mars with the interactive animation called “Freefall” at this URL:
Object falling off a cliff
Q :
In this diagram, the boy drops the object at time t = 0 s.
By t = 1 s, the object is falling at a velocity of 9.8 m/s.
What is its velocity by t = 5 s?
What will its velocity be at t = 6 s if it keeps falling?
A :
Its velocity at t = 5 s is 49.0 m/s, and at t = 6 s, it will be 58.8 m/s (49.0 m/s + 9.8 m/s).
Mass and Acceleration Due to Gravity
What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground?
The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater.
Would it fall to the ground faster?
No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time.
The reason?
