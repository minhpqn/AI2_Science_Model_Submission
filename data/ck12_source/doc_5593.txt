Weight is a measure of force that is equal to the gravitational pull on an object.
The weight of an object is dependent on its location.
On the moon, the force due to gravity is about one sixth that of the gravitational force on Earth.
Therefore, a given object will weigh six times more on Earth than it does on the moon.
Since mass is dependent only on the amount of matter present in an object, mass does not change with location.
Weight measurements are often made with a spring scale by reading the distance that a certain object pulls down and stretches a spring.
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter that an object contains.
Weight is a measure of force that is equal to the gravitational pull on an object.
Mass is independent of location, while weight depends on location.
