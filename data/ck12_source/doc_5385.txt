This may lead to the development of many cells that do not function optimally, resulting a less than optimal phenotype.
Various types of mutations can all have severe effects on the individual.
These include point mutations, framehift mutations and chromosomal alterations.
Keep in mind, some mutations may be beneficial or have no effect.
Mutations that have no effect will not affect the expression of the gene or the sequence of amino acids in an encoded protein.
Chromosomal alterations are large changes in the chromosome structure.
They occur when genetic material is added or removed from a chromosome.
This alteration of a chromosome may occur when a section of a chromosome breaks and rejoins a chromosome incorrectly, or does not rejoin at all.
Sometimes the segment may join backwards or reattach to another chromosome altogether.
These mutations are very serious and usually lethal to the zygote or embryo.
If the embryo does survive, the resulting organism is usually sterile and thus, unable to pass along the mutation.
The five types of chromosomal alterations are deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and translocations ( Figure below ).
Deletions are the removal of a large chromosomal region, leading to loss of the genes within that region.
Duplications (or amplifications ) lead to multiple copies of a chromosomal region, increasing the number of the genes located within that region.
Some genes may be duplicated in their entirety.
Insertions are the addition of material from one chromosome to a nonhomologous chromosome.
Inversions are reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.
Translocations are the interchange of genetic material between nonhomologous chromosomes.
