The element nitrogen is a gas that composes the majority of Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
A nitrogen atom has five valence electrons, which can be shown as one pair and three single electrons.
When combining with another nitrogen atom to form a diatomic molecule, the three single electrons on each atom combine to form three shared pairs of electrons.
A triple bond in nitrogen gas
Triple bond in N 2 .
Each nitrogen atom follows the octet rule with one lone pair of electrons and six electrons that are shared between the atoms.
Lewis structures can be drawn for molecules that share multiple pairs of electrons.

Why is the first ethene Lewis structure incorrect?
What do the single electrons in nitrogen do to for a triple bond?
Draw the Lewis structure for ethyne C 2 H 2 .
double covalent bond:
A covalent bond formed by atoms that share two pairs of electrons.
triple covalent bond:
A covalent bond formed by atoms that share three pairs of electrons.
Coordinate Covalent Bond
Define coordinate covalent bond.
Sharing toys is like sharing electrons
Is sharing a good thing?
Remember when you were younger and were told to share your favorite toy with your brother or sister or friend?
