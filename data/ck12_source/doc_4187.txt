Summarize the different leaf arrangements.
Explain why there are seasonal changes in leaves.
Could life exist without the leaf?
A leaf looks so simple.
But it is actually a very complex structure.
And it may be one of the most important organs in all kingdoms.
Life as we know it could not exist without leaves.
Why?
One word: photosynthesis.
Plants have specialized organs that help them survive and reproduce in a great diversity of habitats.
Major organs of most plants include roots, stems, and leaves.
Leaves are the keys not only to plant life but to all terrestrial life.
The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis .
Despite the fundamental importance of the work they do, there is great diversity in the leaves of plants.
However, given the diversity of habitats in which plants live, it’s not surprising that there is no single best way to collect solar energy for photosynthesis.
Leaves may vary in size, shape, and their arrangement on stems.
Nonflowering vascular plants have three basic types of leaves: microphylls (“tiny leaves”), fronds , and needles .
Figure below describes each type.
Leaf variation in nonflowering plants
Leaf variation in nonflowering plants reflects their evolutionary origins.
