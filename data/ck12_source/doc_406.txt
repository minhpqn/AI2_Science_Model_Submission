How does it pump blood?
The heart is divided into four chambers ( Figure below ), or spaces: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles.
An atrium (singular for atria) is one of the two small, thin-walled chambers on the top of the heart where the blood first enters.
A ventricle is one of the two muscular V-shaped chambers that pump blood out of the heart.
You can remember they are called ventricles because they are shaped like a "V."
