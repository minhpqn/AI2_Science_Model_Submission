Although it's extremely useful for ocean ecosystems, it's not very useful for people.
So where is the water that we can use?
Where Is Earth’s Freshwater?
Most of Earth’s water is salt water in the oceans.
As seen below, only 3 percent of Earth’s water is fresh ( Figure below ).
Freshwater is water that contains little or no dissolved salt.
Most freshwater is frozen in ice caps and glaciers.
Glaciers cover the peaks of some tall mountains.
For example, the Cascades Mountains in North America and the Alps Mountains in Europe are capped with ice.
Ice caps cover vast areas of Antarctica and Greenland.
Chunks of ice frequently break off ice caps.
They form icebergs that float in the oceans.

What percentage of Earth’s surface freshwater is water vapor in the air?
Only a tiny fraction of Earth’s freshwater is in the liquid state.
Most liquid freshwater is under the ground in layers of rock.
Of freshwater on the surface, the majority occurs in lakes and soil.
What percentage of freshwater on the surface is found in living things?
Water can remain in a particular location for a long time.
This is known as a reservoir .
