The greater the wind speed, the higher the windchill.
Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account.
It depends on air temperature and wind speed ( Figure below ).
Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isn't blowing.
Windchill temperature chart
Windchill temperatures may be very low in blizzards because of the high wind speeds.
How long does it take for frostbite to occur when the air temperature is 0Â° F and the wind speed is 55 miles per hour?
Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter.
If they are near a lake, they may be getting lake-effect snow .
The image below shows how lake-effect snow occurs ( Figure below ).
Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake.
When the winds reach the cold land on the other side, the air cools.
Since there was so much moisture in the air, it can drop a lot of snow.
More than 254 centimeters (100 inches) of snow may fall in a single lake-effect storm!
Diagram of lake-effect snow
Lake-effect snow falls on the east side of lakes in North America.
These snows are heaviest on the east sides of the Great Lakes.
Blizzards are often part of a mid-latitude cyclone.
The jet stream brings cold air into contact with warm moist air.
The difference in pressure between the air masses brings about strong winds.
