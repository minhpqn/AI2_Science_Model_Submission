Number of Deformed Frogs
Your results show that pesticide levels in the two sets of ponds are different, but the average number of deformed frogs is almost the same.
Your results demonstrate that your hypothesis is false.
The situation may be more complicated than you thought.
This gives you new information that will help you decide what to do next.
Even if the results supported your hypothesis, you would probably ask a new question to try to better understand what is happening to the frogs and why.
Drawing Conclusions and Communicating Results
If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the results will indicate whether your hypothesis is true or false.
If a hypothesis is true, scientists will often continue testing the hypothesis in new ways to learn more.
If a hypothesis is false, the results may be used to come up with and test a new hypothesis.
A scientist will then communicate the results to the scientific community.
This will allow others to review the information and extend the studies.
The scientific community can also use the information for related studies.
Scientists communicate their results in a number of ways.
For example, they may talk to small groups of scientists and give talks at large scientific meetings.
They will also write articles for scientific journals.
Their findings may also be communicated to journalists.
If you conclude that frogs are deformed due to a pesticide not previously measured, you would publish an article and give talks about your research.
Your conclusion could eventually help find solutions to this problem.
