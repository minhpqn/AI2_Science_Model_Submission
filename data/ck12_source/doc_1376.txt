This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash ( Figure below ).
The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick.
The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent.
The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions.
Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air.
Much of this material falls back down near the vent.
This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes.
The composition of magma that erupts at composite volcanoes is usually felsic (rhyolite) or intermediate (andesite).

Frequently there is a large crater at the top from the last eruption.
Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries.
When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts.
This creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions.
The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes.

Shield volcanoes look like a huge ancient warriorâ€™s shield laid down.

Both volcanoes are part of the Big Island of Hawaii.
