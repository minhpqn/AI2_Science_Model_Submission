People relaxing in a hot pool
Easing Aches and Pains
Sitting in a hot bath or spa has always been a great prescription for dealing with sore muscles.
People used to believe that it was even more beneficial to immerse themselves in radioactive hot springs and drink water containing radioactive materials (some still do).
In the early 1900s, people spent millions of dollars on treatments and “radioactive water” with the belief that all of their ills would be taken care of.
Radioactivity in the water was usually due to radon gas that leaked up from deep underground, formed by decay of other radioisotopes.
If you're feeling sore, find a hot pool and sit back and relax.
