Food irradiation is a sensitive subject for many people.
The practice involves exposing the food to ionizing radiation in order to kill harmful bacteria (such as salmonella) that cause sickness.
The food is essentially unchanged and does not lose any nutritive value.
Parasites and insect pests are easily destroyed by this process, while bacteria take longer to kill.
Viruses are not affected by the radiation treatment.
But don’t worry – the food is not radioactive and you will not glow in the dark if you eat it.
Nuclear Decay Processes
Radioactive decay involves the emission of a particle and/or energy as one atom changes into another.
In most instances, the atom changes its identity to become a new element.
There are four different types of emissions that occur.
Alpha (α) decay involves the release of helium ions from the nucleus of an atom.
This ion consists of two protons and two neutrons and has a 2+ charge.
Release of an α-particle produces a new atom that has an atomic number two less than the original atom and an atomic weight that is four less.
A typical alpha decay reaction is the conversion of uranium-238 to thorium:
{^{238}_{\phantom{0}92}\text{U}} \rightarrow {^{234}_{\phantom{0}90}\text{Th}} + {^4_2 \alpha^+}
We see a decrease of two in the atomic number (uranium to thorium) and a decrease of four in the atomic weight (238 to 234).
Usually the emission is not written with atomic number and weight indicated since it is a common particle whose properties should be memorized.
Quite often the alpha emission is accompanied by gamma (γ) radiation, a form of energy release.
Many of the largest elements in the periodic table are alpha-emitters.
