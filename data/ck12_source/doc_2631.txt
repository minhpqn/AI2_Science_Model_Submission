Yummy!
S’mores are on the way!
Did you ever toast marshmallows over a campfire?
The sweet treats singe on the outside and melt on the inside.
Both the fire and the toasted marshmallows are evidence of chemical changes.
In the process of burning, the wood changes to ashes and gases, and the outside of the marshmallow turns brown and crispy.
Neither the wood nor the marshmallows can change back to their original form.
That’s because burning is a chemical change and chemical changes are often impossible to undo.
In this unit, you’ll learn about many types of chemical changes, including how they occur and why you can’t live without them.
Define chemical bond.
Explain why chemical bonds form.
Compare and contrast types of chemical bonds.
Did you ever make cupcakes from scratch?
You mix together flour, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients to make the batter, put the batter into cupcake papers, and then put them into the oven to bake.
The cupcakes that come out of the oven after baking are different from any of the individual ingredients that went into the batter.
Like the ingredients that join together to make cupcakes, atoms of different elements can join together to form entirely different substances called compounds.
In cupcakes, the eggs and other wet ingredients cause the dry ingredients to stick together.
What causes elements to stick together in compounds?
The answer is chemical bonds.
