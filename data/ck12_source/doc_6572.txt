What is the product of a hydration reaction?
addition reaction:
A reaction in which an atom or molecule is added to an unsaturated molecule, making a single product.
hydration reaction:
A reaction in which water is added to an alkene.
hydrogenation:
A reaction that occurs when molecular hydrogen is added to an alkene to produce an alkane.

Benzoic acid is used to preserve food
Keeping Food Safe
Benzoic acid crystals in polarized light are pictured above.
Benzoic acid is widely used as a food preservative, either as the carboxylic acid or as the sodium benzoate salt.
This compound is most effective when added to acidic foods such as fruit juices and soft drinks.
The major industrial source of benzoic acid is the partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen.
The process is inexpensive and environmentally benign.
