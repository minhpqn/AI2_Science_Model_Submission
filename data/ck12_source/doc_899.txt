Then the top soil erodes and desertification can follow.
Desertification turns forest into a desert, where it is difficult for plants to grow.
Half of the Earthâ€™s mature tropical forests are gone.
At current rates of deforestation, all tropical forests will be gone by the year 2090.
One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment.
These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species .
These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow.
Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources.
Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure below ).
Recently, cargo ships have transported zebra mussels, spiny waterfleas, and ruffe (a freshwater fish) into the Great Lakes ( Figure below ).
These invasive species are better at hunting for food.
They have caused some of the native species to go extinct.
Invasive species can disrupt food chains, carry disease, prey on native species directly, and out-compete native species for limited resources, like food.
All of these effects can lead to extinction of the native species.
Exotic species such as the brown tree snake can cause the mass extinction of many species
An exotic species, the brown tree snake, hitchhiked on an aircraft to the Pacific Islands, causing the extinctions of many bird and mammal species which had evolved in the absence of predators.
Zebra mussels are invasive species that have cause significant economic damage to waterways.
These zebra mussels, an invasive species, live on most man-made and natural surfaces.
Here they have infested the walls of the Arthur V.
Ormond Lock on the Arkansas River.
