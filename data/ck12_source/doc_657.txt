Waves and Energy Transfer
Describe transverse waves.
Explain how waves transfer energy without transferring matter.
Define wavelength, frequency, and period of a transverse wave.
State the relationship between speed, wavelength, and frequency.
Solve problems using the relationships between speed, wavelength, frequency, and period.
Surfer riding a wave, a type of mechanical wave
This surfer rides a giant wave at the legendary big wave surf break known as as "Jaws" in Maui, HI.
Massive waves, such as this one, transfer huge amounts of energy.
Types of Waves
Water waves, sound waves, and the waves that travel along a rope are mechanical waves .
Mechanical waves require a material medium such as water, air, or rope.
Light waves, however, are electromagnetic waves and travel without a material medium.
They are not mechanical waves.
In all types of mechanical waves, energy moves from one place to another while the media carrying the wave only vibrates back and forth in position.
One type of mechanical wave is the transverse wave .
In the case of transverse waves, the movement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of the energy movement.
Transverse wave of a rope tied to a tree
In the sketch above, consider the transverse wave produced when the boy jerks one end of a rope up and down while the other end is tied to a tree.  The energy spent by the boy transfers permanently down the rope to the tree.
The rope, however, only moves up and down.
