Explain how wave speed is related to the medium of a wave.
Assume that you move one end of a rope up and down just once to generate a wave in the rope.
How long will take the wave to travel down the rope to the other end?
It depends on the speed of the wave.
The Speed of a Wave
Wave speed is the distance a wave travels in a given amount of time, such as the number of meters it travels per second.
Wave speed (and speed in general) can be represented by the equation:
Speed = \mathrm{\frac{Distance}{Time}}
Wave Speed, Wavelength, and Wave Frequency
Wave speed is related to both wavelength and wave frequency.
Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves.
Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time.
This equation shows how the three factors are related:
Speed = Wavelength x Wave Frequency
In this equation, wavelength is measured in meters and frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), or number of waves per second.
Therefore, wave speed is given in meters per second, which is the SI unit for speed.
Q:
If you increase the wavelength of a wave, does the speed of the wave increase as well?
A:
Increasing the wavelength of a wave doesnâ€™t change its speed.
