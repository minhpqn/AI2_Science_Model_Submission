Evaporation changes liquid water to water vapor.
Energy from the Sun causes water to evaporate.
Most evaporation is from the oceans because they cover so much area.
The water vapor rises into the atmosphere.
Transpiration is like evaporation because it changes liquid water to water vapor.
In transpiration, plants release water vapor through their leaves ( Figure below ).
This water vapor rises into the atmosphere.
Plant drawing up water and releasing water vapor through transpiration
Liquid water is taken up by plant roots.
The plant releases water vapor into the atmosphere.
This is transpiration.
Condensation changes water vapor to liquid water.
As air rises higher into the atmosphere, it cools.
Cool air can hold less water vapor than warm air.
So some of the water vapor condenses into water droplets.
Water droplets may form clouds.
Below is an example of condensation ( Figure below ).
Condensation on a cold bottle
A bottle that comes out of the refrigerator is cold.
It cools the air near the bottle.
