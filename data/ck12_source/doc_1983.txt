More children lived long enough to reach adulthood and have children of their own.
As the death rate fell, the birth rate stayed high for awhile.
This caused rapid population growth.
The Green Revolution
The most recent increase in the slope of the population line is because of another advance in agriculture.
The Green Revolution began in the mid-1900s.
The Green Revolution has allowed billions of people to be added to the population in the past few decades.
New methods and products increased how much food could be grown.
These advances include:
Improving crops by selecting for certain genetic traits.
The desired traits promote productivity.
Recently, genetically engineered crops have been introduced.
Increasing the use of artificial fertilizers and chemical pesticides .
Increasing the use of agricultural machinery: plowing, tilling, fertilizing, picking, and transporting.
These machines are powered by fossil fuels, rather than humans.
Increasing access to water.
Many rivers have been dammed.
Wells tap into many groundwater aquifers.
The Green Revolution has increased the productivity of farms immensely.
A century ago, a single farmer produced enough food for 2.5 people, but now a farmer can feed more than 130 people.
