Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean.
Some groundwater may be taken up by plant roots.
Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer .
This is an underground layer of rock that stores water, sometimes for thousands of years.

KQED:
Tracking Raindrops
We all rely on the water cycle, but how does it actually work?
Scientists at University of California Berkeley are embarking on a new project to understand how global warming is affecting our fresh water supply.
And they're doing it by tracking individual raindrops in Mendocino and north of Lake Tahoe.

Chemical elements and water are recycled through biogeochemical cycles.
The cycles include both biotic and abiotic parts of ecosystems.
The water cycle takes place on, above, and below Earthâ€™s surface.
In the cycle, water occurs as water vapor, liquid water, and ice.
Many processes are involved as water changes state in the cycle.
The atmosphere is an exchange pool for water.
Ice masses, aquifers, and the deep ocean are water reservoirs.
