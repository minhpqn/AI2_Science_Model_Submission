Others form large, flat sheets.
Some join in three dimensions.
Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicates.
In beryl, the silicate pyramids join together as rings.
Biotite is mica.
The silicate pyramids come together to create thin, flexible sheets.
Compare the beryl and the biotite pictured below ( Figure below ).
Beryl and biotite are both silicate minerals
Beryl (a) and biotite (b) are both silicate minerals.
Native elements contain only atoms of one type of element.
They are not combined with other elements.
There are very few examples of these types of minerals.
Some native elements are rare and valuable.
Gold, silver, sulfur, and diamond are examples.
What do you guess carbonate minerals contain?
If you guessed carbon, you would be right!
All carbonates contain one carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms.
Carbonates may include other elements.
A few of these are calcium, iron, and copper.
Carbonate minerals are often found where seas once covered the land.
