The Phanerozoic is recent history compared with the Precambrian.
This is one reason that the Paleozoic is much better known than the Precambrian.
Another reason is that Paleozoic organisms had hard parts, and they fossilized better.
Formation of Pangaea
A mountain-building event is called an orogeny .
Orogenies take place over tens or hundreds of millions of years.
Continents smash into each other.
Microcontinents and island arcs smash into continents.
All of these events cause mountains to rise.
When Pangaea came together there were orogenies all along the collision zones.
Geologists find much evidence of these orogenies.
For example, Laurentia collided with the Taconic Island Arc during the Taconic Orogeny ( Figure below ).
The remnants of this mountain range make up the Taconic Mountains in New York.
The Taconic Orogeny is an example of a collision between a continent and a volcanic island arc
The Taconic Orogeny is an example of a collision between a continent and a volcanic island arc.
Laurentia experienced other orogenies as it collided with the northern continents.
The southern continents came together to form Gondwana.
When Laurentia and Gondwana collided to create Pangaea, the Appalachians rose.
Geologists think the Appalachians were once higher than the Himalayas are now.
Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth.
