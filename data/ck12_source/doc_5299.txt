Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone.
Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells.
Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings.
Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered.
The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.
extra copy (complete or partial) of chromosome 21 (see Figure above )
developmental delays, distinctive facial appearance, and other abnormalities (see Figure above )
one X chromosome but no other sex chromosome (XO)
female with short height and infertility (inability to reproduce)
Triple X syndrome
three X chromosomes (XXX)
female with mild developmental delays and menstrual irregularities
one Y chromosome and two or more X chromosomes (XXY, XXXY)
male with problems in sexual development and reduced levels of the male hormone testosterone
Down syndrome :
Trisomy 21; individuals often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance.
karyotype :
Depicts, usually in a photograph, the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any large chromosomal abnormalities; usually taken during metaphase of mitosis.
Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome :
Syndrome due to the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells.
