Earth’s crust contains a lot of oxygen.
The oxygen can combine with other elements to create oxide minerals.
Oxides contain one or two metal elements combined with oxygen.
Oxides are different from silicates, because they do not contain silicon.
Many important metals are found as oxides.
For example, hematite and magnetite are both oxides that contain iron.
Hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ) has a ratio of two iron atoms to three oxygen atoms.
Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) has a ratio of three iron atoms to four oxygen atoms.
Notice that the word “magnetite” contains the word “magnet." Magnetite ( Figure below ) is a magnetic mineral.

Magnetite is one of the most distinctive oxides since it is magnetic.
Phosphate minerals have a structure similar to silicates.
In silicates, an atom of silicon is bonded to oxygen.
In phosphates , an atom of phosphorus, arsenic, or vanadium is bonded to oxygen.
There are many types of phosphate minerals, but phosphate minerals are rare.
The composition of phosphates is complex.
For example, turquoise contains copper, aluminum, and phosphorus ( Figure below ).

Turquoise is a phosphate mineral with a beautiful blue color.
The stone is not as rare as some minerals and is commonly used for jewelry.
