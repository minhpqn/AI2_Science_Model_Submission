Nomenclature of aromatic compounds
Substituents can be groups other than alky groups.
If a chlorine atom were substituted for a hydrogen, the name becomes chlorobenzene.
An –NH 2 group is called an amino group, so the corresponding molecule is called aminobenzene, often referred to as aniline.
An –NO 2 group is called a nitro group and so the third example below is nitrobenzene.
Examples of substituted aromatic compounds
If more than one substituent is present, their location relative to each other can be indicated by numbering the positions on the benzene ring.
Numbered positions on a benzene ring
The number of the carbon location then precedes the name of the substituent in the overall name, with the numbers separated by a comma.
As with branched alkanes, the system requires that the numbers be the lowest possible and that prefixes be used for more than one of the same substituent.
If there are different substituents, the first in alphabetical order is given the lower number and listed first.
The structures below are called 1,2-dimethylbenzene and 1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene.
Nomenclature of disubstituted aromatic compounds
An alternate system for naming di-substituted benzene rings uses three different prefixes: ortho , meta , and para .
If two groups are in the ortho position, they are on adjacent carbon atoms.
The meta positioning refers to being in a 1, 3 arrangement.
The para positioning refers to being in a 1, 4 arrangement.
Shown below are the three possibilities for dimethylbenzene, also called xylene.
Examples of nomenclature with ortho, para, and meta substitution
Lastly, a benzene ring missing one hydrogen atom (−C 6 H 5 ) can itself be considered the substituent on a longer chain of carbon atoms.
