What is speed?
If you walk 3 kilometers in 30 minutes, what is your average speed in kilometers per hour?
Compare and contrast instantaneous and average speed.
What distance will a truck travel in 3 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour?
Describe how to draw a position-time graph.
Explain how a position-time graph shows the velocity of a moving object.
Show how to calculate the average velocity of a moving object from a position-time graph of its motion.
Drawing line graphs can help you understand motion.
In this article, you’ll learn how to draw position-time graphs and how they show velocity.
Q:
What’s missing from the graph being drawn in the picture above?
A:
The x- and y-axes are missing.
Graphing Position and Time
The motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph like Graph 1 in the Figure below .
In this type of graph, the y-axis represents position relative to the starting point, and the x-axis represents time.
A position-time graph shows how far an object has traveled from its starting position at any given time since it started moving.

Q:
In the Figure above , what distance has the object traveled from the starting point by the time 5 seconds have elapsed?
