Eomaia .
Eomaia lived a little over 100 million years ago.
The placental mammal descendants of Eomaia were generally more successful than marsupials and monotremes.
On most continents, placental mammals became the dominant mammals, while marsupials and monotremes died out.
Marsupials remained the most common and diverse mammals in Australia.
The reason for their success there is not yet resolved.
Monotremes evolved about 150 million years ago.
Like modern monotremes, they had a cloaca and laid eggs.
Marsupials evolved about 130 million years ago.
They were very small and ate insects and worms.
Placental mammals evolved about 110 million years ago.
They were also small and climbed trees.
Placental mammals became the dominant land mammals.
Most marsupials and monotremes died out, except in Australia.
