Diagram of longshore currents
Longshore currents move water and sediment parallel to the shore.
They move in the direction of the prevailing local winds.
Rip currents are very dangerous currents!
Rip currents move large amounts of water offshore quickly.
Look at the rip-current animation to determine what to do if you are caught in a rip current: .
Each summer in the United States, at least a few people die when they are caught in rip currents.
This animation shows the surface currents in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean off of the southeastern United States:
Major surface ocean currents are the result of global wind patterns, Earth's rotation, and the shape of the ocean basins.
Major surface currents circle the oceans in five gyres.
Local surface currents, like longshore and rip currents, move near shorelines.
