The timeline of the evolution of life, shown in Figure below , outlines the major events in the development of life.
According to recent estimates, the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.
Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained in the rocks that form the Earth's crust.
The rock layers themselves, like pages in thick history book, record the surface shaping events of the past.
Buried within them are traces of life, including the plants and animals that evolved from organic structures that existed perhaps as many as 3 to 3.5 billion years ago.
How do scientists know Earth is so old?
The answer is in the rocks.
Contained in rocks that were once molten, shown in Figure below , are chemical elements that act like an atomic clock.
The atoms of different forms of elements (called isotopes ) break down at different rates over time.
Parent isotopes within these rocks decay at a predictable rate to form daughter isotopes.
By determining the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated—forming the so-called atomic clock.
Thus, the results of studies of rock layers ( stratigraphy ), and of fossils ( paleontology ), along with the ages of certain rocks as measured by atomic clocks ( geochronology ), indicate that the Earth is over 4.5 billion years old, with the oldest known rocks being 3.96 billion years old.
More about the history of life on Earth will be discussed in History of Life:
Introduction (Advanced) concept.
Molten rock, called lava , is expelled by a volcano during an eruption.
The lava will eventually cool to become solid rock.
When first expelled from a volcanic vent, it is a liquid at temperatures from 700 °C to 1,200 °C (1,300 °F to 2,200 °F).
Not all types of rocks come from cooled lava, but many do.
