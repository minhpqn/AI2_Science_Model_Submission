Does  K_{eq} change for a given reaction at a given temperature?
What does ICE stand for?
Will the equilibrium position change if materials are added to or removed from the reaction?
How does addition or removal of materials affect the K_{eq} ?
Initial Change Equilibrium (ICE):
A calculation that looks at the initial conditions, change, and new equilibrium in a reaction.
Solubility Product Constant (Ksp)
Define solubility product constant.
Perform calculations involving solubility product constants.
Gravimetric analysis used to be used to determine the amount of ion present in a solution
No more weighing
At one time, a major analytical technique was gravimetric analysis.
An ion would be precipitated out of solution, purified, and weighed to determine the amount of that ion in the original material.
As an example, measurement of Ca 2+ involved dissolving the sample in water, precipitating the calcium as calcium oxalate, purifying the precipitate, drying it, and weighing the final product.
Although this approach can be very accurate (atomic weights for many elements were determined this way), the process is slow, tedious, and prone to a number of errors in technique.
Newer methods are now available that measure minute amounts of calcium ions in solution without the long, involved gravimetric approach.
Solubility Product Constant
Ionic compounds have widely differing solubilities.
Sodium chloride has a solubility of about 360 g per liter of water at 25Â°C.
Salts of alkali metals tend to be quite soluble.
