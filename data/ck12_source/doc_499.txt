The tastes are:
Sweet, which is produced by the presence of sugars, such as the common table sugar sucrose, and a few other substances.
Salty, which is produced primarily by the presence of sodium ions.
Common salt is sodium chloride, NaCl.
The use of salt can donate the sodium ion producing this taste.
Sour, which is the taste that detects acidity.
The most common food group that contains naturally sour foods is fruit, such as lemon, grape, orange, and sometimes melon.
Children show a greater enjoyment of sour flavors than adults, and sour candy such as Lemon Drops, Shock Tarts and sour versions of Skittles and Starburst, is popular.
Many of these candies contain citric acid.
Bitter is an unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable taste.
Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, beer (due to hops), olives, and citrus peel.
Umami , which is a meaty or savory taste.
This taste can be found in fish, shellfish, cured meats, mushrooms, cheese, tomatoes, grains, and beans.
A single taste bud contains 50â€“100 taste cells representing all 5 taste sensations.
A stimulated taste receptor cell triggers action potentials in a nearby sensory neuron, which send messages to the brain about the taste.
The brain then decides what tastes you are sensing.
Your sense of smell also involves sensory neurons that sense chemicals.
The neurons are found in the nose, and they detect chemicals in the air.
Unlike taste neurons, which can detect only five different tastes, the sensory neurons in the nose can detect thousands of different odors.
Have you ever noticed that you lose your sense of taste when your nose is stuffed up?
