Step 3:
Think about your result
The number of moles of oxygen is far less than one mole, so the volume should be fairly small compared to molar volume (22.4 L/mol) since the pressure and temperature are reasonably close to standard.
The result has three significant figures because of the values for  T and P .
Since a joule (J) = kPa • L, the units cancel correctly, leaving a volume in liters.
The ideal gas constant is calculated.
An example of calculations using the ideal gas law is shown.
Work on the problems at the link below:
Which value of  R will you use if the pressure is given in atm?
You are doing a calculation where the pressure is given in mm Hg.
You select 8.314 J/K • mol as your value for R .
Will you get a correct answer?
How would you check that you have chosen the correct value of  R for your problem?
ideal gas constant:
The variable  R in the ideal gas law equation.
ideal gas law:
A single equation which relates the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of an ideal gas.
