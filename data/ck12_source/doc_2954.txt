Obviously, direction is an important component of motion.
Direction can be described in relative terms, such as up, down, in, out, left, right, forward, backward, or sideways.
Direction can also be described with the cardinal directions: north, south, east, or west.
On maps, cardinal directions are indicated with a compass rose.
You can see one in the bottom left corner of the map in the Figure below .
You can use the compass rose to find directions on the map.
For example, to go to the school from Jordan’s house, you would travel from east to west.
If you wanted to go on to the post office, you would change direction at the school and then travel from south to north.
Direction is an important component of a map
Why Direction Is Important
Look again at the map in the Figure above .
The distance from Jordan’s house to the post office is 3 km.
But if Jordan told a friend how to reach the post office from his house, he couldn’t just say “go 3 kilometers.” The friend might end up at the park instead of the post office.
Jordan would have to include direction as well as distance.
He could say, “go west for 2 kilometers and then go north for 1 kilometer.”
Motion and Vectors
When both distance and direction are considered, motion can be represented by a vector.
A vector is a measurement that has both size and direction.
It may be represented by an arrow.
If you are representing motion with an arrow, the length of the arrow represents distance, and the way the arrow points represents direction.
