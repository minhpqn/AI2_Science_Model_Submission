Process in cellular respiration or photosynthesis which produces ATP; uses the energy of hydrogen ions diffusing through ATP synthase.
chemiosmotic gradient :
H + difference across a membrane; established by the active transport of hydrogen ions by an electron transport chain.
electrochemical gradient :
Difference across a membrane due to both a chemical force and an electrical force; drives the movement of ions across the membrane.
electron transport chain :
Series of electron-transport molecules that pass high-energy electrons from molecule to molecule and capture their energy.
oxidative phosphorylation :
A metabolic process that uses energy released by the oxidation of nutrients to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
The third and final stage of aerobic cellular respiration, the electron transport chain, accounts for most of the ATP.
Stage 3 transfers the energy from NADH and FADH 2 to make ATP.
During electron transport, energy is used to pump hydrogen ions across the mitochondrial inner membrane, from the matrix into the intermembrane space.
A chemiosmotic gradient causes hydrogen ions to flow back across the mitochondrial membrane into the matrix, through ATP synthase, producing ATP.
When ATP from glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle are added, a total of 38 ATP result from aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose.
