Water power does not burn a fuel.
So it causes less pollution than many other kinds of energy.
Water power is also a renewable resource.
Water keeps flowing downhill.
Although we use some of the energy from this movement, we are not using up the water.
The Hoover Dam creates Lake Mead along the Colorado River
The Colorado River backs up behind Hoover Dam.
See the river coming in at the top of the photo.
Water power does have problems.
A large dam stops a stream's flow, which floods the land upstream ( Figure above ).
A beautiful location may be lost.
People may be displaced.
The dams and turbines also change the downstream environment.
Fish and other living things may not be able to survive.
Dams slow the release of silt.
Downstream deltas retreat and beaches may be starved of sand.
Seaside cities may become exposed to storms and rising sea levels.
Tidal power stations may need to close off a narrow bay or estuary.
Wave power plants must withstand coastal storms and the corrosion of seawater.
