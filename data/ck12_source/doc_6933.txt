P_{10\Omega}=\frac{V^2_{10\Omega}}{R_{10}\Omega}=\frac{(20V)^2}{10\Omega}=40W
^* Note:
If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total power outputted, as it should–Energy is always conserved.
Question:
How much current is flowing through each resistor?
Answer:
Use Ohm’s law to calculate the current for each resistor.
I_{90\Omega}=\frac{V_{90\Omega}}{R_{90\Omega}}=\frac{20V}{90\Omega}=0.22A \qquad I_{10\Omega}=\frac{V_{10\Omega}}{R_{10\Omega}}=\frac{20V}{10\Omega}=2.0A
Notice that the 10\Omega resistor has the most current going through it.
It has the least resistance to electricity so this makes sense.
^* Note:
If you add up the currents of the individual ‘rivers’ you get the total current of the of the circuit, as you should.
