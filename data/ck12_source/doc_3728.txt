To find the amino acid for a particular codon, find the cell in the table for the first and second bases of the codon.
Then, within that cell, find the codon with the correct third base.
For example CUG codes for leucine, AAG codes for lysine, and GGG codes for glycine.
Reading the Genetic Code
As shown in Figure above , the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine.
This codon is also the start codon that begins translation.
The start codon establishes the reading frame of mRNA.
The reading frame is the way the letters are divided into codons.
After the AUG start codon, the next three letters are read as the second codon.
The next three letters after that are read as the third codon, and so on.
This is illustrated in Figure below .
The mRNA molecule is read, codon by codon, until a stop codon is reached.
UAG, UGA, and UAA are all stop codons.
They do not code for any amino acids.
Stop codons are also known as termination codons.
How to read the genetic code using codons
Reading the Genetic Code.
The genetic code is read three bases at a time.
Codons are the code words of the genetic code.
Which amino acid does codon 2 in the drawing stand for?
