The  K_{sp} expressions in terms of  s can be used to solve problems in which the  K_{sp} is used to calculate the molar solubility as in the examples above.
Molar solubility can then be converted to solubility.
The process of determining solubilities using  K_{sp} values is described.
Read the material at the link below and do the problems at the end.
What information is needed to carry out these calculations?
What allows the calculation of molar solubility?
How is solubility determined?
Predict solubility of a compound based on the comparison between the ion product and the K_{sp} .
Barium sulfate is used to obtain clear images of the digestive tract
What do you see?
The invention of the X-ray machine had radically improved medical diagnosis and treatment.
For the first time, it was possible to see inside a person’s body to detect broken bones, tumors, obstructions, and other types of problems.
Barium sulfate is often used to examine patients with problems of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.
This insoluble compound coats the inside of the tissues and absorbs X-rays, allowing a clear picture of the interior structure of these organs.
Knowledge of  K_{sp} values will allow you to be able to predict whether or not a precipitate will form when two solutions are mixed together.
For example, suppose that a known solution of barium chloride is mixed with a known solution of sodium sulfate.
Barium sulfate is a mostly insoluble compound and so could potentially precipitate from the mixture.
However, it is first necessary to calculate the ion product , [Ba 2+ ][SO 4 2− ] for the solution.
