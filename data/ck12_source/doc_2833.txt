A:
Beta decay begins with a proton or neutron.
You can see how in the Figure below .

Q:
How does beta decay change an atom to a different element?
A:
In beta-minus decay an atom gains a proton, and it beta-plus decay it loses a proton.
In each case, the atom becomes a different element because it has a different number of protons.
Equations for Beta Decay
Radioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols..
For example, a beta-minus particle (electron) is represented by the symbol \mathrm{^0_{-1} e} .
The subscript -1 represents the particle’s charge, and the superscript 0 shows that the particle has virtually no mass (no protons or neutrons).
Another example is the radioactive nucleus of thorium-234.
It is represented by the symbol \mathrm{^{234}_{90} Th} , where the subscript 90 stands for the number of protons and the superscript 234 for the number of protons plus neutrons.
Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive decay.
Let’s consider the example of the beta-minus decay of thorium-234 to protactinium-234.
This reaction is represented by the equation:
\mathrm{^{234}_{90} Th} → \mathrm{^{234}_{91} Pa} + \mathrm{^0_{-1} e} + energy
The equation shows that thorium-234 becomes protactinium-234 and loses a beta particle and energy.
