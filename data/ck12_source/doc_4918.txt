secretory vesicle :
Vesicle with materials that are to be excreted/secreted from the cell.
SNARE :
Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor; mediate vesicle fusion through full fusion exocytosis or kiss-and-run fusion exocytosis.
synaptic vesicle :
Vesicle located at presynaptic terminals in neurons; store neurotransmitters.
transport vesicle :
A vesicle that is able to move molecules between locations inside the cell.
vacuole :
Membrane-bound organelle that can have secretory, excretory, and storage functions; plant cells have a large central vacuole.
vesicle :
A small, spherical compartment that is separated from the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer; used for transport and storage.
vesicle coat :
Clusters selected membrane cargo proteins into regions of the plasma membrane for internalization; develops vesicle buds.
Vesicles store and transport materials with the cell.
Some of these materials are transported to other organelles, other materials are secreted from the cell.
Examples of vesicles include secretory vesicles, transport vesicles, synaptic vesicles and lysosomes.
Vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles that can have secretory, excretory, and storage functions.They are usually larger than vesicles.
Compare vesicles to vacuoles.
Describe three types of vesicles.
