Gas particles are in random straight-line motion according to the kinetic-molecular theory.
The space between particles is very large compared to the particle size.
Assumptions of the kinetic-molecular theory:
Gases consist of very large numbers of tiny spherical particles that are far apart from one another compared to their size.
Gas particles are in constant rapid motion in random directions.
Collisions between gas particles and between particles and the container walls are elastic collisions.
There are no forces of attraction or repulsion between gas particles.
The average kinetic energy of gas particles is dependent upon the temperature of the gas.

gas:  Consists of very large numbers of tiny spherical particles that are far apart from one another compared to their size.
ideal gas:

Define gas pressure.
Hot air balloons float because the air inside expands as it exerts a pressure on the balloon
