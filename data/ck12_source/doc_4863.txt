For example, the neuron in Figure below has long, thin extensions ( axons and dendritres ) that reach out to other nerve cells.
The extensions help the neuron pass chemical and electrical messages quickly through the body.
The shape of the red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) enable these cells to easily move through capillaries .
The spikes on the pollen grain help it stick to a pollinating insect or animal so that it can be transferred to and pollinate another flower.
The long whip-like flagella (tails) of the algae Chlamydomonas help it swim in water.
Cells come in very different shapes.
Left to right, top row:
Long, thin nerve cells; biconcave red blood cells; curved-rod shaped bacteria.
Left to right, bottom row: oval, flagellated algae and round, spiky pollen grains are just a sample of the many shapes.
axon :
A long, slender projection of a neuron that conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body.
capillary :
The smallest of a body's blood vessels.
dendrite :
Branched projections of a neuron; conducts the electrochemical stimulation received from other cells to the cell body.
egg (Latin, ovum) :
Cell in which an embryo first begins to develop.
erythrocyte :
Flattened, doubly concave cells that carry oxygen; also known as red blood cells.
eukaryotic cell :
