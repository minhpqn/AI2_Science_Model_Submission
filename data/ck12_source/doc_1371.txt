Predicting Volcanic Eruptions
Explain how scientists attempt to predict volcanic eruptions.
What is one of the deadliest science jobs?
No one can predict exactly when a volcanic eruption will take place.
There are clues, but no one knows exactly when.
Sometimes a volcano will erupt when scientists are studying it.
Volcanologists have a high fatality rate among scientists because forecasting eruptions is so difficult.
