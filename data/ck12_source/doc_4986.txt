Therefore, energy is stored within cells in the chemical bonds of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins.
This energy is released during aerobic respiration.
The energy for most living organisms initially originates from the sun.
This energy is absorbed by producers, usually photosynthetic organisms such as plants.
Plants convert this energy into chemical energy, in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose.
Energy can be stored in this state, or converted into a usable form of energy, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) .
This occurs in both the plant, as well as the organisms that eat the plant, or eat the organism that ate the plant.
Forms of Energy
Energy can take several different forms.
Common forms of energy include light, chemical, and heat energy.
Other common forms are kinetic and potential energy.
How Organisms Change Energy
In organisms, energy is always changing from one form to another.
For example, plants obtain light energy from sunlight and change it to chemical energy in food molecules, such as glucose.
Chemical energy is energy stored in bonds between atoms within food molecules.
When other organisms eat and digest the food, they break the chemical bonds and release the chemical energy.
Organisms do not use energy very efficiently.
About 90 percent of the energy they obtain from food is converted to heat energy that is given off to the environment.
Kinetic and Potential Energy
Energy also constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy.
