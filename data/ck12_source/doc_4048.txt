They may move with pseudopods or flagella.
Although not plants themselves, algae were probably the ancestors of plants.
Ecology of Algae
Algae play significant roles as producers in aquatic ecosystems.
Microscopic forms live suspended in the water column.
They are the main component of phytoplankton .
As such, they contribute to the food base of most marine ecosystems.
Multicellular seaweeds called kelp may grow as large as trees.
They are the food base of ecosystems called kelp forests (see Figure below ).
Kelp forests are found throughout the ocean in temperate and arctic climates.
They are highly productive ecosystems.
Kelp forests help sustain large communities
Kelp Forest.
This kelp forest supports a large community of many other types of organisms.
Classification of Algae
Types of algae include red and green algae, and euglenids , and dinoflagellates (see Table below for examples).
Scientists think that red and green algae evolved from endosymbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria.
Their chloroplasts have two membranes because the cell membranes of the cyanobacteria became additional plasma membranes of the chloroplasts.
Scientists think that euglenids and dinoflagellates evolved later, from endosymbiotic relationships with green and red algae.
This is why their chloroplasts have three membranes.
