But in nature, organisms that cannot get food will die or find a new place to live.
It is possible for any resource to be a limiting factor, however, a resource such as food can have dramatic consequences on a population.
In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual.
When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high.
As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease.
When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die.
Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop.
This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.
When the population decreases to a certain level where every individual can get enough food and other resources, and the birth and death rates become stable, the population has leveled off at its carrying capacity.
Other Limiting Factors
Other limiting factors include light, water, nutrients or minerals, oxygen, the ability of an ecosystem to recycle nutrients and/or waste, disease and/or parasites, temperature, space, and predation.
Can you think of some other factors that limit populations?
Weather can also be a limiting factor.
Whereas most plants like rain, an individual cactus-like Agave americana plant actually likes to grow when it is dry.
Rainfall limits reproduction of this plant which, in turn, limits growth rate.
Can you think of some other factors like this?
Human activities can also limit the growth of populations.
Such activities include use of pesticides, such as DDT, use of herbicides, and habitat destruction.
Limiting factors, or things in the environment that can lower the population growth rate, include low food supply and lack of space.
When organisms face limiting factors, they show logistic type of growth (S-curve).
