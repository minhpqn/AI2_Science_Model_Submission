What is an isotope?
What is average atomic mass?
What is radioactive decay?
What is carbon dating?
What makes an isotope radioactive?
Are all isotopes radioactive?
What is a parent isotope and a daughter product?
Describe half-life.
Use an example.
Radiometric dating uses radioactive isotopes to get the absolute ages of rocks and other materials.
Can wood give an age in another way?
In the section on tree ring dating, there was a photo of a ruin at Mesa Verde National Park.
This photo is also from Mesa Verde.
In archeological sites, wood can be dated by tree rings.
It can also be dated by radiometric dating.
Carbon-14 dating is very useful for ruins that contain wood.
If the tree died around the time the ladder was created, then carbon-14 can tell the age of the ladder.
If the ladder was built for the site, then that age will be the age of the archeological site.
The rate of decay of unstable isotopes can be used to estimate the absolute ages of fossils and rocks.
This type of dating is called radiometric dating .
