Many ionic compounds are used in industry.
The human body needs several ions for good health.
Having low levels of the ions can endanger important functions such as heartbeat.
Solutions of ionic compounds can be used to restore the ions.
Uses of calcium, barium, and cobalt chloride
Ionic compounds consist of oppositely charged ions that are held together by ionic bonds.
The opposite charges cancel out so ionic compounds have a net neutral charge.
Ionic compounds form when metals transfer valence electrons to nonmetals.
Ionic compounds exist as crystals rather than molecules.
A crystal consists of many alternating positive and negative ions bonded together in a matrix.
Ionic compounds are named for their positive metal ion first, followed by their negative nonmetal ion.
Ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points.
They are good conductors of electricity but only when dissolved in water.
Their crystals are rigid and brittle.
Ionic compounds have many uses in industry.
They are also needed by humans and other living things.
