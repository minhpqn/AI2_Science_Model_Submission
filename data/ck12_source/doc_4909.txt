Briefly, the ribosomes interact with other RNA molecules to make chains of amino acids called polypeptide chains, due to the peptide bond that forms between individual amino acids.
Inside the ribosome, three sites participate in the translation process, the A, P and E sites.
Translation will be discussed in detail the Protein Synthesis:
Translation (Advanced) concept.
Ribosomes from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, have significantly different structures and RNA sequences.
The ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells significantly resemble those in bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria.
Ribosomes are produced in the nucleolus, and then transported to the cytoplasm.
Ribosomes are made of ribosomal proteins, called ribonucleoproteins , and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
Each ribosome has two parts, a large and a small subunit, as shown in Figure below .
The subunits are attached to each other.
During translation, the smaller subunit binds to the mRNA, while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA with attached amino acids.
When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, the two ribosomal subunits disassociate.
The two subunits that make up a ribosome, small organelles that are intercellular protein factories.
The two ribosomal subunits are named base on their sedmentation rate in a centrifuge.
The unit of measurement is the Svedberg unit , a measure of the rate of sedimentation, not the size.
This accounts for why fragment names do not add up (70S is made of 50S and 30S).
Prokaryotes have 70S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (30S) and a large (50S) subunit.
Their small subunit has a 16S RNA subunit (consisting of 1540 nucleotides) bound to 21 proteins.
The large subunit is composed of a 5S RNA subunit (120 nucleotides), a 23S RNA subunit (2900 nucleotides) and 31 proteins.
Eukaryotes have 80S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (40S) and large (60S) subunit.
