To consider larger relative amounts, each coefficient can be multiplied by the same number.
For example, 10 molecules of nitrogen would react with 30 molecules of hydrogen to produce 20 molecules of ammonia.
The most useful quantity for counting particles is the mole.
So if each coefficient is multiplied by a mole, the balanced chemical equation tells us that 1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to produce 2 moles of ammonia.
This is the conventional way to interpret any balanced chemical equation.
Finally, if each mole quantity is converted to grams by using the molar mass, we can see that the law of conservation of mass is followed. 1 mol of nitrogen has a mass of 28.02 g, while 3 mol of hydrogen has a mass of 6.06 g, and 2 mol of ammonia has a mass of 34.08 g.
28.02 \ \text{g N}_2 + 6.06 \ \text{g H}_2 \rightarrow 34.08 \ \text{g NH}_3
Mass and the number of atoms must be conserved in any chemical reaction.
The number of molecules is not necessarily conserved.

A mole ratio is a conversion factor that relates the amounts in moles of any two substances in a chemical reaction.
The numbers in a conversion factor come from the coefficients of the balanced chemical equation.
The following six mole ratios can be written for the ammonia forming reaction above.
&\frac{1 \text{ mol N}_2}{3 \text{ mol H}_2} \quad \quad or \quad \ \ \frac{3 \text{ mol H}_2}{1 \text{ mol N}_2} \\&\frac{1 \text{ mol N}_2}{2 \text{ mol NH}_3} \quad or \quad \ \ \frac{2 \text{ mol NH}_3}{1 \text{ mol N}_2} \\&\frac{3 \text{ mol H}_2}{2 \text{ mol NH}_3} \quad or \quad \ \ \frac{2 \text{ mol NH}_3}{3 \text{ mol H}_2}
In a mole ratio problem, the given substance, expressed in moles, is written first.
The appropriate conversion factor is chosen in order to convert from moles of the given substance to moles of the unknown.
