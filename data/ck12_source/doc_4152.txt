After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed.
A grain of pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule (see Figure below ).
It carries sperm to an ovule while preventing it from drying out.
Pollen grains canâ€™t swim, but they are very light, so the wind can carry them.
Therefore, they can travel through air instead of water.
Wind-blown pollen might land anywhere and be wasted.
Another adaptation solved this problem.
Plants evolved traits that attract specific animal pollinators .
Like the bee in Figure below , a pollinator picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another plant of the same species.
This greatly increases the chance that fertilization will occur.
Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube, called a pollen tube , through which sperm could be transferred directly from the pollen grain to the egg.
This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water.
It finally freed up plants from depending on moisture to reproduce.
Prickly surfaces help pollen stick to pollinators like bees
Individual grains of pollen may have prickly surfaces that help them stick to pollinators such as bees.
What other animals pollinate plants?
Seed Plants Diverge
The first seed plants formed seeds in cones.
Cones are made up of overlapping scales, which are modified leaves (see Figure below ).
Male cones contain pollen, and female cones contain eggs.
