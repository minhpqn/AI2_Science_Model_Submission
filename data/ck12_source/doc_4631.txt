How does each structure contribute to the spermâ€™s function?
Sperm are released from the body during ejaculation .
Ejaculation occurs when muscle contractions propel sperm from the epididymis.
The sperm are forced through the ducts and out of the body through the urethra.
As sperm travel through the ducts, they mix with fluids from the glands to form semen.
Hundreds of millions of sperm are released with each ejaculation.
Sperm are produced in the testes in the process of spermatogenesis.
Sperm mature in the epididymis before being ejaculated from the body through the penis.
