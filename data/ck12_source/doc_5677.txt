Why?
We need to take into account the percent natural abundances of each isotope in order to calculate what is called the weighted average.
The atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element.
The sample problem below demonstrates how to calculate the atomic mass of chlorine.
Sample Problem:
Calculating Atomic Mass
Use the atomic masses of each of the two isotopes of chlorine along with their percent abundances to calculate the average atomic mass of chlorine.
Step 1:
List the known and unknown quantities and plan the problem.
chlorine-35: atomic mass = 34.969 amu and % abundance = 75.77%
chlorine-37: atomic mass = 36.966 amu and % abundance = 24.23%
Average atomic mass of chlorine
Change each percent abundance into decimal form by dividing by 100.
Multiply this value by the atomic mass of that isotope.
Add together for each isotope to get the average atomic mass.
Step 2:
Calculate
& \text{chlorine-35} && 0.7577 \times 34.969=26.50 \ \text{amu}\\& \text{chlorine-37} && 0.2423 \times 36.966=8.957 \ \text{amu}\\& \text{average atomic mass} && 26.50 + 8.957=35.45 \ \text{amu}
Note:
Applying significant figure rules results in the 35.45 amu result without excessive rounding error.
