What's different about these landscapes?
Both of these rivers run through Yellowstone National Park.
The Firehole River is a tributary of the Madison.
In this photo, it's flowing over flat ground.
The Yellowstone River on the right is cascading over Yellowstone Falls.
Which river is doing more erosion?
In what direction is the stream eroding?
Erosion by Surface Water
Water that flows over Earthâ€™s surface includes runoff, streams, and rivers.
All these types of flowing water can cause erosion and deposition.
Erosion by Runoff
When a lot of rain falls in a short period of time, much of the water is unable to soak into the ground.
Instead, it runs over the land.
Gravity causes the water to flow from higher to lower ground.
As the runoff flows, it may pick up loose bits of soil and sand.
Runoff causes more erosion if the land is bare.
Plants help hold the soil in place.
The runoff water pictured below ( Figure below ) is brown because it eroded soil from a bare, sloping field.
Can you find evidence of erosion by runoff where you live?
What should you look for?
