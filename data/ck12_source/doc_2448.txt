Predict which liquid has greater viscosity: olive oil or motor oil (SAE 40).
Then do online research to find out if your prediction is correct.
Identify properties of gases.
Explain why gases exert pressure.
Describe how atmospheric pressure changes as altitude increases.
A hiker pauses to view the impressive peak of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world.
At the top of Mount Everest, the air is very thin.
Climbers may need oxygen tanks to get enough oxygen to breathe, even though oxygen is the second most plentiful gas in the atmosphere.
What Is a Gas?
A gas is one of four well-known states of matter. (The other three are solid, liquid, and plasma).
The particles of a gas can pull apart from each other and spread out.
As a result, a gas does not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume.
In fact, a gas always spreads out to take up whatever space is available to it.
If a gas is enclosed in a container, it spreads out until it has the same volume as the container.
Q:
The sketches in the Figure below represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles (represented by dots).
