A proton is one of three main particles that make up the atom.
The other two particles are the neutron and electron.
Protons are found in the nucleus of the atom.
This is a tiny, dense region at the center of the atom.
Protons have a positive electrical charge of one (+1) and a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 1.67 × 10 -27 kilograms.
Together with neutrons, they make up virtually all of the mass of an atom.

Q:
How do you think the sun is related to protons?
A:
The sun’s tremendous energy is the result of proton interactions.
In the sun, as well as in other stars, protons from hydrogen atoms combine, or fuse, to form nuclei of helium atoms.
This fusion reaction releases a huge amount of energy and takes place in nature only at the extremely high temperatures of stars such as the sun.
Identical Protons, Different Elements
All protons are identical.
For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other elements, or pure substances.
However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons.
In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements.
For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons.
