Where did chemistry come from?
Early “chemists” focused on practical questions – how to make dyes and perfumes, soap manufacture, uses of metals, and glass production among others.
The goal was not to understand the physical world – that came later.
People just wanted to make things that would improve their lives in some way.
History of Chemistry
The history of chemistry is an interesting and challenging one.  Very early chemists were often motivated mainly by the achievement of a specific goal or product.  Making perfume or soaps did not need a lot of theory , just a good recipe and careful attention to detail.  There was no standard way of naming materials (and no periodic table that we could all agree on).  It is often difficult to figure out exactly what a particular person was using.  However, the science developed over the centuries.
Major progress was made in putting chemistry on a solid foundation when Robert Boyle (1637-1691) began his research in chemistry.  He developed the basic ideas for the behavior of gases.
We could then describe gases mathematically.  Boyle also helped develop the idea that small particles could combine to form molecules.  Many years later, John Dalton used these ideas to develop the atomic theory.
Portrait of Robert Boyle
The field of chemistry began to develop rapidly in the 1700s.
Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) isolated and characterized several gases: oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide.
It was later discovered that nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) worked as an anesthetic.
This gas was used for that purpose for the first time in 1844 during a tooth extraction.
Other gases discovered during that time were chlorine, by C.W.
Scheele (1742-1786) and nitrogen, by Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794).
