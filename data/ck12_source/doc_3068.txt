What is the weight (force) of the rock?
What is the mechanical advantage of the lever in question 1?
What is the mechanical advantage of a machine?
How is the actual mechanical advantage of a machine calculated?
How does ideal mechanical advantage differ from actual mechanical advantage?
Why is the ideal mechanical advantage of a machine always greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine?
A hammer has an input distance of 3 cm and an output distance of 9 cm.
What is its ideal mechanical advantage?
Describe an inclined plane.
Explain how an inclined plane changes force to make work easier.
Identify the mechanical advantage of an inclined plane.
The highway above switches back and forth as it climbs up the steep hillside.
The much gentler slope of the road makes it easier for vehicles to reach the top of the mountain.
The highway is an example of an inclined plane.
What Is an Inclined Plane?
An inclined plane is a simple machine that consists of a sloping surface connecting a lower elevation to a higher elevation.
An inclined plane is one of six types of simple machines, and it is one of the oldest and most basic.
In fact, two other simple machines, the wedge and the screw, are variations of the inclined plane.
A ramp like the one in the Figure below is another example of an inclined plane.
Inclined planes make it easier to move objects to a higher elevation.
