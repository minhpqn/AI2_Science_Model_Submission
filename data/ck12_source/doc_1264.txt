Oceanic crust is created at mid-ocean ridges.
The crust moves outward from the ridge over time.
The crust may eventually sink into the mantle and be destroyed.
If a continent sits on a plate with a mid-ocean ridge, the continent will be pushed along.
Two plates meet at a plate boundary .
There are three types of plate boundaries since there are three ways that plates can meet.
Plates can move away from each other.
They can move toward each other.
Finally, they can slide past each other.
The three types of plate boundaries are divergent, convergent, and transform.
They are described in the following three concepts.
Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries.
This activity includes volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building.
The activity occurs as plates interact.
Giant slabs of lithosphere moving around can create a lot of activity!
The features seen at a plate boundary are determined by the direction of plate motion and by the type of crust found at the boundary.
What the Theory Explains
The theory of plate tectonics explains most of the features of Earthâ€™s surface.
It explains why earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain ranges are where they are.
It explains where to find some mineral resources.
