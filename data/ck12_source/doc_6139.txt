Give two examples of electrolytes.
Give two examples of nonelectrolytes.
electrolyte:
A compound that conducts an electric current when it is in an aqueous solution or melted.
nonelectrolyte:
A compound that does not conduct an electric current in either aqueous solution or in the molten state.
conductivity:
The ability to form an electric current.
Be able to write equations for dissociation of ionic compounds.
In order to function, deicing salts must first dissociate into their component ions
Have you ever seen trucks pour salt on icy roads?
In many areas, ice on the streets and sidewalks represent a serious walking and driving hazard.  One common approach to melting the ice is to put some form of deicing salt on the surface.  Materials such as sodium chloride or calcium chloride are frequently employed for this purpose.  In order to be effective, the solid material must first dissolve and break up into the ions that make up the compound.
An ionic crystal lattice breaks apart when it is dissolved in water.
Dissociation is the separation of ions that occurs when a solid ionic compound dissolves.  It is important to be able to write dissociation equations.  Simply undo the crisscross method that you learned when writing chemical formulas of ionic compounds.  The subscripts for the ions in the chemical formulas become the coefficients of the respective ions on the product side of the equation.  Shown below are dissociation equations for NaCl, Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , and (NH 4 ) 3 PO 4 .
NaCl( s ) → Na + ( aq ) + Cl - ( aq )
Ca(NO 3 ) 2 ( aq ) → Ca 2+ ( aq ) + 2NO 3 - ( aq )
