This is one reason that needles may be especially rich in chlorophyll, as you can see from the dark green pine needles in Figure below .
This is also an important adaptation for low levels of sunlight, allowing evergreens to live far from the equator.
Evergreen needles compared to deciduous leaves
Compare the color of the evergreen needles and the deciduous leaf.
Why is the darker color of the needles adaptive?
The primary function of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis.
In a deciduous plant, leaves seasonally turn color and fall off the plant.
They are replaced with new leaves later in the year.
An evergreen plant keeps its green leaves year-round.
It may have needle-like leaves to reduce water loss.
