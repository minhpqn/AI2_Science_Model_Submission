Hagfish are very simple vertebrates.
As early vertebrates evolved, they became more complex.
Around 365 million years ago, they finally made the transition from water to land.
The first vertebrates to live on land were amphibians.
They evolved from lobe-finned fish.
You can compare a lobe-finned fish and an amphibian in Figure below .
Evolution of lobe-finned fish to early amphibians
From Lobe-Finned Fish to Early Amphibian.
Lobe-finned fish evolved into the earliest amphibians.
A lobe-finned fish could breathe air for brief periods of time.
It could also use its fins to walk on land for short distances.
What similarities do you see between the lobe-finned fish and the amphibian?
Evolution of Amniotes
Amphibians were the first animals to have true lungs and limbs for life on land.
However, they still had to return to water to reproduce.
Thatâ€™s because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on land.
The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes.
Amniotes are animals that produce eggs with internal membranes.
The membranes let gases but not water pass through.
Therefore, in an amniotic egg, an embryo can breathe without drying out.
