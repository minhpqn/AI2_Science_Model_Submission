However, many living things can also make ATP without oxygen.
This is true of some plants and fungi and also of many bacteria.
These organisms use aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but when oxygen is in short supply, they use anaerobic respiration instead.
Certain bacteria can only use anaerobic respiration.
In fact, they may not be able to survive at all in the presence of oxygen.
An important way of making ATP without oxygen is called fermentation .
It involves glycolysis, but not the other two stages of aerobic respiration.
Many bacteria and yeasts carry out fermentation.
People use these organisms to make yogurt, bread, wine, and biofuels.
Human muscle cells also use fermentation.
This occurs when muscle cells cannot get oxygen fast enough to meet their energy needs through aerobic respiration.
There are two types of fermentation: lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation.
Both types of fermentation are described below.
You can also watch animations of both types at this link:
Lactic Acid Fermentation
In lactic acid fermentation , pyruvic acid from glycolysis changes to lactic acid.
This is shown in Figure below .
In the process, NAD + forms from NADH.
NAD + , in turn, lets glycolysis continue.
This results in additional molecules of ATP.
