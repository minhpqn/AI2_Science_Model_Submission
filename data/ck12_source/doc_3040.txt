The arrows representing the force applied by the break cylinder are larger than the arrow representing the force applied by the brake pedal mechanism.
A larger arrow indicates greater force.
Q :
How do hydraulic brakes increase the force that is applied to the brake shoes?
A :
The pressure exerted by the fluid on the brake shoes is applied over a larger area.
When pressure acts over a larger area, it increases the force (Force = Pressure × Area).
Hydraulic car lifts also use fluid to transmit pressure and increase force.
The lifts are used to raise cars, which are very heavy, so mechanics can work on them from underneath.
Controls in airplanes use fluids to transmit pressure and increase force so a flick of a switch can raise or lower heavy landing gear.

Pascal’s law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid.
The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very useful—from getting toothpaste out of a tube to applying the brakes on a car.
