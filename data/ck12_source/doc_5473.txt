National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) , part of the NIH, as well as comparable organizations in Europe and Japan, maintain the genomic sequences in a database known as GenBank .
Protein sequences are also maintained in this database.
The sequences in these databases are the combined sequences of anonymous donors, and as such do not yet address the individual differences that make us unique.
However, the known sequence does lay the foundation to identify the unique differences among all of us.
Most of the currently identified variations among individuals will be single nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNPs.
A SNP (pronounced "snip") is a DNA sequence variation occurring at a single nucleotide in the genome.
For example, two sequenced DNA fragments from different individuals, GGATCTACCGAA to GGATTTACCGAA, contain a difference in a single nucleotide.
If this base change occurs in a gene, the base change then results in two alleles: the C allele and the T allele.
Remember an allele is an alternative form of a gene.
Almost all common SNPs have only two alleles.
The effect of these SNPs on protein structure and function, and any effect on the resulting phenotype, is an extensive field of study.
