They also asked what was the radioactivity in the bacterial pellet: 32 P or 35 S.
Only the radioactively labeled DNA was found inside the bacteria, whereas the radioactive proteins stayed in the solution ( Figure below ).
These experiments demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material and that protein does not transmit genetic information.
The Hershey and Chase experiment.
T2 virus with either radioactive protein (upper section) or radioactive DNA (lower section) were used to infect bacteria.
A blender was used to remove the phage from the bacteria followed by centrifugation.
The radioactive DNA was found inside the bacteria (lower section), demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
See Bacteria and viruses have DNA too at for a description of the work of Joshua Lederberg.
bacteriophage :
A virus that infects and replicates within bacteria; also known as phage.
deoxyribonuclease :
A type of nuclease that catalyzes the degradation of DNA;
DNase.
lytic cycle :
Cycle of viral reproduction in which the virus kills the host, releasing newly formed virions.
protease :
An enzyme that conducts proteolysis or hydrolysis of the peptide bonds between amino acids in a polypeptide chain; includes trypsin and chymotrypsin.
ribonuclease :
A type of nuclease that catalyzes the degradation of RNA;
RNase.
