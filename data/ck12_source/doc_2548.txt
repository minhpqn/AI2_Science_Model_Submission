Q:
The idea that energy is transferred only in discrete units, or quanta, was revolutionary when Max Planck first proposed it in 1901.
However, what scientists already knew about matter may have made it easier for them to accept the idea of energy quanta.
Can you explain?
A:
Scientists already knew that matter exists in discrete units called atoms.
This idea had been demonstrated by John Dalton around 1800.
Knowing this may have made it easier for scientists to accept the idea that energy exists in discrete units as well.
In Bohr’s atomic model, electrons move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have.
The fixed distances where electrons may orbit are called energy levels.
Bohr arrived at his model by applying Planck’s idea of energy quanta to Rutherford’s atomic model of electrons orbiting the nucleus.
