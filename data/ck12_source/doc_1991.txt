Most rivers that can be dammed, have been dammed.
In many aquifers, groundwater is not replenished on the time frame needed.

Obtaining fossil fuels or developing new power sources will be more costly.
Future Population Growth
The rate of increase of the growth rate of the human population is decreasing ( Figure below ).
The population may stop growing by the mid 2000s.
Some scientists think that the human population will peak at about 9 billion people.
What will need to change for the population to stop growing then?
Projection of Earth's population growth
Try to locate on this graph Earth's carrying capacity for humans.
Do you think this projection is very accurate or just a guess?
Humans have exceeded the carrying capacity of Earth for humans by their ingenuity.
The rate of population increase is starting to decline.
The population is still exploding though.
The growth rate is higher in less developed nations.
