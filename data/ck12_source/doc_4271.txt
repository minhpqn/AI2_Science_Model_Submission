Of all the animal species, it is estimated that well over 90% are invertebrates.
Of all invertebrates, the insects are by far the most numerous.
There are so many species of insects that scientists have yet to discover them all, let alone name or count them.
Estimates of the total number of insect species fall in the range of 1 to 30 million.
So, it helps if there are methods to classify not just the insects, but all invertebrates.
Classification of Invertebrates
Eight major phyla contain the majority of invertebrate species.
Major Invertebrate Phyla
Table below gives an overview of the eight invertebrate phyla with the greatest number of species.
multicellularity, specialized cells but no tissues, asymmetry, incomplete digestive system
Cnidaria (jellyfish, corals)
radial symmetry, true tissues, incomplete digestive system
Platyhelminthes (flatworms, tapeworms, flukes)
cephalization, bilateral symmetry, mesoderm, complete digestive system
pseudocoelom, complete digestive system
Mollusca (snails, clams, squids)
true coelom, organ systems, some with primitive brain
Annelida (earthworms, leeches, marine worms)
segmented body, primitive brain
Arthropoda (insects, spiders, crustaceans, centipedes)
