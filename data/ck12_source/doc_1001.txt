An electron has a rest mass of 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \ \text{kg} .
If the electron were traveling at 0.50 c relative to an observer, what electron mass would the observer measure?
M=\frac{m_o}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\frac{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \ \text{kg}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.50 \ c)^2}{c^2}}}=\frac{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \ \text{kg}}{\sqrt{1-0.25}}=1.1 \times 10^{-30} \ \text{kg}
The Ultimate Speed Limit
A result of the special theory of relativity is that no physical object can equal or exceed the speed of light.
From the equation for relativistic mass, it can be seen that as the object is accelerated faster and faster, its mass becomes greater and greater.
The greater mass would require an even greater force to accelerate it.
If the velocity of the mass ever reached the speed of light, the denominator of the equation would become zero and the mass would become infinite.
The energy required to accelerate an infinite mass would also be infinite.
The fact that light itself travels at the speed c , implies that light has a zero rest mass.
Of course, light is never at rest.
The Equivalence of Mass and Energy
The special theory of relativity is also the origin of Einstein’s most famous equation, E = mc^2 , and the concept that mass and energy are different forms of the same thing.
Einstein himself described the equivalence of mass and energy as the “most important upshot of the special theory of relativity”.
The idea is not that mass and energy can be mathematically related but that they two are, in fact, simply different forms of the same thing.
Each may be converted into the other and the conversion factor is the speed of light squared.
Example Problem:
How much energy would be released if a  \pi meson (\text{rest mass}= 2.4 \times 10^{-28} \ \text{kg}) was transformed by decay completely into energy?
Solution:
E = mc^2 = (2.4 \times 10^{-28} \ \text{kg})(3.0 \times 10^8 \ \text{m/s})^2 = 2.2 \times 10^{-11} \ \text{joules}
