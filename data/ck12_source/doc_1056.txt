Some of the concepts presented in this text can be illustrated by features seen in the field.
Where possible, photos are provided to illustrate concepts.
So we can get some of the benefit of going on a field trip!
Some of the places that are featured in this text are described below.
Map of major geographic features of California
California has a lot of different environments and a complex geologic history.
California is a great place to study geology!
In the satellite image above ( Figure above ), it is possible to identify the major geographic (physical) features of California.
The Coast Range runs the length of the state along the Pacific coast.
A tremendous amount of rain falls in the northern part of the range, so the region is heavily forested.
There is less rainfall and vegetation further south.
The Central Valley is made up of the Sacramento and San Joaquin river valleys.
The Central Valley runs through about half of the central part of the state.
The valley is located between the mountains of the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada.
The Central Valley is one of the most important agricultural regions in the world.
The Sierra Nevada Mountain range lies east of the Central Valley.
In the winter, the mountains are covered by snow.
In this image, there is little to no snow, and the bare rocks of the high peaks are showing.
Yosemite National Park lies within the Sierra Nevada.
East of the Sierra Nevada and into the state of Nevada, the climate is very arid.
