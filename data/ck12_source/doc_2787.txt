Compare and contrast the solute and solvent of a solution.
Describe an example of a gaseous solute dissolved in a liquid solvent.
Explain the expression “like dissolves like,” and give an example.
Outline how sodium chloride dissolves in water.
Rate of Dissolving
Identify factors that affect the rate of dissolving.
If you’re like Tanya in this picture, you prefer your iced tea sweetened with sugar.
Sweetened iced tea is a solution in which solid sugar (the solute) is dissolved in cold liquid tea, which is mostly water (the solvent).
When you add sugar to tea, particles of water pull apart particles of sugar.
The particles of sugar spread throughout the tea, making all of it taste sweet.
Factors That Affect the Rate of Dissolving
Did you ever get impatient and start drinking a sweetened drink before all the sugar has dissolved?
As you drink the last few drops, you notice that some of the sugar is sitting on the bottom of the container.
Q:
What could you do to dissolve the sugar faster?
A:
The rate of dissolving is influenced by several factors, including stirring, temperature of solvent, and size of solute particles.
