In some species, the same individual produces both sperm and eggs.
But worms mate to exchange sperm, rather than self-fertilizing their own eggs.
Fertilized eggs are deposited in a mucous cocoon.
Offspring emerge from the cocoon looking like small adults.
They grow to adult size without going through a larval stage.
In polychaete species, there are separate sexes.
Adult worms go through a major transformation to develop reproductive organs.
This occurs in many adults at once.
Then they all swim to the surface and release their gametes in the water, where fertilization takes place.
Offspring go through a larval stage before developing into adults.
Ecology of Annelids
Annelids live in a diversity of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats.
They vary in what they feed on and how they obtain their food.
Earthworms are deposit feeders.
They burrow through the ground, eating soil and extracting organic matter from it.
Earthworm feces, called worm casts, are very rich in plant nutrients.
Earthworm burrows help aerate soil, which is also good for plants.
Polychaetes live on the ocean floor.
They may be sedentary filter feeders, active predators, or scavengers.
Active species crawl along the ocean floor in search of food.
