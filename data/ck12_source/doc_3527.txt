Because it is separated from the cytosol, the space inside the vesicle can be made to be chemically different from the cytosol.
Vesicles are basic tools of the cell for organizing metabolism, transport, and storage of molecules.
Vesicles are also used as chemical reaction chambers.
They can be classified by their contents and function.
Transport vesicles are able to move molecules between locations inside the cell.
For example, transport vesicles move proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
Lysosomes are vesicles that are formed by the Golgi apparatus.
They contain powerful enzymes that could break down (digest) the cell.
Lysosomes break down harmful cell products, waste materials, and cellular debris and then force them out of the cell.
They also digest invading organisms such as bacteria.
Lysosomes also break down cells that are ready to die, a process called autolysis.
Peroxisomes are vesicles that use oxygen to break down toxic substances in the cell.
Unlike lysosomes, which are formed by the Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes self-replicate by growing bigger and then dividing.
They are common in liver and kidney cells that break down harmful substances.
Peroxisomes are named for the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) that is produced when they break down organic compounds.
Hydrogen peroxide is toxic, and in turn is broken down into water (H 2 O) and oxygen (O 2 ) molecules.
Vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles that can have secretory, excretory, and storage functions.
Many organisms will use vacuoles as storage areas and some plant cells have very large vacuoles.
Vesicles are much smaller than vacuoles and function in transporting materials both within and to the outside of the cell.
Centrioles are rod-like structures made of short microtubules.
