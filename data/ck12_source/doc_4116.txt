Darwin observed thirteen distinct finch species on the Gal√°pagos Islands that had evolved from the same ancestor.
Different finch populations lived on separate islands with different environments.
They evolved to best adapt to those particular environments.
Later, scientists were able to determine which finches had evolved into distinct species by bringing members of each population together.
The birds that could not mate were a separate species.
When the Grand Canyon in Arizona formed, two populations of one squirrel species were separated by the giant canyon.
After thousands of years of isolation from each other, the squirrel populations on the northern wall of the canyon looked and behaved differently from those on the southern wall ( Figure below ).
North rim squirrels have white tails and black bellies.
Squirrels on the south rim have white bellies and dark tails.
They cannot mate with each other, so they are different species.
The Abert squirrel and Kaibab squirrel are from opposite sides of the Grand Canyon

Isolation without Physical Separation
Sympatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than physical or geographic separation.
The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is an example of such separation.
The separation may be caused by different mating seasons, for example.
Sympatric speciation is more difficult to identify.
Here are two examples of sympatric speciation:
Some scientists suspect that two groups of orcas (killer whales) live in the same part of the Pacific Ocean part of the year but do not mate.
