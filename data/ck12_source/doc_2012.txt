Limnology is the study of the plants and animals that live in fresh water bodies.
A lake has zones just like the ocean.
The ecosystem of a lake is divided into three distinct zones ( Figure below ):
The surface (littoral) zone is the sloped area closest to the edge of the water.
The open-water zone (also called the photic zone ) has sunlight.
The deep-water zone (also called the aphotic zone ) has little or no sunlight.
There are several life zones found within a lake:
In the littoral zone , sunlight allows plants to grow.
Plants provide food and shelter to animals such as snails, insects, and fish.
Other plants and fish live in the open-water zone.
These include bass and trout.
The deep-water zone is dark so there is no photosynthesis.
Most deep-water organisms are scavengers.
They feed on dead organisms that fall to the bottom of the lake.
Crabs and catfish are two of these types of organisms.
Fungi and bacteria are decomposers that live in the deep zone.

The three primary zones of a lake are the littoral, open-water, and deep-water zones.
Some of Earthâ€™s freshwater is found in wetlands.
A wetland is an area that is covered with water, or at least has very soggy soil, during all or part of the year.
