So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane.
But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge.
Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane.
The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level.
Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ).
High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes.
High winds can also create very big waves.
If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore.
If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.
Storm surge can cause serious flooding.
There are about 100 hurricanes around the world each year.
There are many smaller tropical storms and tropical depressions.
As people develop coastal regions, property damage from storms continues to rise.
However, scientists are becoming better at predicting storms.
Fatalities are decreasing.
The one major exception was Hurricane Katrina.
The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was unprecedented.
The hurricane season was longer than normal, and there were many more storms.
