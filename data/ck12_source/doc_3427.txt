The theory of evolution by natural selection is a classic scientific theory.
With repeated testing, some hypotheses may eventually become scientific theories.
Keep in mind, a hypothesis is a possible answer to a scientific question.
A scientific theory is a broad explanation for events that is widely accepted as true.
To become a theory, a hypothesis must be tested over and over again, and it must be supported by a great deal of evidence.
People commonly use the word theory to describe a guess about how or why something happens.
For example, you might say, “I think a woodchuck dug this hole in the ground, but it’s just a theory.” Using the word theory in this way is different from the way it is used in science.
A scientific theory is more like a fact than a guess because it is so well-supported.
There are several well-known theories in biology, including the theory of evolution, cell theory, and germ theory.

The Theory of Evolution
The theory of evolution by natural selection is a scientific theory.
Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time.
