The point where the rock ruptures is the earthquake’s focus .
The focus is below the Earth’s surface.
A shallow earthquake has a focus less than 70 kilometers (45 miles).
An intermediate-focus earthquake has a focus between 70 and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles).
A deep-focus earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles).
About 75% of earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust.
Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage.
This is because the focus is near the Earth's surface, where people live.
The area just above the focus, on the land surface, is the earthquake’s epicenter ( Figure below ).
The towns or cities near the epicenter will be strongly affected by the earthquake.
The epicenter and focus of an earthquake
The focus of an earthquake is where the ground breaks.
The epicenter is the point at the surface just above the focus.
A sudden release of energy stored in rocks causes an earthquake.
The focus is where the rocks rupture.
The epicenter is the point on the ground directly above the focus.
Most earthquakes are shallow.
Shallow earthquakes do the most damage.
