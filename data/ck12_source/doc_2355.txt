Change this variable while controlling the others, and observe how it affects the movement of the object down the ramp.
What are your manipulated variable and control variables?
What is the responding variable?
How does the responding variable change when you increase the value of the manipulated variable?
What is an experiment?
Distinguish between the manipulated variable and the responding variable in an experiment.
Why is it important for other variables in an experiment to be controlled?
Define field study.
Identify reasons why a field study might be done.
The environmental chemist in this photo is “fishing” for a sample of river water.
He works for the US Environmental Protection Agency.
He is looking for evidence of pollution in the water.
Doing Science in the Field
Although experiments are the “gold standard” for scientific investigations, sometimes it’s not possible or desirable to do experiments.
Often it’s important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab.
An investigation that gathers evidence in the real world—as the environmental chemist above is doing—is called a field study .
Q:
Why are field studies important for environmental scientists?
A:
To learn about the environment, scientists need to take measurements and make observations in the real world.
