Conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone have different sediment sizes
Conglomerates have larger clasts than sandstone, which have larger clasts than mudstone.
Chemical Sedimentary Rocks
Chemical sedimentary rocks form when crystals precipitate out from a liquid.
The mineral halite, also called rock salt, forms this way.
You can make halite!
Leave a shallow dish of salt water out in the Sun.
As the water evaporates, salt crystals form in the dish.
There are other chemical sedimentary rocks, like gypsum ( Figure below ).
Gypsum is a chemical sedimentary rock
Gypsum, with its rose-like structure, is a chemical sedimentary rock.
Compaction and cementation lead to lithification of sedimentary rocks.
Sediments are compacted by the weight of the rocks and sediments above them.
Sediments are cemented by fluids that bind sediments together.
Minerals precipitate to form sedimentary rocks.
