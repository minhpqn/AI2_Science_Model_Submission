Technology and Society
Summarize how major advances in technology impact human society.
Describe how the Industrial Revolution affected peopleâ€™s lives.
The Mars Rover pictured here is a wheeled robot developed by NASA.
Its job is to explore the surface of Mars.
The rover contains a lot of complex modern technology.
But how it moves by rolling on wheels is a very old invention.
The wheel was probably invented many times in different cultures, beginning at least 10,000 years ago.
In addition to wheeled carts and chariots, early wheels were used for water wheels, grinding wheels, and wheels for spinning pottery.
