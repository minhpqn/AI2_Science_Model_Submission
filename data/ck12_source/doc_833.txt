Different terrestrial biomes are usually defined in terms of their plants, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses.
Factors such as latitude, humidity, and elevation affect biome type:
Latitude means how far a biome is from the equator.
Moving from the poles to the equator, you will find (in order) Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, and tropical biomes.
Humidity is the amount of water in the air.
Air with a high concentration of water will be called humid.
Moving away from the most humid climate, biomes will be called semi-humid, semi-arid, or arid (the driest).
Elevation measures how high land is above sea level.
It gets colder as you go higher above sea level, which is why you see snow-capped mountains.
Terrestrial biomes include grasslands, forests, deserts, and tundra.
Grasslands are characterized as lands dominated by grasses rather than large shrubs or trees and include the savanna and temperate grasslands.
Forests are dominated by trees and other woody vegetation and are classified based on their latitude.
Forests include tropical, temperate, and boreal forests (taiga).
Deserts cover about one fifth of the Earthâ€™s surface and occur where rainfall is less than 50 cm (about 20 inches) each year.
Tundra is the coldest of all the biomes.
The tundra is characterized for its frost-molded landscapes, extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and short growing seasons.
There are two main types of tundra, Arctic and Alpine tundras.
Terrestrial biomes ( Figure below ) lying within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles do not have very much plant or animal life.
Biomes with the highest amount of biodiversity , that is the most variation in plant and animal life, are near the equator ( Figure below ).
Taiga is characterized by evergreen forests in the subarctic regions, and covers large areas of northern North America and Eurasia
