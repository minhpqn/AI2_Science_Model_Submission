When atoms give up or accept electrons in this way, they become charged particles called ions.
The ions are held together by ionic bonds, which form an ionic compound.
Ionic compounds generally form between elements that are metals and elements that are nonmetals.
For example, the metal calcium (Ca) and the nonmetal chlorine (Cl) form the ionic compound calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ).
In this compound, there are two negative chloride ions for each positive calcium ion.
Because the positive and negative charges cancel out, an ionic compound is neutral in charge.
Q:
Now can you explain why calcium chloride prevents ice from forming on a snowy road?
A:
If calcium chloride dissolves in water, it breaks down into its ions (Ca 2+ and Cl - ).
When water has ions dissolved in it, it has a lower freezing point.
Pure water freezes at 0°C.
With calcium and chloride ions dissolved in it, it won’t freeze unless the temperature reaches -29°C or lower.
Many compounds form molecules, but ionic compounds form crystals instead.
A crystal consists of many alternating positive and negative ions bonded together in a matrix.
Look at the crystal of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the Figure below .
The sodium and chloride ions are attracted to each other because they are oppositely charged, so they form ionic bonds.
Sodium chloride crystals are cubic in shape
Sodium chloride crystals are cubic in shape.
Other ionic compounds may have crystals with different shapes.
