Only then will she slow down.
Velocity is a measure of both speed and direction of motion.
A change in velocity is called acceleration.
In the case of the sprinter, she accelerates as she runs down the track because her speed is changing even though her direction stays the same.
If you need a review of acceleration, watch the musical video at this URL:

Plotting Velocity Against Time
The changing velocity of the sprinter—or of any other moving person or object—can be represented by a velocity-time graph like the one in the Figure below for the sprinter.
A velocity-time graph shows how velocity changes over time.
The sprinter’s velocity increases for the first 4 seconds of the race, it remains constant for the next 3 seconds, and it decreases during the last 3 seconds after she crosses the finish line.

Acceleration and Slope
In a velocity-time graph, acceleration is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line.
If the line slopes upward, like the line between 0 and 4 seconds in the Figure above , velocity is increasing, so acceleration is positive.
If the line is horizontal, as it is between 4 and 7 seconds, velocity is constant and acceleration is zero.
If the line slopes downward, like the line between 7 and 10 seconds, velocity is decreasing and acceleration is negative.
Negative acceleration is called deceleration.
Q:
Assume that another sprinter is running the same race.
The other runner reaches a top velocity of 9 m/s by 4 seconds after the start of the race.
