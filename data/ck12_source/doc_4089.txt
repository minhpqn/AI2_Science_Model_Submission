For example, tortoises that ate plants near the ground had rounded shells and shorter necks.
Tortoises on islands with tall shrubs had longer necks and shells that bent upward, allowing them to stretch their necks ( Figure below ).
Darwin began to hypothesize that organisms developed traits over time because of differences in their environments.
Darwin began to think that organisms evolved adaptations that allowed them to live in their environment.
These adaptations were beneficial traits for their environment.
Giant tortoises on the Galapagos Islands
The name “Galápagos” means “giant tortoise.” When Darwin arrived on the Galápagos Islands, he was amazed by the size and variety of shapes of these animals.
The giant tortoise (left) is a unique animal found only in the Galápagos Islands.
There are only about 200 tortoises remaining on these islands.
This Pinta Island tortoise (right) is able to reach leaves high in shrubs with its long neck and curved shell.
The most studied animals on the Galápagos are finches, a type of bird ( Figure below ).
When Darwin first observed finches on the islands, he did not even realize they were all finches.
But when he studied them further, he realized they were related to each other.
Each island had its own distinct species of finch.
The birds on different islands had many similarities, but their beaks differed in size and shape.
Drawing of Darwin's finches
Four of Darwin’s finch species from the Galápagos Islands.
The birds came from the same finch ancestor.
They evolved as they adapted to different food resources on different islands.
The first bird uses its large beak to crack open and eat large seeds.
