An example is pictured below ( Figure above ).
Deposition by Flood Waters
A flood occurs when a river overflows it banks.
This might happen because of heavy rains.
As the water spreads out over the land, it slows down and drops its sediment.
If a river floods often, the floodplain develops a thick layer of rich soil because of all the deposits.
That’s why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants.
For example, the Nile River in Egypt provides both water and thick sediments for raising crops in the middle of a sandy desert.
A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks.
A levee ( Figure below ) is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the water’s edge.
Levees occur because floodwaters deposit their biggest sediments first when they overflow the river’s banks.
How natural levees form from floods
This diagram shows how a river builds natural levees along its banks.
Streams carry dissolved ions and sediments.
The sizes of the sediments a stream can carry, its competence, depend on the stream's velocity.
Particles that are too large to be suspended move along the stream bed by saltation.
Rivers deposit sediments on levees, floodplains, and in deltas and alluvial fans.
