The Photosynthesis Reaction - Advanced
Summarize the process of photosynthesis and write out the overall chemical equation for photosynthesis.
Identify reactants, necessary conditions, and products in the chemical equation for photosynthesis.
Understand that hundreds of years of scientific exploration have contributed to our understanding of photosynthesis.
What is the most common biochemical reaction ever?
Well, it may or may not be this one.
Every split second that sunlight strikes a plant's leaf, the process of photosynthesis begins.
That's on every leaf, on every plant, including all the blades of grass.
All over the world.
Photosynthesis:
The Most Important Chemical Reaction for Life on Earth
What do pizza, campfires, dolphins, automobiles, and glaciers have in common?
In the following section, you’ll learn that all five rely on photosynthesis, some in more ways than one.
Photosynthesis is often considered the most important chemical reaction for life on earth.
Let’s delve into how this process works and why we are so indebted to it.
