Evolution and molecules are discussed at
Cladogram of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and babbons
Cladogram of Humans and Apes.
This cladogram is based on DNA comparisons.
It shows how humans are related to apes by descent from common ancestors.
Using various types of information to understand evolutionary relationships is discussed in the following videos:
KQED:
The Reverse Evolution Machine
In search of the common ancestor of all mammals, University of California Santa Cruz scientist David Haussler is pulling a complete reversal.
Instead of studying fossils, he's comparing the genomes of living mammals to construct a map of our common ancestors' DNA.
He also specializes in studying the DNA of extinct animals, asking how the DNA has changed over millions of years to create today's species.
His technique, referred to as computational genomics, holds promise for providing a better picture of how life evolved.

Scientists compare the anatomy, embryos, and DNA of living things to understand how they evolved.
Evidence for evolution is provided by homologous structures.
These are structures shared by related organisms that were inherited from a common ancestor.
Other evidence for evolution is provided by analogous structures.
These are structures that unrelated organisms share because they evolved to do the same job.
Comparing DNA sequences provided some of the strongest evidence of evolutionary relationships.
