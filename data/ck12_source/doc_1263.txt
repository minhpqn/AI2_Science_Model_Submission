What are subduction zones?
What heats Earth's interior?
Describe how convection takes place in the mantle.
How does mantle convection cause seafloor spreading?
How does seafloor spreading move plates?
Theory of Plate Tectonics
Explain the theory of plate tectonics theory.
Describe how plate tectonics leads to existence of supercontinents such as Pangaea.
What would Wegener think?
Like any great theory, plate tectonics makes a tremendous amount of sense.
The whole story fits together so perfectly.
Wegener had so much evidence that the continents had once been joined.
Seafloor spreading is a perfect mechanism for moving those continents.
It's really too bad that Alfred Wegener is not here to learn about the theory of plate tectonics.
It seems certain that he would be ecstatic!
Plate Tectonics Theory
The theory of plate tectonics is what brings together continental drift and seafloor spreading.
Plates are made of lithosphere topped with oceanic and/or continental crust.
The plates are moved around on Earth's surface by seafloor spreading.
Convection in the mantle drives seafloor spreading.
