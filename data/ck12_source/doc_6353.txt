Lithium carbonate is an essential component of lithium batteries, which tend to be longer-lasting than regular alkaline batteries.
The material is obtained from lithium ores by adding CO 2 under high pressure to form the more soluble LiHCO 3 .
The mixture is then depressurized to remove the carbon dioxide and the lithium carbonate precipitates out of solution.
Common Ion Effect
In a saturated solution of calcium sulfate, an equilibrium exists between the solid calcium sulfate and its ions in solution.
\text{CaSO}_4(s) \rightleftarrows \text{Ca}^{2+}(aq)+\text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq) \qquad K_{sp}=2.4 \times 10^{-5}
Suppose that some calcium nitrate were added to this saturated solution.
Immediately, the concentration of the calcium ion in the solution would increase.
As a result, the ion product of the [Ca 2+ ] times the [SO 4 2− ] would increase and now be greater than the K_{sp} .
According to LeChâtelier’s principle, the equilibrium above would shift to the left in order to relieve the stress of the added calcium ion.
Additional calcium sulfate would precipitate out of the solution until the ion product once again becomes equal to the K_{sp} .
Note that in the new equilibrium the concentrations of the calcium ion and the sulfate ion would no longer be equal to each other.
The calcium ion concentration would be larger than the sulfate ion concentration.
