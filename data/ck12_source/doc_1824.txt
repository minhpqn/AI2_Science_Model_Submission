This sets up the soil for erosion.
Soil erosion is a natural occurrence.
However, human activities have greatly accelerated soil erosion.
In some locations, soil may now be eroding about 10 times faster than its natural rate.
Since Europeans settled in the United States, approximately one-third of the topsoil has eroded away.
Soil erosion is a natural process, but human activities can increase it.
The main agents of soil erosion are water and wind.
Soil erosion is more likely where the ground has been disturbed.
Farming, grazing animals, logging, mining, construction, and recreational activities can do this.
