Some chemosynthetic bacteria live around deep-ocean vents known as “black smokers.” Compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, which flow out of the vents from Earth’s interior, are used by the bacteria for energy to make food.
Consumers that depend on these bacteria to produce food for them include giant tubeworms, like those pictured in Figure below .
These organisms are known as chemoautotrophs.
Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and symbiotic associations between these organisms and respiring heterotrophs are quite common.
Tubeworms deep in the Galapagos Rift get their energy from chemosynthetic bacteria.
Tubeworms have no mouth, eyes, or stomach.
Their survival depends on a symbiotic relationship with the billions of bacteria that live inside them.
These bacteria convert the chemicals that shoot out of the hydrothermal vents into food for the worm.
chemoautotrophs :
Organisms that use the energy stored in chemical compounds to make organic molecules by chemosynthesis.
chemosynthesis :
The process by which carbon dioxide molecules are converted to carbohydrates; uses energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.
extremophile :
Any organism that thrives in extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, salinity, or concentrations of hostile chemicals; these are characteristics of the Kingdom Archaea.
Chemosynthesis is a process in which some organisms use chemical energy instead of light energy to produce "food."
What is chemosynthesis?
What is the chemical process of hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis?
Why do bacteria that live deep below the ocean’s surface rely on chemical compounds instead of sunlight for energy to make food?
What are chemoautotrophs?
Give an example.
