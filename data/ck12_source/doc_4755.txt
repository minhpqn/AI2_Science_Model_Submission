Evolutionary theory can explain how specialized features, such as the geckos sticky foot pads shown in Figure below , develop in different species.
More about evolution is discussed in Concept Evolution (Advanced) .
A Tokay Gecko.
The pads at the tip of the Tokay gecko's foot are covered in microscopic hairs, each split into hundreds of tips that measure about 200 nanometers in diameter.
By using these tiny hairs that can cling to smooth surfaces, the geckos are able to support their entire body weight while climbing walls This is evidence of a product of evolution.

Nature as Muse
For hundreds of years, scientists have been using design ideas from structures in nature.
Now, biologists and engineers at the University of California, Berkeley are working together to design a broad range of new products, such as life-saving milli-robots modeled on the way cockroaches run and adhesives based on the amazing design of a geckos foot.
This process starts with making observations of nature, which lead to asking questions and to the additional aspects of the scientific process.
