He kicks it with an initial velocity of 22 \;\mathrm{m/s} at an angle of 55^\circ .
The field goal posts are 3 meters high.
Does he make the field goal?
What is the ballâ€™s velocity and direction of motion just as it reaches the field goal post ( i.e., after it has traveled 40\;\mathrm{m} in the horizontal direction)?
In a football game a punter kicks the ball a horizontal distance of 43 yards (39 \;\mathrm{m}) .
On TV, they track the hang time, which reads 3.9 seconds.
From this information, calculate the angle and speed at which the ball was kicked. (Note for non-football watchers: the projectile starts and lands at the same height.
It goes 43 yards horizontally in a time of 3.9 seconds)

Breaking vectors into components, relative velocity and projectile motion are all covered in this chapter.
