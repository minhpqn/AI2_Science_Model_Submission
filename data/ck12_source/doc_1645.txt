Yes, just like this car, cells cannot last forever.
Cells do eventually wear out.
At that point, they need to be replaced.
This is one reason that your cells divide.
New cells that result after cells divide are also used for growth and to repair cuts.
Why Cells Divide
Imagine the first stages of life.
In humans and other animals, a sperm fertilizes an egg, forming the first cell.
But humans are made up of trillions of cells, so where do the new cells come from?
Remember that according to the cell theory, all cells come from existing cells.
Once a sperm and egg cell unite and the first cell, called a zygote, forms, an entire baby will develop.
And each cell in that baby will be genetically identical, meaning that each cell will have exactly the same DNA.
How does a new life go from one cell to so many?
The cell divides in half, creating two cells.
Then those two cells divide, for a total of four cells.
The new cells continue to divide and divide.
One cell becomes two, then four, then eight, and so on ( Figure below ).
This continual process of a cell dividing and creating two new cells is known as cell division.
Cell division is part of a cycle of cellular growth and division known as the cell cycleâ€”cells must grow before they divide.
The cell cycle describes the "life" of a eukayrotic cell.
