substitution reaction:
A reaction in which one or more atoms replace another atom or group of atoms in a molecule.
Define addition reaction.
Give examples of addition reactions.
Margarine is created by the reduction of vegetable oils
What is this yellow stuff?
There is big debate these days about using butter or margarine on your toast (or pancakes or muffin).
Margarine is less expensive than butter and is lower in fat and cholesterol.
Margarine is made from animal or vegetable fats using hydrogenation to reduce the double bonds in the fatty acids.
Hydrogen gas is bubbled through the liquid oil and reacts with the carbon-carbon double bonds present in the long-chain fatty acids.
The product is less likely to spoil than butter.
An addition reaction is a reaction in which an atom or molecule is added to an unsaturated molecule, making a single product .
An addition reaction can be thought of as adding a molecule across the double or triple bond of an alkene or alkyne.
Addition reactions are useful ways to introduce a new functional group into an organic molecule.
One type of addition reaction is called hydrogenation.
Hydrogenation is a reaction that occurs when molecular hydrogen is added to an alkene to produce an alkane.
The reaction is typically performed with the use of a platinum catalyst.
Ethene reacts with hydrogen to form ethane.
\text{CH}_2\text{=CH}_2 (g) + \text{H}_2 (g) \xrightarrow{\text{Pt}} \text{CH}_3 \text{CH}_3 (g)
Alkyl halides can be produced from an alkene by the addition of either the elemental halogen or the hydrogen halide.
