gene expression :
The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.
helix-loop-helix :
A major structural motif of proteins capable of binding DNA; characterized by two α helices connected by a loop.
helix-turn-helix :
A major structural motif of proteins capable of binding DNA; composed of two α helices joined by a short strand of amino acids.
homeobox :
A 180 base pair long highly conserved segment of DNA; encodes a 60 amino acid domain within the protein (known as the homeodomain), which can bind DNA.
leucine-zipper :
A major structural motif of proteins capable of binding DNA; found in certain transcription factors; uses leucine residues in an α helical structure to hold two subunits together.
preinitiation complex :
A large complex of proteins that is necessary for the transcription of protein-coding genes in eukaryotes; helps position RNA polymerase II; also found in archaea genes.
promoter :
A segment of DNA that allows a gene to be transcribed; segment where RNA polymerase binds to start transcription.
protein kinase C (PKC) :
A family of protein kinase enzymes that are involved in controlling the function of other proteins through serine and threonine phosphorylation; important in signal transduction.
specificity protein 1 (Sp1) :
A transcription factor involved in gene expression in the early development of an organism.
TATA binding protein :
A general transcription factor that binds specifically to the TATA box.
