A photon is a quantum of electromagnetic radiation.
probability distribution:
In quantum mechanics, the probability distribution is a mathematical function that gives the probability of finding a particle in any small region of space.
Schrodingerâ€™s equation:
An equation describing the state and evolution of a quantum mechanical system, given boundary conditions.
Different solutions to the equation are associated with different wave functions, usually associated with different energy levels.
This equation is fundamental to the study of wave mechanics.
orbital:
The wave function of an electron in an atom or molecule, indicating the electron's probable location.
quantum number:
A number used when describing the energy levels available to atoms and molecules.
An electron in an atom or ion has four quantum numbers to describe its state.
Describe a laser and the properties of laser light.
Laser in operation
An U.
S.
Air Force scientist operates a laser in a test environment.
The United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) conducts research on a variety of solid-state and chemical lasers.
Most types of laser are an inherently pure source of light; they emit near-monochromatic light with a very well defined range of wavelengths.
By careful design of the laser components, the purity of the laser light can be improved more than the purity of any other light source.
