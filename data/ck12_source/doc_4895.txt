Bacteria, being single-celled organisms, cannot just get up and walk from place to place.
So they have to "swim." To do this, they must have some sort of structure that propels them through their environment.
Such a tail-like structure is a flagellum or set of flagella.
These protein containing structures spin around a biological motor, allowing the bacteria to move.
External Structures of the Cell
Flagella ( flagellum , singular) are long, thin structures that protrude from the cell membrane.
Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells can have flagella.
Flagella help single-celled organisms move or swim towards food.
The flagella of eukaryotic cells are normally used for movement too, such as in the movement of sperm cells, which have only a single flagellum.
The flagella of either group are very different from each other.
Prokaryotic flagella, shown in Figure below , are spiral-shaped and stiff.
They spin around in a fixed base much like a screw does, which moves the cell in a tumbling fashion.
Eukaryotic flagella are made of microtubules that bend and flex like a whip.
Bacterial flagella spin about in place, which causes the bacterial cell to "tumble."
Cilia ( cilium , singular) are made up of microtubule containing extensions of the cell membrane.
Although both cilia and flagella are used for movement, cilia are much shorter than flagella.
Cilia cover the surface of some single-celled organisms, such as paramecium.
Their cilia beat together to move the little animal-like protists through the water.
In multicellular animals, including humans, cilia are usually found in large numbers on a single surface of cells.
Multicellular animals' cilia usually move materials inside the body.
