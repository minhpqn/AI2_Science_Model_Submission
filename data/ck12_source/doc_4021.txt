The image at bottom right is an SEM of HIV budding from cultured lymphocyte.
The many round bumps on the cell surface are sites of assembly and budding of virions.
An HIV Infection
An HIV infection of a CD4 cell can be summarized as follows:
First, the viral particle attaches to the CD4 receptor and other associated receptors on the cell membrane.
The viral envelope then fuses with the cell membrane, and the viral capsid moves into the cell.
Once the viral capsid enters the cell, reverse transcriptase frees the single-stranded RNA from the viral proteins and copies it into a complementary strand of DNA.
This process of reverse transcription is error-prone and it is during this step that mutations may occur.
Such mutations may cause drug resistance.
The reverse transcriptase then makes a complementary DNA strand to form a double-stranded viral DNA (vDNA).
The vDNA is then moved into the cell nucleus.
The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase .
This integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, during the latent stage of the HIV infection.
Clinical latency for HIV can vary between two weeks and 20 years.
To actively produce viruses, certain cellular transcription factors need to be present.
These transcription factors are plentiful in activated T cells.
This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection.
