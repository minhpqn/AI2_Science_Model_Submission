Example Problem:
A positive test charge of 2.0 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{C} is placed in an electric field.
The force on the test charge is 0.60 N.
What is the electric field intensity at the location of the test charge?
Solution:
E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{0.60 \ \text{N}}{2.0 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{C}}=3.0 \times 10^4 \ \text{N/C}
An electric field surrounds every charge and acts on other charges in the vicinity.
The strength of the electric field is given by the symbol E , and has the unit of Newtons/coulomb .
The equation for electric field intensity is E=\frac{F}{q} .
