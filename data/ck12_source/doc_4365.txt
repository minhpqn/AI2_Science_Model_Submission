Describe structure and function in amphibians.
So how did vertebrates move from the water onto land?
There had to be some major modifications.
Modifications in how the animal moves, how the animal breathes, and modifications in the animals skin.
Structure and Function in Amphibians
Amphibians are vertebrates that exist in two worlds: they divide their time between freshwater and terrestrial habitats.
They share a number of features with air-breathing lungfish, but they also differ from lungfish in many ways.
One way they differ is their appendages.
Modern amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, as shown Figure below .

In what ways do these three amphibians appear to be similar?
In what ways do they appear to be different?
Amphibians are the first true tetrapods , or vertebrates with four limbs.
Amphibians have less variation in size than fish, ranging in length from 1 centimeter (2.5 inches) to 1.5 meters (about 5 feet).
They generally have moist skin without scales.
Their skin contains keratin , a tough, fibrous protein found in the skin, scales, feathers, hair, and nails of tetrapod vertebrates, from amphibians to humans.
Some forms of keratin are tougher than others.
The form in amphibian skin is not very tough, and it allows gases and water to pass through their skin.
Amphibians are ectothermic , so their internal body temperature is generally about the same as the temperature of their environment.
