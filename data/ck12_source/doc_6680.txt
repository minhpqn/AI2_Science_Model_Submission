The letter g is used as the symbol for the acceleration of gravity.
When talking about an object's acceleration, whether it is due to gravity or not, the acceleration of gravity is sometimes used as a unit of measurement where 1g=9.8m/s^2 .
So an object accelerating at 2g's is accelerating at 2*9.8m/s^2 or 19.6m/s^2
Deceleration is the term used when an object’s speed (i.e. magnitude of its velocity) is decreasing due to acceleration in the opposite direction of its velocity.
A Top Fuel dragster can accelerate from 0 to 100 mph (160 km/hr) in 0.8 seconds.
What is the average acceleration in m/s^2 ?
Question: a_{avg} = ? \ [m/s^2]
Given: v_i = 0 \ m/s
{\;} \qquad \ \ v_f = 160 \ km/hr
{\;} \qquad \ \quad t = 0.8 \ s
Equation: a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v }{t}
Plug n’ Chug:
Step 1:
Convert km/hr to m/s
v_f = \left( 160 \frac{km}{hr} \right ) \left( \frac{1,000 \ m}{1 \ km} \right ) \left ( \frac{1 \ hr}{3,600 \ s} \right ) = 44.4 \ m/s
Step 2:
Solve for average acceleration:
a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{44.4 \ m/s - 0 \ m/s}{0.8 \ s} = 56 \ m/s^2
Answer: \boxed {\mathbf{56 \ m/s^2}} Note that this is over 5 \frac{1}{2} g’s!
