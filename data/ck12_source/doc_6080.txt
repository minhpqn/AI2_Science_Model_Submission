Read the section of the material at the link below that deals specifically with water:
Why does the melting point of ice get lower at higher pressures?
Can you compress steam to form a liquid if the temperature is above 374Â°C?
What is the critical pressure of water?
What happens to solid ice under high pressure near the freezing point?
What is the critical temperature?
What is the critical pressure?
critical point:
The intersection point of the critical temperature and the critical pressure.
critical pressure:
The pressure that must be applied to the gas at the critical temperature in order to turn it into a liquid.
critical temperature:
The highest temperature at which the substance can possibly exist as a liquid.
