As the temperature increases at a constant pressure, the substance changes from solid to liquid to gas.
Start right above point  B on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically.
At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state.
As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together.
Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state.
Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify.
For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid.
The line segment R-S represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas.
At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist.
The point labeled  TP is called the triple point .
The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.
A phase diagram is a graph which the conditions of temperature and pressure under which a substance exists in the solid, liquid, and gas.
The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.
