A protein is a peptide that is greater than one hundred amino acids in length.
Proteins are very prevalent in living organisms.
Hair, skin, nails, muscles, and the hemoglobin in red blood cells are some of the important parts of your body that are made of different proteins.
The wide array of chemical and physiological properties of proteins is a function of their amino acid sequences.
Since proteins generally consist of one hundred or more amino acids, the number of amino acid sequences that are possible is virtually limitless.
The three-dimensional structure of a protein is very critical to its function.
This structure can be broken down into four levels.
The primary structure is the amino acid sequence of the protein.
The amino acid sequence of a given protein is unique and defines the function of that protein.
The secondary structure is a highly regular sub-structure of the protein.
The two most common types of protein secondary structure are the alpha helix and the beta sheet.
An alpha helix consists of amino acids that adopt a spiral shape.
A beta sheet is alternating rows of amino acids that line up in a side-by-side fashion.
In both cases, the secondary structures are stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding between the side chains.
The interaction of the various side chains in the amino acid, specifically the hydrogen bonding, leads to the adoption of a particular secondary structure.
Structure of alpha helices and beta sheets
Secondary structure: alpha helix and beta sheet.
The tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional structure of the protein.
A typical protein consists of several sections of a specific secondary structure (alpha helix or beta sheet) along with other areas in which a more random structure occurs.
These areas combine to produce the tertiary structure.
