Though fungal infections can be annoying, they are rarely as serious or deadly as bacterial or viral infections.
A ringworm infection is an example of a fungal infection
Ringworm isn’t a worm at all.
It’s a disease caused by a fungus.
The fungus causes a ring-shaped rash on the skin, like the one shown here.
Protozoa are one-celled organisms with a nucleus, making them eukaryotic organisms.
They cause diseases such as malaria.
Malaria is a serious disease that is common in warm climates.
The protozoa infect people when they are bit by a mosquito.
More than a million people die of malaria each year.
Other protozoa cause diarrhea.
An example is Giardia lamblia ( Figure below ).
This picture shows a one-celled organism called Giardia lamblia .
It is a protozoan that causes diarrhea.
Viruses are nonliving collections of protein and DNA that must reproduce inside of living cells.
Viruses cause many common diseases.
For example, viruses cause colds and the flu.
Cold sores are caused by the virus Herpes simplex ( Figure below ).
Antibiotics do not affect viruses, because antibiotics only kill bacteria.
But medicines called antiviral drugs can treat many diseases caused by viruses.
