History of Earth compressed into one day
History of Earth in a Day.
In this model of Earth’s history, the planet formed at midnight.
What time was it when the first prokaryotes evolved?
Learning About the Past
Much of what we know about the history of life on Earth is based on the fossil record.
Detailed knowledge of modern organisms also helps us understand how life evolved.
The Fossil Record
Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past.
The soft parts of organisms almost always decompose quickly after death.
On occasion, the hard parts—mainly bones, teeth, or shells—remain long enough to mineralize and form fossils.
An example of a complete fossil skeleton is shown in Figure below .
The fossil record is the record of life that unfolded over four billion years and pieced back together through the analysis of fossils.
Fossil of an extinct lion
Extinct Lion Fossil.
This fossilized skeleton represents an extinct lion species.
It is rare for fossils to be so complete and well preserved as this one.
To be preserved as fossils, remains must be covered quickly by sediments or preserved in some other way.
For example, they may be frozen in glaciers or trapped in tree resin, like the frog in Figure below .
Sometimes traces of organisms—such as footprints or burrows—are preserved (see the fossil footprints in Figure below ).
