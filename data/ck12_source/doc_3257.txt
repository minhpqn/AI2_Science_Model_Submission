Turn on the Lights
If you’re like most people, you don’t give it a thought when you flick a switch to turn on a light—at least not until the power goes out and you’re left in the dark!
When you flick on a light switch, electricity normally flows through the light, and some type of light bulb converts the electrical energy to visible light.
This can happen in various ways, depending on the type of light bulb.
Several different types of light bulbs are described below.
All of them are examples of artificial light , as opposed to natural light from the sun or other sources in nature.
An incandescent light bulb like the one pictured in the Figure below produces visible light by incandescence.
Incandescence occurs when something gets so hot that it glows.
An incandescent light bulb contains a thin wire filament made of tungsten.
When electric current passes through the filament, it gets extremely hot and emits light.
A fluorescent light bulb produces visible light by fluorescence.
Fluorescence occurs when a substance absorbs shorter-wavelength ultraviolet light and then gives off the energy as visible light.
The compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) in the Figure below contains mercury gas that gives off ultraviolet light when electricity passes through it.
The inside of the bulb is coated with a substance called phosphor.
Phosphor absorbs the ultraviolet light and then gives off most of the energy as visible light.
A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence.
In this process, neon or some other gas gives off light when an electric current passes through it.
Other halogen gases besides neon—including krypton and argon—also produce light in this way.
The word “OPEN” in the sign below is a neon light.
It is a long glass tube that contains neon gas.
