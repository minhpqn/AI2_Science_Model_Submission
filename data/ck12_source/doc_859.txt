The Nitrogen Cycle
Describe the key features of the nitrogen cycle.
Define nitrogen fixation.
Explain assimilation and denitrification.
What can bean plants do that most other plants can't?
No, they don't grow giant stalks to the clouds.
Bean plants and other legumes (plants that have their seeds in pods) can use the nitrogen in the air to grow.
It takes the help of special bacteria friends in the soil, and this relationship is unique to the legumes.
The Nitrogen Cycle
Like water and carbon, nitrogen is also repeatedly recycled through the biosphere.
This process is called the nitrogen cycle .
Nitrogen is one of the most common elements in living organisms.
It is important for creating both proteins and nucleic acids, like DNA.
The air that we breathe is mostly nitrogen gas (N 2 ), but, unfortunately, animals and plants cannot use the nitrogen when it is a gas.
In fact, plants often die from a lack of nitrogen even through they are surrounded by plenty of nitrogen gas.
Nitrogen gas (N 2 ) has two nitrogen atoms connected by a very strong triple bond.
Most plants and animals cannot use the nitrogen in nitrogen gas because they cannot break that triple bond.
In order for plants to make use of nitrogen, it must be transformed into molecules they can use.
This can be accomplished several different ways ( Figure below ).
