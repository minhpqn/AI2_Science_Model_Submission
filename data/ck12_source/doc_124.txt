These include ducks, geese, swans, and pelicans, to name a few.

Parrots have down-curved, hooked bills, which are well-adapted for cracking seeds and nuts ( Figure below ).
Hummingbirds, on the other hand, have long, thin, pointed bills, which are adapted for getting the nectar out of flowers ( Figure below ).
Hawks, eagles, falcons and owls have a sharp, hooked beak.
