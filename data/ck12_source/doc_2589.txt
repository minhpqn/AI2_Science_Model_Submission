This makes alkaline Earth metals with their two valence electrons less reactive than alkali metals with their one valence electron.
Examples of Alkaline Earth Metals
For a better understanding of alkaline Earth metals, let’s take a closer look at two of them: calcium (Ca) and strontium (Sr).
Calcium is a soft, gray, nontoxic alkaline Earth metal.
Although pure calcium doesn’t exist in nature, calcium compounds are very common in Earth’s crust and in sea water.
Calcium is also the most abundant metal in the human body, occurring as calcium compounds such as calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate.
These calcium compounds are found in bones and make them hard and strong.
The skeleton of the average adult contains about a kilogram of calcium.
Because calcium—like barium—absorbs x-rays, bones show up white in x-ray images.
Calcium is an important component of a healthy human diet.
Good food sources of calcium are pictured in Figure below .

Q:
What health problems might result from a diet low in calcium?
A:
Children who don’t get enough calcium while their bones are forming may develop a deficiency disease called rickets, in which their bones are softer than normal and become bent and stunted.
Adults who don’t get enough calcium may develop a condition called osteoporosis, in which the bones lose calcium and become weak and brittle.
People with osteoporosis are at high risk of bone fractures.
Strontium is a silver-colored alkaline Earth metal that is even softer than calcium.
Strontium compounds are quite common and have a variety of uses—from fireworks to cement to toothpaste.
