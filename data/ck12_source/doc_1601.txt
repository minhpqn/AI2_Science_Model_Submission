These will be discussed in additional concepts.
Organelles of a eukaryotic cell
Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and various other special compartments surrounded by membranes, called organelles.
The nucleus is where the DNA (chromatin) is stored.
Organelles give eukaryotic cells more functions than prokaryotic cells.
Prokaryotic cells ( Figure below ) are usually smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells.
They do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles.
In prokaryotic cells, the DNA, or genetic material, forms a single large circle that coils up on itself.
The DNA is located in the main part of the cell.

Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus.
Instead, their genetic material is located in the main part of the cell.

All cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and DNA.
Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound structures.
Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound structures called organelles.
