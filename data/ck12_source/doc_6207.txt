Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage of having haploid cells or diploid cells.
If a plant has a haploid chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome number?
If the diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number?
Plants alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants.
This is called alternation of generations , because the plant type alternates from generation to generation.
In alternation of generations, the plant alternates between a sporophyte that has diploid cells and a gametophyte that has haploid cells.
Alternation of generations can be summarized in the following four steps: follow along in the Figure below as you read through the steps.
The haploid gametophyte produces the gametes, or sperm and egg, by mitosis.
Remember, gametes are haploid, having one set of chromosomes.
Then, the sperm fertilizes the egg, producing a diploid zygote that develops into the sporophyte, which of course, is diploid.
The diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis.
The haploid spores go through mitosis, developing into the haploid gametophyte.
As we will see in additional Plants concepts, the generation in which the plant spends most of its life cycle is different between various plants.
In the plants that first evolved, the gametophyte takes up the majority of the life cycle of the plant.
During the course of evolution, the sporophyte became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant.
Alternation of generations on ferns
In ferns, the sporophyte is dominant and produces spores that germinate into a heart-shaped gametophyte.
Plants undergo alternation of generations, meaning they alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants.
During the course of evolution, the sporophyte (diploid) became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant.
