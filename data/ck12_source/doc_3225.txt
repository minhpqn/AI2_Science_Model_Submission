They transfer energy through matter or across space.
The transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves is called electromagnetic radiation.
The electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave are areas of electric or magnetic force.
The fields can exert force over objects at a distance.
An electromagnetic wave begins when an electrically charged particle vibrates.
This causes a vibrating electric field, which in turn creates a vibrating magnetic field.
The two vibrating fields together form an electromagnetic wave.
An electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave that can travel across space as well as through matter.
When it travels through space, it doesnâ€™t lose energy to a medium as a mechanical wave does.
When electromagnetic waves strike matter, they may be reflected, refracted, or diffracted.
Or they may be absorbed by matter and converted to other forms of energy.
The most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth is the sun.
Many other sources of electromagnetic waves depend on technology.
