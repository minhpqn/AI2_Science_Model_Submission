given: 613 mmHg
1 atm = 760 mmHg
101.3 kPa = 760 mmHg
pressure = ? atm
pressure = ? kPa
Use conversion factors from the equivalent pressure units to convert from mmHg to atm and from mmHg to kPa.
Step 2:
Solve.
613 \ \text{mmHg}\times\frac{1\ \text{atm}}{760 \ \text{mmHg}} &=0.807 \ \text{atm}\\613 \ \text{mmHg}\times\frac{101.3 \ \text{kPa}}{760 \ \text{mmHg}} &=81.7 \ \text{kPa}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The air pressure is about 80% that of standard atmospheric pressure at sea level.
For significant figure purposes, the standard pressure of 760 mmHg has three significant figures.
