What does not occur between meiosis I and meiosis II?
Why is this significant?
How many chromosomes are in the cells at the end of meiosis I and meiosis II?
Meiosis at  .
What is meiosis?
Compare the events of metaphase I to metaphase II?
Create a diagram to show how crossing-over occurs and how it creates new gene combinations on each chromosome.
Explain why sexual reproduction results in genetically unique offspring.
Explain how meiosis I differs from mitosis.
Compare and contrast spermatogenesis and oogenesis.
Explain the importance of a polar body.
What's the biggest cell on Earth?
The ostrich egg - unfertilized, of course.
Yes, this egg, just like a human ovum, is just one cell.
The egg shell membrane encloses the nucleus containing the genetic material and the cytoplasm.
At the end of meiosis, four haploid cells have been produced, but the cells are not yet gametes.
The cells need to develop before they become mature gametes capable of fertilization.
The development of haploid cells into gametes is called gametogenesis .
How much DNA is in a gamete?
The sperm cell forms by meiosis and spermatogenesis.
