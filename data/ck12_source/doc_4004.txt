How do viruses differ from living things?
How are they similar to living things?
Briefly describe how viruses depend on host cells.
What two characteristics of life are evident in viruses?
What is a phage?
Describe the structure of viruses.
Describe viral capsids.
Describe helical and icosahedral viruses.
Summarize characteristics of complex and enveloped viruses.
Is this a cell or a virus?
It is actually a representation of the HIV virus, the virus that causes AIDS.
All the little “knobs” on the outside of the virus help to give the virus structure.
And it is this structure that must be identified by a vaccine.
Structure of Viruses
Viruses vary in their structure.
A virus particle consists of DNA or RNA within a protective protein coat called a capsid.
The shape of the capsid may vary from one type of virus to another.
The capsid is made from the proteins that are encoded by viral genes within their genome.
The shape of the capsid serves as one basis for classification of viruses.
The capsid of the virus shown in Figure below is icosahedral.
