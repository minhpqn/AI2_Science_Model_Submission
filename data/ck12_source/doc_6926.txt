If you want the power dissipated (i.e. released) by a light bulb, then you multiply the voltage drop across the light bulb by the current going through that light bulb.
Power is the rate that energy is released.
The units for power are Watts (W) , which equal Joules per second [W] = [J]/[s] .
Therefore, a 60\;\mathrm{W} light bulb releases 60 Joules of energy every second.

A small flash light uses a single AA battery which provides a voltage of 1.5 V.
If the bulb has a resistance of 2\;\Omega , how much power is dissipated by the light bulb.
Since the light bulb is the only object in the circuit, we know the voltage drop across the light bulb is equal to that of the battery.
Therefore, we can use Ohm's law to solve for the current in the resistor.
Now we can determine the power of the bulb.

A light bulb with resistance of 80\ \Omega is connected to a 9\;\mathrm{V} battery.
What is the electric current going through it?
What is the power (i.e. wattage) dissipated in this light bulb with the 9\;\mathrm{V} battery?
How many electrons leave the battery every hour?
How many Joules of energy leave the battery every hour?
A bird is standing on an electric transmission line carrying 3000\;\mathrm{A} of current.
A wire like this has about 3.0 \times 10^{-5}\ \Omega of resistance per meter.
