How are these CYP genes important in individualized medicine ?
These genes, like all genes, have multiple alleles.
As these enzymes are involved in drug metabolism, different alleles can have different effectiveness at that metabolism.
For example, the CYP1A1 gene has 13 known alleles, known as CYP1A1*1, CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2B, CYP1A1*3, CYP1A1*4 and so on.
CYP1A1*1 is the wild type allele, and the others are usually due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).
The CYP2D6 gene has over 100 known alleles.
CYP2D6*1A is the wild type allele and the others are variations on the 1A sequence.
Some have a single SNP change, while other alleles have multiple base changes.
There are six separate CYP2D6*1 alleles within this gene family.
If a person receives one *1 allele each from his/her mother and his/her father to code for the CYP2D6 gene, then that person is considered to have an extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype.
An extensive metabolizer is considered the normal phenotype with average enzyme activity levels.
Other CYP metabolism phenotypes include: intermediate, ultra-rapid, and poor.
These phenotypes are due to allelic variation among the CYP genes.
However, with myriad possibilities of allelic combinations, this developing individualized medicine guidelines is still well under development.
CYP2D6 Allele and Enzyme Activity
We know that, thanks to our genome, each of us is phenotypically unique.
Some of those differences are obvious, like eye and hair color, but others are not obvious at all, such as how our bodies react to medication.
As discussed above, the CYP450 alleles have plenty to do with how each of us react to drugs.
