You are given the following three devices and a power supply of exactly 120\;\mathrm{v} . ^* Device X is rated at 60\;\mathrm{V} and  0.5\;\mathrm{A} ^* Device Y is rated at 15\;\mathrm{w} and 0.5\;\mathrm{A} ^* Device Z is rated at 120\;\mathrm{V} and 1800\;\mathrm{w} Design a circuit that obeys the following rules: you may only use the power supply given, one sample of each device, and an extra, single resistor of any value (you choose).
Also, each device must be run at their rated values.
