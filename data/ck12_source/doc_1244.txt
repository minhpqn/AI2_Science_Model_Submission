This type of magnetometer was one of their important tools.
Some important evidence for continental drift came after Wegener's death.
The following is the magnetic evidence:
Earth's magnetic field surrounds the planet from pole to pole.
If you have ever been hiking or camping, you may have used a compass to help you find your way.
A compass points to the magnetic North Pole.
The compass needle aligns with Earth’s magnetic field.
Some rocks contain little compasses too!
As lava cools, tiny iron-rich crystals line up with Earth’s magnetic field.
These crystals are magnetite crystals.
Anywhere lavas have cooled, these magnetite crystals point to the magnetic poles.
The little magnets point to where the North Pole was when the lava cooled.
A magnetometer is a device capable of measuring the magnetic field.
A magnetometer can be used on land.
A magnetometer also can be dragged behind a ship.
Evidence for Continental Drift
Geologists used magnetometers to look at rocks on land.
They wanted to know which direction magnetite crystals pointed.
This would tell them where magnetic north was at the time the rocks cooled.
This is what they learned:
