How are they different?
A:
A property that is shared by bases and acids is the ability to conduct electricity when dissolved in water.
Some ways bases and acids are different is that acids taste sour whereas bases taste bitter.
Also, acids but not bases react with metals.
For other differences between bases and acids, as well as why they differ in these ways, read the short article at this URL:
Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when bases come into contact with them, so they can be used to detect bases.
An example of an indicator is a compound called litmus.
It is placed on small strips of paper that may be red or blue.
If you place a few drops of a base on a strip of red litmus paper, the paper will turn blue.
You can see this in the Figure below .
Litmus isnâ€™t the only detector of bases.
Red cabbage juice can also detect bases, as you can see in this video:  .

Strength of Bases
The strength of bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14.
On this scale, a pH value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and a pH value greater than 7 indicates a basic solution.
