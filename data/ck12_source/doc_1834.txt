These sediments are bumped and pushed along the stream bed as bed load.
Bed load sediments do not move continuously.
This intermittent movement is called saltation .
Streams with high velocities that flow down steep slopes cut down into the stream bed.
The sediments that travel as bed load do a lot of the downcutting.
An animation of saltation is found here:

Deposition by Streams and Rivers
When a stream or river slows down, it starts dropping its sediments.
Larger sediments are dropped in steep areas, but smaller sediments can still be carried.
Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes less steep.
In arid regions, a mountain stream may flow onto flatter land.
The stream comes to a stop rapidly.
The deposits form an alluvial fan ( Figure below ).

Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water.
In this case, a delta forms.
A delta is shaped like a triangle.
It spreads out into the body of water.
