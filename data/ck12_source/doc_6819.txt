Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies.
Two examples are described below.
The Portuguese Man o' War ( Figure below ) looks like a single organism but is actually a colony of polyps.
One polyp is filled with air to help the colony float, while several feeding polyps hang below with tentacles.
The tentacles are full of nematocysts.
The Portuguese Man o' War is known to cause extremely painful stings to swimmers and surfers who accidentally brush up against it in the water.
A Portuguese Man o' War is a cnidarian colony
The Portuguese Man o' War can deliver nasty stings with its tentacles.
Coral reefs ( Figure below ) look like big rocks, but they are actually alive.
They are built from cnidarians called corals.
The corals are sessile (non-moving) polyps that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures that pass by.
Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate, which is also known as limestone.
Over long periods of time, their skeletons build on each other to produce large structures known as coral reefs.
Coral reefs are important habitats for many different types of ocean life.
Corals are colonial cnidarians.
Cnidarians have radial symmetry and true tissues.
Some cnidarians form colonies, such as corals.
