A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid .
As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases.
Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is.
Did you ever taste vinegar?
Like other acids, it tastes sour.
Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms.
For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus.
Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass.
If a solution has a lower concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH higher than 7.
A solution with a pH higher than 7 is called a base .
Bases, such as baking soda, have a bitter taste.
Like strong acids, strong bases can harm organisms and damage materials.
For example, lye can burn the skin, and bleach can remove the color from clothing.
Acids and Bases in Organisms
Acids and bases are important in living things because most enzymes can do their job only at a certain level of acidity.
Cells secrete acids and bases to maintain the proper pH for enzymes to work.
For example, every time you digest food, acids and bases are at work in your digestive system.
Consider the acidic environment of the stomach.
The acidic environment helps with the digestion of food.
The enzyme pepsin, which helps break down proteins in the stomach can only function optimally in the low pH environment.
