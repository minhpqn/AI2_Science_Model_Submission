Many seeds have additional structures that help them disperse.
Some examples are shown in Figure below .
Structures may help them travel in the wind or stick to animals.
Dispersal of seeds away from parent plants helps reduce competition with the parents and increases the chance of offspring surviving.
Seed adaptations: dandelion, maple, burdock
Dandelion seeds have tiny “parachutes.” Maple seeds have “wings” that act like little gliders.
Burdock seeds are covered with tiny hooks that cling to animal fur.
Classification of Seed Plants
The two major types of seed plants are the gymnosperms (seeds in cones) and angiosperms (seeds in ovaries of flowers).
Figure below shows how the seeds of gymnosperms and angiosperms differ.
Do you see the main difference between the two seeds?
The angiosperm seed is surrounded by an ovary .
Contrast between gymnosperm and angiosperm seed development
In gymnosperms, a seed develops on the scale of a cone.
Only an angiosperm seed develops inside an ovary.
There are only about 1,000 living species of gymnosperms, whereas there are hundreds of thousands of living species of angiosperms.
Living gymnosperms are typically classified in the divisions described in the Table below .
Most modern gymnosperms are trees with woody trunks.
The majority are conifers such as pine trees.
