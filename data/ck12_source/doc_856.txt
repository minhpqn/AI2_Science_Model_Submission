The Carbon Cycle
Describe the key features of the carbon cycle.
Describe the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
Define fossil fuels.
Explain the role of fossil fuels in global climate change.
Why is Earth getting warmer?
What happens if carbon is not removed from the atmosphere?
The excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming.
Where does this carbon dioxide come from?
Burning gas to power our cars and burning coal to generate electricity are two main sources of the excess carbon dioxide.
The Carbon Cycle
Carbon is one of the most common elements found in living organisms.
Chains of carbon molecules form the backbones of many organic molecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.
Carbon is constantly cycling between living organisms and the atmosphere ( Figure below ).
The cycling of carbon occurs through the carbon cycle
Living organisms cannot make their own carbon, so how is carbon incorporated into living organisms?
In the atmosphere, carbon is in the form of carbon dioxide gas (CO 2 ).
Recall that plants and other producers capture the carbon dioxide and convert it to glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) through the process of photosynthesis .
Then as animals eat plants or other animals, they gain the carbon from those organisms.
The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 .
