Colonial algae of the genus Volvox .
Colonial organisms were probably one of the first evolutionary steps towards multicellular organisms.
Algae of the genus Volvox are an example of the border between colonial organisms and multicellular organisms.
Each Volvox , shown in Figure above , is a colonial organism.
It is made up of between 1,000 to 3,000 photosynthetic algae that are grouped together into a hollow sphere.
The sphere has a distinct front and back end.
The cells have eyespots, which are more developed in the cells near the front.
This enables the colony to swim towards light.
Origin of Multicellularity
The oldest known multicellular organism is a red algae Bangiomorpha pubescens , fossils of which were found in 1.2 billion-year-old rock.
As the first organisms were single-celled, these organisms had to evolve into multicellular organisms.
Scientists think that multicellularity arose from cooperation between many organisms of the same species.
The Colonial Theory proposes that this cooperation led to the development of a multicellular organism.
Many examples of cooperation between organisms in nature have been observed.
For example, a certain species of amoeba (a single-celled protist) groups together during times of food shortage and forms a colony that moves as one to a new location.
Some of these amoebas then become slightly differentiated from each other.
Volvox , shown in Figure above , is another example of a colonial organism.
Most scientists accept that the Colonial Theory explains how multicellular organisms evolved.
Multicellular organisms are organisms that are made up of more than one type of cell and have specialized cells that are grouped together to carry out specialized functions.
Most life that you can see without a microscope is multicellular.
