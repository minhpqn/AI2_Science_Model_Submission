All invertebrates can move on their own during at least some stage of their life cycle.
However, they may differ in how they move.
Several ways are described below.
Some invertebrates are simply carried along by water currents.
They cannot control their movement in a particular direction.
An example is a jellyfish.
Other invertebrates can contract muscles to move independently of water currents or on solid surfaces.
They can also control the direction in which they move.
An example is a roundworm.
It can move forward and to the left or right.
Still other invertebrates have specialized appendages for movement.
For example, they may have jointed legs for walking or climbing or wings for flying.
An example is an insect such as a fly.
Most invertebrates have a nervous system .
The nervous system allows them to sense and respond to their environment.
The simplest invertebrate nervous system is just a network of nerves that can sense touch, called a nerve net (see Figure below ).
Most invertebrates have a more complex nervous system.
It may include a brain and several different sense organs.
