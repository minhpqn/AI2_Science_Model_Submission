During the late Precambrian, continents drifted, carbon dioxide levels fluctuated, and climates changed.
Many organisms could not survive the changes and died out.
Other organisms evolved important new adaptations.
These include sexual reproduction, cell specialization, and multicellularity.
The Precambrian ended with a mass extinction, which paved the way for the Cambrian explosion.
