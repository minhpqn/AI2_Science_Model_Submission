Gastropods use their foot to crawl slowly over rocks, reefs, or soil, looking for food.
Bivalves are generally sessile filter feeders.
They live in both freshwater and marine habitats.
They use their foot to attach themselves to rocks or reefs or to burrow into mud.
Bivalves feed on plankton and nonliving organic matter.
They filter the food out of the water as it flows through their mantle cavity.
Cephalopods are carnivores that live only in marine habitats.
They may be found in the open ocean or close to shore.
They are either predators or scavengers.
They generally eat other invertebrates and fish.

Dwarf Cuttlefish
What's the coolest critter in the ocean under 4 inches long?
The Dwarf Cuttlefish!
Cuttlefish are marine animals that belong to the class Cephalopoda.
Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but mollusks.
Recent studies indicate that cuttlefish are among the most intelligent invertebrates, with one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.
Cuttlefish have an internal shell called the cuttlebone and eight arms and two tentacles furnished with suckers, with which they secure their prey.
