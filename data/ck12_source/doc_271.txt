A 6.00 kg ball, A , moving at velocity 3.00 m/s due east collides with a 6.00 kg ball, B , at rest.
After the collision, A moves off at 40.0째 N of E and ball  B moves off at 50.0째 S of E.
Vectors of two balls after a collision
What is the momentum of  A after the collision?
What is the momentum of  B after the collision?
What are the velocities of the two balls after the collision?
Solution: p_{\text{initial}} = mv = (6.00 \ \text{kg})(3.00 \ \text{m/s}) = 18.0 \ \text{kg m/s}
This is a right triangle in which the initial momentum is the length of the hypotenuse and the two momenta after the collision are the legs of the triangle.
p_A = (18.0 \ \text{kg m/s})(\cos 40.0^\circ) = (18.0 \ \text{kg m/s})(0.766) = 13.8 \ \text{kg m/s}
p_B = (18.0 \ \text{kg m/s})(\cos 50.0^\circ) = (18.0 \ \text{kg m/s})(0.643) = 11.6 \ \text{kg m/s}
v_A = 2.30 \ \text{m/s} \qquad v_B = 1.93 \ \text{m/s}
The conservation of momentum law holds for all closed systems regardless of the directions of the objects before and after they collide.
Momentum is a vector; collisions in two dimensions can be represented by axial vector components.
This video shows circus performers using conservation of momentum.

Why do the fliers scrunch up in the air while spinning and twisting?
What happens to the rate at which they spin when they change shape in the air?
Billiard ball A , mass 0.17 kg, moving due east with a velocity of 4.0 m/s, strikes stationary billiard ball B , also mass of 0.17 kg.  After the collision, ball  A moves off at an angle of 30째 north of east with a velocity of 3.5 m/s, and  ball  B  moves off at an angle of 60 째 south of east .
