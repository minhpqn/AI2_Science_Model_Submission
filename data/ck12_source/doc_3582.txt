Describe the structure of a mitochondrion.
Because we're hungry.
Not necessarily.
But biologically speaking…we eat to get energy.
The food we eat is broken down, the glucose extracted, and that energy is converted into ATP.
What happens to the energy stored in glucose during photosynthesis?
How do living things make use of this stored energy?
The answer is cellular respiration .
This process releases the energy in glucose to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule that powers all the work of cells.

Stages of Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions.
The reactions can be summed up in this equation:
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Chemical Energy (in ATP)
The reactions of cellular respiration can be grouped into three stages: glycolysis (stage 1), the Krebs cycle , also called the citric acid cycle (stage 2), and electron transport (stage 3).
Figure below gives an overview of these three stages, which are further discussed in the concepts that follow.
Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of the cell and does not require oxygen, whereas the Krebs cycle and electron transport occur in the mitochondria and do require oxygen.

Cellular respiration takes place in the stages shown here.
