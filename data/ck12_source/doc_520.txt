These insects tend to transfer protozoan or viral parasites.
When an insect bites an infected person or animal, it picks up the pathogen.
Then the pathogen travels to the next person or animal it bites.
Ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.
Mosquitoes ( Figure below ) carry West Nile virus.
Both pathogens cause fever, headache, and tiredness.
If the diseases are not treated, more serious symptoms may develop.
Other diseases spread by mosquitoes include Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever.

Some diseases are spread by insects.
The type of mosquito shown here can spread West Nile virus.
The virus doesnâ€™t make the mosquito sick.
The mosquito just carries the virus from one person or animal to another.
The mosquito is a vector.
The first case of West Nile virus in North America occurred in 1999.
Within just a few years, the virus had spread throughout most of the United States.
Birds as well as humans can be infected with the virus.
Birds often fly long distances.
This is one reason why West Nile virus spread so quickly.
Infectious diseases are caused by bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or viruses that can travel from one person to another.
