P(A) &= 30\% \ \text{or} \ 0.30\\P(B) &= 25\% \ \text{or} \ 0.25\\ P(A \ \text{and} \ B) &= P(A) \times P(B)\\P(A \ \text{and} \ B) &= 0.30 \times 0.25\\P(A \ \text{and} \ B) &= 0.075 In other words, 7.5% of the students of ABC high school are both on the honor roll and have a part-time job.
In Example 1, 2 coins are tossed one after the other.
Remember that event A consists of the outcomes when getting heads on the first toss, and event B consists of the outcomes when getting heads on the second toss.
What would be the probability of tossing the coins and getting a head on both the first coin and the second coin?
We know that the probability of getting a head on a coin toss is \frac{1}{2}, or 50%.
In other words, we have a 50% chance of getting a head on a toss of a fair coin and a 50% chance of getting a tail.
P(A) &= 50\% \ \text{or} \ 0.50\\P(B) &= 50\% \ \text{or} \ 0.50\\\\P(A \ \text{and} \ B) &= P(A) \times P(B)\\P(A \ \text{and} \ B) &= 0.50 \times 0.50\\P(A \ \text{and} \ B) &= 0.25 Therefore, there is a 25% chance of getting 2 heads when tossing 2 fair coins.
Example 4 2 cards are chosen from a deck of cards.
The first card is replaced before choosing the second card.
What is the probability that they both will be sevens?
Solution:
Let A = 1^{\text{st}} seven chosen.
Let B = 2^{\text{nd}} seven chosen.
A little note about a deck of cards A deck of cards consists of 52 cards.
Each deck has 4 parts (suits) with 13 cards in them.
Each suit has 3 face cards. & 4 \ \text{suits} \qquad 1 \ \text{seven} \ \text{per suit}\\& \ \searrow \qquad \swarrow\\\text{The total number of sevens in the deck} &= 4 \times 1=4.
Since the card was replaced, these events are independent:
P(A) &= \frac{4}{52}\\\\& \qquad \qquad \ \ \text{Note:
The total number of cards is}\\P(B) &= \frac{4}{52} \ \swarrow \ \text{52 after choosing the first card,}\\& \qquad \qquad \ \ \text{because the first card is replaced.}\\\\P(A \ \text{and} \ B) &= \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{4}{52} \ \text{or} \ P(A \cap B)=\frac{4}{52} \times \frac{4}{52}\\\\P(A \cap B) &= \frac{16}{2704}\\\\P(A \cap B) &= \frac{1}{169} Example 5 The following table represents data collected from a grade 12 class in DEF High School.
