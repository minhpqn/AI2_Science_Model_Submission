Renewable resources may also be so abundant that running out is impossible.
The difference between non-renewable and renewable resources is like the difference between ordinary batteries and rechargeable ones.
If a flashlight with ordinary batteries goes dead, the batteries need to be replaced.
But if the flashlight has rechargeable batteries, the batteries can be placed in a charger.
The charger transfers energy from an outlet into the batteries.
Once recharged, the batteries can be put back into the flashlight.
Rechargeable batteries can be used again and again ( Figure below ).
In this way, the energy in the rechargeable batteries is renewable.
Rechargeable batteries are a source of renewable energies
Rechargeable batteries are renewable because they can be refilled with energy.
Is the energy they are refilled with always renewable?
Types of Non-Renewable Resources
Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas.
Fossil fuels are the greatest energy source for modern society.
Millions of years ago, plants used energy from the Sun to form carbon compounds.
These compounds were later transformed into coal, oil, or natural gas.
Fossil fuels take millions of years to form.
For this reason, they are non-renewable.
We will use most fossil fuels up in a matter of decades.
Burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of pollution.
