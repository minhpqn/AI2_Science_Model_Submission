In general, the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base.
Likewise, the weaker the acid, the stronger its conjugate base.
Relative Strengths of Acids and their Conjugate Bases
HCl (hydrochloric acid) (strongest)
Cl − (chloride ion) (weakest)
H 2 SO 4 (sulfuric acid)
HSO 4 − (hydrogen sulfate ion)
HNO 3 (nitric acid)
NO 3 − (nitrate ion)
H 3 PO 4 (phosphoric acid)
H 2 PO 4 − (dihydrogen phosphate ion)
CH 3 COOH (acetic acid)
CH 3 COO − (acetate ion)
H 2 CO 3 (carbonic acid)
HCO 3 − (hydrogen carbonate ion)
HCN (hydrocyanic acid) (weakest)
CN − (cyanide ion) (strongest)
Strong acids are 100% ionized in solution.
Weak acids are only slightly ionized.
Phosphoric acid is stronger than acetic acid and so is ionized to a greater extent.
