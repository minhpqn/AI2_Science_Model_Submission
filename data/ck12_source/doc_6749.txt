A truck with mass 500 kg and originally carrying 200 kg of dirt is rolling forward with the transmission in neutral and shooting out the dirt backwards at 2 m/s (so that the dirt is at relative speed of zero compared with the ground).
If the truck is originally moving at 2 m/s, how fast will it be moving after it has shot out all the dirt.
You may ignore the effects of friction.
To solve this problem we will apply conservation of momentum to the truck when it is full of dirt and when it has dumped all the dirt.
m_iv_i&=m_fv_f && \text{start by setting the initial momentum equal to the final momentum}\\(m_t+m_d)v_i&=m_tv_f && \text{substitute the mass of the truck plus the mass of the dirt in the truck at the initial and final states}\\v_f&=\frac{(m_t+m_d)v_i}{m_t} && \text{solve for the final velocity}\\v_f&=\frac{(500\;\text{kg} + 200\;\text{kg})*2\;\text{m/s}}{500\;\text{kg}} && \text{plug in the numerical values}\\v_f&=2.8\;\text{m/s}\\
John and Bob are standing at rest in middle of a frozen lake so there is no friction between their feet and the ice.
Both of them want to get to shore so they simultaneously push off each other in opposite directions.
If John's mass is 50 kg and Bob's mass is 40 kg and John moving at 5 m/s after pushing off Bob, how fast is Bob moving?
For this problem, we will apply conservation of momentum to the whole system that includes both John and Bob.
Since both of them are at rest to start, we know that the total momentum of the whole system must always be zero.
Therefore, we know that the sum of John's and Bob's momentum after they push off each other is also zero.
We can use this to solve for Bob's velocity.
The answer is negative because Bob is traveling in the opposite direction to John.
