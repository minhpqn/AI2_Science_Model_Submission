Living things need organic molecules to store genetic information and to carry out the chemical work of cells.
Modern organisms use DNA to store genetic information and proteins to catalyze chemical reactions.
So, did DNA or proteins evolve first?
This is like asking whether the chicken or the egg came first.
DNA encodes proteins and proteins are needed to make DNA, so each type of organic molecule needs the other for its own existence.
How could either of these two molecules have evolved before the other?
Did some other organic molecule evolve first, instead of DNA or proteins?
RNA World Hypothesis
Some scientists speculate that RNA may have been the first organic molecule to evolve.
In fact, they think that early life was based solely on RNA and that DNA and proteins evolved later.
This is called the RNA world hypothesis.
Why RNA?
It can encode genetic instructions (like DNA), and some RNAs can carry out chemical reactions (like proteins).
Therefore, it solves the chicken-and-egg problem of which of these two molecules came first.
Other evidence also suggests that RNA may be the most ancient of the organic molecules.

The first organic molecules formed about 4 billion years ago.
This may have happened when lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earthâ€™s early atmosphere.
RNA may have been the first organic molecule to form as well as the basis of early life.
