A person untrained in the sciences may only observe, "The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying, while chimps on the other side of the jungle are healthy." A scientist, however, will make more detailed observations.
Can you think of ways to make this observation more detailed?
What about the number of chimps?
Are they male or female?
Young or old?
What do they eat?
A good scientist may observe, "While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior, four female and five male chimps under the age of five on the south side have died." Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design their experiments and answer their questions.
From these observations, a scientist will develop a hypothesis to explain the observations.
A hypothesis is the scientist's proposed explanation for his observations.
The scientist's hypothesis may be that "Young chimps on the south side die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet."
An adult and infant chimapanzee
An adult and infant chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ).
Scientists find answers using tests :
When scientists want to answer a question, they search for evidence using experiments.
An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong.
Evidence is made up of the observations a scientist makes during an experiment.
To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees, scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts, berries, and vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food.
This test is the experiment.
If fewer chimps die, then the experiment shows that the chimps may have died from not having enough food.
This is the evidence.
