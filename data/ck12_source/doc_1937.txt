Evidence for the existence of Pangaea was what Alfred Wegener used to create his continental drift hypothesis.
Continental drift is described in the chapter Plate Tectonics .
As the continents move, the shape of the oceans changes too.
At the time of Pangaea, most of Earthâ€™s water was collected in a huge ocean.
This ocean was called Panthalassa ( Figure below ).
The breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea
Pangaea was the sole landform 250 million years ago.
The rest of the planet was a huge ocean called Panthalassa, along with a few smaller seas.
The Paleozoic began with the supercontinent Rodinia.
The era ended with the supercontinent Pangaea.
As continents come together, orogenies build up mountain ranges.
Pangaea was a giant landmass made of all of the continents around 250 million years ago.
