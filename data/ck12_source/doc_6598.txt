Other side chains are polar, while some are acidic or basic.
Structure of five biologically relevant amino acids
Five of the twenty biologically relevant amino acids, each having a distinctive side chain (R).
Alanine’s side chain is nonpolar, while threonine’s is polar.
Tryptophan is one of several amino acids whose side chain is aromatic.
Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain, while lysine has a basic side chain.
The Table below lists the names of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids along with a three-letter abbreviation which is used to describe sequences of linked amino acids.
