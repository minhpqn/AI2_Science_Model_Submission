Assuming no heat loss to the surroundings, what is the final temperature of the mixture?
The specific heat of methanol is 2450 J/kg•ºC.
A 100.0 g brass block at 100.0ºC is placed in 200.0 g of water at 20.0ºC.
The specific heat of brass is 376 J/kg•ºC.
Assuming no heat loss to the surroundings, what is the final temperature of the mixture?
calorimeter:
A device used to measure the heat flow of a chemical reaction or physical change.
calorimetry:
A way to measure the energy change of a reaction or the energy contained in matter.
Change of State
Define heat of fusion.
Define heat of vaporization.
Calculate heat transfers necessary for changes of state.
Steam traction engine depended on water changing from a liquid to gaseous state
Before the internal combustion engine was invented, steam engines were the power source for ships, locomotives, tractors, lumber saws, and most industrial machines.
Coal or wood was burned to boil water into steam, which ran the engine.
Change of State
Most substances may exist in any of the three common states of matter.
In the gaseous state, the molecular motion has completely overcome any attraction between the particles and the particles are totally separate from each other.
There are large spaces between the particles and they move large distances between collisions.
