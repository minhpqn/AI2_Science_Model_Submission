They named the phenomenon apparent polar wander .
The apparent North Pole for Europe and North America merge if the continents drift
On the left:
The apparent North Pole for Europe and North America if the continents were always in their current locations.
The two paths merge into one if the continents are allowed to drift.
Geologists were now more interested in continental drift.
More than ever, they needed a mechanism.
Magnetite is a magnetic mineral found in lava.
The magnetite points to the magnetic north pole when it cools.
Scientists used magnetometers to show where the north magnetic pole had been when magnetite crystals cooled.
Magnetite crystals of different ages and on different continents pointed to different spots.
The simplest explanation is that the continents have moved.
Apparent polar wander is another line of evidence for drifting continents.
