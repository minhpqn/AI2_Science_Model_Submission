A nebula is the birthplace of stars.
Our sun was probably born in a nebula around 5 billion years ago.
Within a nebula, there are varying regions where gravity has caused the gas and dust to clump together.
The gravitational attraction of these clumps pull more atoms into the clump.
As this  accretion continues, the gas pressure increases and the core of the protostar gets hotter and hotter.
If the protostar gets dense enough and hot enough, a fusion reaction will ignite and the star lights up.
The minimum mass for the formation of a star is about 80 times the mass of Jupiter.
A star is a very large, very hot ball of gas which has hydrogen fusing into helium in the core.
Stars spend the majority of their life fusing hydrogen into helium.
When the hydrogen is nearly used up, the star can fuse helium into heavier elements.
Throughout this process, a battle goes on in the core of the star between gravity trying to collapse the star and temperature-produced gas pressure pushing the material in the star outward.
During the life of a star, there is a balance between the gas pressure pushing out and gravity pushing in.
Once a star has achieved nuclear fusion in its core, it radiates energy into space.
While the temperature-produced gas pressure balances gravity, the star attains a stable state and enters the main sequence phase of its life.
The temperature of a main sequence star is about 15,000,000Â°C.
For the major part of its life span, a star stays in this main sequence phase, with hydrogen being fused into helium and a balance between force pushing out and force pushing in.
How long a star lives depends on its initial size.
Stars can live from many millions of years to many billions of years.
The most massive stars (many times the size of our sun) become extremely dense and hot in the core and therefore, have a very high fusion rate.
The largest stars use up their hydrogen fuel fastest and therefore live for the shortest time, perhaps only millions of years.
