Control of Viruses
People have been able to control the spread of viruses even before they knew they existed.
In 1717, Mary Montagu, the wife of an English ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, observed local women inoculating their children against smallpox, a contagious viral disease that was often deadly.
Inoculation involves introducing a small amount of virus into a personâ€™s body to allow their body to build up immunity to the virus.
This early smallpox inoculation involved putting smallpox crusts into the nostril of a healthy person.
Because viruses use the machinery of a host cell to reproduce and stay within them, they are difficult to get rid of without killing the host cell.
Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of viruses.
A vaccine is a mixture of antigenic material and other immune stimulants that will produce immunity to a certain pathogen or disease.
