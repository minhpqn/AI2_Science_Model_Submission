When \Delta H is positive and \Delta S is negative, the sign of \Delta G will always be positive, and the reaction can never be spontaneous.
This corresponds to both driving forces working against product formation.
When one driving force favors the reaction, but the other does not, it is the temperature that determines the sign of \Delta G .
Consider first an endothermic reaction (positive \Delta H ) that also displays an increase in entropy (positive \Delta S ).
It is the entropy term that favors the reaction.
Therefore, as the temperature increases, the T \Delta S term in the Gibbs free energy equation will begin to predominate and \Delta G will become negative.
A common example of a process which falls into this category is the melting of ice.
At a relatively low temperature (below 273 K), the melting is not spontaneous because the positive \Delta H term “outweighs” the T \Delta S term.
When the temperature rises above 273 K, the process becomes spontaneous because the larger T value has tipped the sign of \Delta G over to being negative.
When the reaction is exothermic (negative \Delta H ) but undergoes a decrease in entropy (negative \Delta S ), it is the enthalpy term that favors the reaction.
In this case, a spontaneous reaction is dependent upon the T \Delta S term being small relative to the \Delta H term, so that \Delta G is negative.
The freezing of water is an example of this type of process.
It is spontaneous only at a relatively low temperature.
Above 273 K, the larger T \Delta S value causes the sign of \Delta G to be positive, and freezing does not occur.
Free energy is defined.
Relationships between enthalpy, entropy, and free energy are described.
