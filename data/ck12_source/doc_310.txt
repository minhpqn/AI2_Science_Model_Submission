Solution:
The heat lost by the block of zinc will equal the heat gain by the water in the calorimeter.
In order to set heat gain mathematically equal to heat loss, either one of the terms must be made negative or the temperature change must be reversed.
You should also note that the final temperature of the water and the block of zinc will be the same when equilibrium is reached.
m_Wc_W(t_2 - t_1)_W &= m_{Zn}c_{Zn}(t_1 - t_2)_{Zn} \\(0.500 \ \text{kg})(4180 \ \text{J/kg}^\circ \text{C})(x - 15.0^\circ \text{C}) &= (0.0400 \ \text{kg})(388 \ \text{J/kg}^\circ \text{C})(115.0^\circ \text{C} - x) \\2090 \ x - 31350 &= 1785 - 15.52 \ x \\2105.52 \ x &= 33135 \\x &= 15.7^\circ \text{C}
Example Problem:  A 100. g block of aluminum at 100.0ºC is placed in g of water at 10.0ºC.
The final temperature of the mixture is 25.0ºC.
What is the specific heat of the aluminum as determined by the experiment?
Solution: m_Wc_W(t_2 - t_1)_W &= m_{Al}c_{Al}(t_1 - t_2)_{Al} \\(0.100 \ kg)(4180 \ J/kg^\circ \text{C})(25.0^\circ \text{C} - 10.0^\circ \text{C}) &= (0.100 \ \text{kg})(x)(100.0^\circ \text{C} - 25.0^\circ \text{C}) \\6270 &= 7.50 \ x \\x &= 836 \ \text{J/kg}^\circ \text{C}
A calorimeter is a device used to measure changes in thermal energy or heat transfer.
If a reaction is carried out in the reaction vessel or if a measured mass of heated substance is placed in the water of the calorimeter, the change in the water temperature allows us to calculate the change in thermal energy.
