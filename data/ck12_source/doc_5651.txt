The gluons carry the strong nuclear force between quarks, binding them together.
This force is needed to overcome the electric force of repulsion between positive protons.
Although protons were discovered almost 100 years ago, the quarks and gluons inside them were discovered much more recently.
Scientists are still learning more about these fundamental particles.

Image of quarks in a proton
A proton one of three main particles that make up the atom.
It is found in the nucleus.
It has an electrical charge of one +1 and a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu).
Atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements.
Protons consist of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.
Gluons carry the strong nuclear force between quarks, binding them together.

What is the relationship between protons and elements?
Atoms, which are always neutral in electric charge, contain electrons as well as protons and neutrons.
An electron has an electrical charge of -1.
If an atom has three electrons, infer how many protons it has.
Identify the fundamental particles that make up a proton.
Explain how isotopes of an element differ from one another.
Identify fundamental particles in neutrons.
