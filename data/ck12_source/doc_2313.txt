Scientists tackled and solved the problem of determining the chemical structure of the anti-cancer drug so it could be synthesized in labs.
This is a win-win solution to the problem.
The synthetic drug is now available to save lives, and the trees are no longer endangered by being stripped of their bark.
Ethical Rules in Science
Ethics is an important consideration in science.
Scientific investigations must be guided by what is right and what is wrong.
Thatâ€™s where ethical rules come in.
They help ensure that science is done safely and that scientific knowledge is reliable.
Here are some of the ethical rules that scientists must follow:
Scientific research must be reported honestly.
It is wrong and misleading to make up or change research results.
Scientific researchers must try to see things as they really are.
They should avoid being biased by the results they expect or hope to get.
Researchers must be careful.
They should do whatever they can to avoid errors in their data.
Researchers must inform coworkers and members of the community about any risks of their research.
They should do the research only if they have the consent of these groups.
Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely.
They should provide for their needs and take pains to avoid harming them.
Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects that they have the right to refuse to participate in the research.
