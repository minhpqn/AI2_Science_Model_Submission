The oxygen atom has a total of eight valence electrons, so its outer energy level is full.
A full outer energy level is the most stable possible arrangement of electrons.
It explains why elements form chemical bonds with each other.
Types of Chemical Bonds
Not all chemical bonds form in the same way as the bonds in water.
There are actually three different types of chemical bonds, called covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds.
Each type of bond is described below.
You can learn more about the three types by watching this video:

For an entertaining song comparing covalent and ionic bonds, go to this URL:
A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two nonmetal atoms that share a pair of electrons.
One electron is provided by each atom, and the pair of electrons is attracted to the positive nuclei of both atoms.
The water molecule represented in the Figure above contains covalent bonds.
An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together oppositely charged ions.
Ionic bonds form crystals instead of molecules.
Table salt contains ionic bonds.
A metallic bond is the force of attraction between a positive metal ion and the valence electrons that surround itâ€”both its own valence electrons and those of other ions of the same metal.
The ions and electrons form a lattice-like structure.
Only metals, such as the copper pictured in the Figure below , form metallic bonds.
