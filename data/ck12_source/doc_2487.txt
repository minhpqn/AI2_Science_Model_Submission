It was first proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s.
Amontons’ gas law is just one of three commonly known gas laws.
The other two are Boyle’s law and Charles’ law.
Q:
How does Amontons' gas law explain the difference in air pressure in Lawrence’s tire?
A:
The tire—and the air inside it—got warmer because of friction with the road.
The volume of air inside the tire was more-or-less constant, so the pressure of the air increased when it got warmer.
Why does the pressure of a gas increase as it gets warmer?
Particles of a gas are constantly moving and bumping into things.
The force of the collisions is measured by pressure.
Pressure is the amount of force exerted on a given area, such as pounds of force per square inch.
When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster.
This causes more collisions and greater pressure.
Therefore, heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase.

Look at the graph in the simulation above as you change the temperature of the gas.
What happens to the pressure of the gas as its temperature increases?
