How Many Cylinders?
Most cars have at least four cylinders connected to the crankshaft.
Their pistons move up and down in sequence, one after the other.
A powerful car may have eight pistons, and some racecars may have even more.
The more cylinders a car engine has, the more powerful its engine can be.
A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work.
An internal combustion engine burns fuel internally, or inside the engine.
In an internal combustion engine, a mixture of fuel and air is burned in a closed cylinder, forcing a piston to move up and down.
In a car, the moving piston rotates a crankshaft, which turns a driveshaft.
The turning driveshaft causes the wheels of the car to turn.
