Explain how different types of active transport occur.
Compare endocytosis and exocytosis.
What does a cell "eat"?
Is it possible for objects larger than a small molecule to be engulfed by a cell?
Of course it is.
This image depicts a cancer cell being attacked by a cell of the immune system.
Cells of the immune system consistently destroy pathogens by essentially "eating" them.
Just as cells can bring substances into the cell, they can also export substances out of the cell.
Vesicles and Active Transport
Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass through the plasma membrane or to move through a transport protein.
So cells use two other active transport methods to move these macromolecules (large molecules) into or out of the cell.
Vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm move macromolecules or large particles across the plasma membrane.
There are two types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and exocytosis.
These processes are active transport mechanisms, therefore energy is required.
Endocytosis and Exocytosis
Endocytosis is the process of capturing a substance or particle from outside the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane.
The membrane folds over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the membrane.
At this point a membrane-bound sac, or vesicle pinches off and moves the substance into the cytosol.
There are two main kinds of endocytosis:
Phagocytosis or "cellular eating," occurs when the dissolved materials enter the cell.
