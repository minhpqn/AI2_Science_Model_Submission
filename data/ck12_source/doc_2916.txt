Sometimes an individual has a phenotype between the two parents because one allele is not dominant over another.
This pattern of inheritance is called incomplete dominance .
For example, snapdragon flowers show incomplete dominance.
One of the genes for flower color in snapdragons has two alleles, one for red flowers and one for white flowers.
A plant that is homozygous for the red allele ( RR ) will have red flowers, while a plant that is homozygous for the white allele will have white flowers ( WW ).
But the heterozygote will have pink flowers ( RW ) ( Figure below ) as both alleles are expressed.
Neither the red nor the white allele is dominant, so the phenotype of the offspring is a blend of the two parents.
Pink snapdragons are an example of incomplete dominance
Pink snapdragons are an example of incomplete dominance.
Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly.
This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels.
A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin.
A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells.
What type of blood cells do you think a person who is heterozygous ( Ss ) for the trait will have?
They will have some misshapen cells and some normal cells ( Figure below ).
Both the dominant and recessive alleles are expressed, so the result is a phenotype that is a combination of the recessive and dominant traits.

Sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become misshapen and curved unlike normal, rounded red blood cells.
Another exception to Mendel's laws is a phenomenon called codominance .
For example, our blood type shows codominance.
