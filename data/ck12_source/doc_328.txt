Your body replaces damaged or missing skin cells by growing more of them.
Did you know that the layer of skin you can see is actually dead?
As the dead cells are shed or removed from the upper layer, they are replaced by the skin cells below them.
Two different layers make up the skin: the epidermis and the dermis ( Figure below ).
A fatty layer lies under the dermis, but it is not part of your skin.
Illustration of the layers of skin
Skin is made up of two layers, the epidermis on top and the dermis below.
The tissue below the dermis is called the hypodermis, but it is not part of the skin.
The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin.
It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body's surface.
Although the top layer of epidermis is only about as thick as a sheet of paper, it is made up of 25 to 30 layers of cells.
The epidermis also contains cells that produce melanin.
Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin and hair their color.
Melanin-producing cells are found in the bottom layer of the epidermis.
The epidermis does not have any blood vessels.
The lower part of the epidermis receives blood by diffusion from blood vessels of the dermis.
The dermis is the layer of skin directly under the epidermis.
It is made of a tough connective tissue.
The dermis contains hair follicles, sweat glands, oil glands, and blood vessels ( Figure above ).
It also holds many nerve endings that give you your sense of touch, pressure, heat, and pain.
