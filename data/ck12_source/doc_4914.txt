This process is called exocytosis.
In addition to the Golgi apparatus and ER, vesicles can also fuse with other organelles within the cell.
Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in Figure below .
Because a vesicle is essentially a small organelle, the space inside the vesicle can be chemically different from the cytosol.
It is within the vesicles that the cell can perform various metabolic activities, as well as transport and store molecules.
Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in this figure.
Types of Vesicles
Vesicles can be classified by their contents and function.
Transport vesicles are part of the endomembrane system.
They are able to move molecules such as proteins between locations inside the cell.
For example, transport vesicles move proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
Lysosomes are vesicles that are formed by the Golgi apparatus.
They contain powerful enzymes that could break down (digest) the cell.
Lysosomes break down harmful cell products, waste materials, and cellular debris and then force them out of the cell.
They also digest invading organisms such as bacteria.
Lysosomes also break down cells that are ready to die, a process called autolysis.
Peroxisomes are vesicles that use oxygen to break down toxic substances in the cell.
Unlike lysosomes, which are formed by the Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes self-replicate by growing bigger and then dividing.
They are common in liver and kidney cells that break down harmful substances.
Peroxisomes are named for the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) that is produced when they break down organic compounds.
