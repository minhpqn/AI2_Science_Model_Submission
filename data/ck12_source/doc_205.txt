Newton’s First and Second Laws of Motion
State the fundamental units for the Newton.
State Newton's First Law of Motion.
Given two of the three values in F = ma , calculate the third.
Astronauts weigh less on the moon than on Earth because the force of gravity is weaker on the moon
This image is of Buzz Aldrin, one of the first men to walk on the moon.
Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first humans, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the moon on July 20, 1969.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface 6 hours later on July As you probably already know, men weigh less on the moon than on Earth; this is because the force of gravity is less on the moon than on Earth.
Newton’s First and Second Laws of Motion
A force is a push or a pull on an object.
When you place a book on a table, the book pushes downward on the table and the table pushes upward on the book.
The two forces are equal and there is no resulting motion of the book.
If, on the other hand, you hold the book in the air and let go, the force of gravity will pull the book to the ground.
If you slide a book across the floor or a table, the book will experience a frictional force, which acts in the opposite direction of the motion.
This force will slow down the motion of the book and eventually bring it to rest.
A smoother surface has a smaller force of friction, which will allow the book to slide further before coming to rest.
If a perfectly smooth floor could be created, there would be no friction and the book would slide forever at constant speed.
Newton’s First Law of Motion states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion.
It describes a phenomenon called inertia .
Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist change in its state of motion.
