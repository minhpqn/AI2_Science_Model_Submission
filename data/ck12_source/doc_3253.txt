The light they emit is visible light.
The Light We See
Visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human eye can detect.
It allows us to see objects in the world around us.
Without visible light, we would only be able to sense most objects by sound, touch, or smell.
Like humans, most other organisms also depend on visible light, either directly or indirectly.
Many animals—including predators of jellyfish—use visible light to see.
Plants and certain other organisms use visible light to make food in the process of photosynthesis.
Without this food, most other organisms would not be able to survive.
Q:
Do you think that some animals might be able to see light that isn’t visible to humans?
A:
Some animals can see light in the infrared or ultraviolet range of wavelengths.
For example, mosquitoes can see infrared light, which is emitted by warm objects.
By seeing infrared light, mosquitoes can tell where the warmest, blood-rich areas of the body are located.
Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun.
The sun and other stars produce light because they are so hot.
They glow with light due to their extremely high temperatures.
This way of producing light is called incandescence .
Incandescent light bulbs also produce light in this way.
