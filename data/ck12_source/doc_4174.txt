Explain the roles of xylem and phloem.
What is this abstract pattern?
Is it just a random artistic piece?
Is it a depiction of a pattern of bubbles?
Would you believe it is part of a plant?
It is actually the center portion of a carrot taproot.
And these are all cells.
Cells that have come together to form a tissue, with a specific function.
What do you think is the main function of tissue in a plant's root?
As for all animals, your body is made of four types of tissue: epidermal, muscle, nerve, and connective tissues.
Plants, too, are built of tissues, but not surprisingly, their very different lifestyles derive from different kinds of tissues.
All three types of plant cells are found in most plant tissues.
Three major types of plant tissues are dermal, ground, and vascular tissues.
Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis .
You can think of the epidermis as the plantâ€™s skin.
It mediates most of the interactions between a plant and its environment.
Epidermal cells secrete a waxy substance called cuticle , which coats, waterproofs, and protects the above-ground parts of plants.
Cuticle helps prevent water loss, abrasions, infections, and damage from toxins.
This tissue includes several types of specialized cells.
Pavement cells, large, irregularly shaped parenchymal cells which lack chloroplasts, make up the majority of the epidermis.
