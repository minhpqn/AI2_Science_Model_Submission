There are many other important physical science theories.
Here are three more examples:
Einstein’s theory of gravity
Kinetic theory of matter
Wave-particle theory of light
Keep It Simple
The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony.
The word parsimony means “thriftiness.” The law of parsimony states that, when choosing between competing theories, you should select the theory that makes the fewest assumptions.
In other words, the simpler theory is more likely to be correct.
For example, you probably know that Earth and the other planets of our solar system orbit around the sun.
But several centuries ago, it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around Earth.
While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according to this theory, the explanation is unnecessarily complex.
Q:
Why do you think parsimony is an important characteristic of scientific theories?
A:
The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific theory, the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect.
If one assumption is wrong, so is the theory.
Conversely, the theory that makes the fewest assumptions, assuming it is well supported by evidence, is most likely to be correct.
A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence.
Examples of theories in physical science include Dalton’s atomic theory, Einstein’s theory of gravity, and the kinetic theory of matter.
