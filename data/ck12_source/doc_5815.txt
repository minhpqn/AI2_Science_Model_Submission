But they were wrong.
Now, scientists know that fungi are not plants at all.
Fungi are very different from plants.
The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy.
Plants are autotrophs , meaning that they make their own "food" using the energy from sunlight.
Fungi are heterotrophs , which means that they obtain their "food" from outside of themselves.
In other words, they must "eat" their food like animals do.
But they don't really eat.
Instead, they absorb their nutrients.
Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are all different kinds of fungi.
There may be as many as 1.5 million species of fungi ( Figure below ).
You can easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope, but most fungi you cannot see.
Fungi are either too small to be seen without a microscope, or they live where you cannot see them easily—deep in the soil, under decaying logs, or inside plants or animals.
Some fungi even live in, or on top of, other fungi.

Fungi are Good Eaters
Fungi can grow fast because they are such good eaters.
Fungi have lots of surface area, and this large surface area “eats” or absorbs.
Surface area is how much exposed area an organism has, compared to their overall volume.
