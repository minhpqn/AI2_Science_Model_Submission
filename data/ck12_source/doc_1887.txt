The best fossils would probably be ones that you could get DNA from.
DNA holds the genes of an organisms.
The genes could tell scientists a lot about what the organisms was really like.
Where could you find a fossil with DNA?
How about a melting glacier?
You might be able to find a creature that had been frozen into the ice for a long time.
A frozen animal would be very well preserved!
How Fossils Form
The process by which remains or traces of living things become fossils is called fossilization ( Figure below ).
Most fossils are preserved in sedimentary rocks.
Fossils in Sedimentary Rock
Most fossils form when a dead organism is buried in sediment.
Layers of sediment slowly build up.
The sediment is buried and turns into sedimentary rock.
The remains inside the rock also turn to rock.
The remains are replaced by minerals.
The remains literally turn to stone.
This type of fossilization is called permineralization .
