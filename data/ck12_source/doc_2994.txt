Einstein did not believe in God because of his scientific theories.
How did Newton describe gravity?

Why is Einstein’s theory of gravity widely accepted today?
Acceleration Due to Gravity
Describe the acceleration of falling objects due to gravity.
Explain why falling objects with different masses accelerate at the same rate.
It’s a good thing this mountain climber’s safety gear is working, because it’s a long way down to the ground!
If he were to fall, he’d be moving really fast by the time he got there.
The higher any object starts falling from above Earth’s surface, the faster it’s traveling by the time it reaches the ground.
Do you know why?
The reason is gravity.
Speeding up While Falling Down
Gravity is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground.
When objects fall to the ground, gravity causes them to accelerate.
Acceleration is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion.
Gravity causes an object to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the object falls.
In fact, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s 2 , so by 1 second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s.
By 2 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s), and so on.
The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is illustrated in the Figure below .
