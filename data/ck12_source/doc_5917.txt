How would we write the configuration for xenon tetrafluoride using the ABE system?
electron domain geometry:
Geometry based only on the number of electron pairs around the central atom, both bonding pairs and lone pairs.
Use electronegativity values to determine bond type.
Sharing ideas is like bond polarity
What makes people share?
Have you ever spent time with someone you really didnâ€™t like?
You had nothing in common with them and did not want to have anything to do with them.
On the other hand, there are people you enjoy being with.
You have a lot in common and like to share with them.
Atoms work the same way.
If there are strong differences in their attraction of electrons, one atoms gets the electrons and the other atom loses them.
If they are similar, they share the electrons to form a covalent bond.
Electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom to attract electrons when the atoms are in a compound.  Electronegativities of elements are shown in the periodic table below.
Electronegativity values of elements in the periodic table
Electronegativities of elements.
The degree to which a given bond is ionic or covalent is determined by calculating the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved in the bond.
As an example, consider the bond that occurs between an atom of potassium and an atom of fluorine.  Using the table, the difference in electronegativity is equal to 4.0 - 0.8 = 3.2.  Since the difference in electronegativity is relatively large, the bond between the two atoms is ionic.  Since the fluorine atom has a much larger attraction for electrons than the potassium atom does, the valence electron from the potassium atom is completely transferred to the fluorine atom.
The diagram below shows how difference in electronegativity relates to the ionic or covalent character of a chemical bond.
