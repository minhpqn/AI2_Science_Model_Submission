Economically, there are many direct benefits of biodiversity.
As many as 40,000 species of fungi, plants, and animals provide us with many varied types of clothing, shelter, medicines and other products.
These include poisons, timber, fibers, fragrances, papers, silks, dyes, adhesives, rubber, resins, skins, furs, and more.
According to one survey, 57% of the most important prescription drugs come from nature.
Specifically, they come from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals ( Figure below ).
But only a small amount of species with the ability to give us medicines have been explored.
The loss of any species may mean the loss of new medicines, which will have a direct effect on human health.
Aspirin is a medicine derived originally from nature
Aspirin originally came from the bark of the white willow tree, pictured here.
Biodiversity and Technology
Nature has inspired many technologies in use today.
Bionics , also known as biomimetics or biomimicry, uses organisms to inspire technology or engineering projects.
By studying animals and their traits, we are able to gain valuable information that we can put to use to help us.
For example, rattlesnake heat-sensing pits helped inspire the development of infrared sensors.
Zimbabweâ€™s Eastgate Centre ( Figure below ) was inspired by the air-conditioning efficiency of a termite mound ( Figure below ).
Nature has also helped to inspire designs such as the Eastgate Centre
Design of the Eastgate Centre (brown building), in Zimbabwe, which requires just 10% of the energy needed for a conventional building of the same size, was inspired by a biological design.

Biodiversity also has many benefits to ecosystems.
