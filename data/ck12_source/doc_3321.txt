State Ohm’s law.
An electric appliance is connected by wires to a 240-volt source of voltage.
If the combined resistance of the appliance and wires is 12 ohms, how much current is flowing through the circuit?
Define electric circuit.
Describe the parts of an electric circuit.
Show how to represent a simple electric circuit with a circuit diagram.
Jose made this sketch of a battery and light bulb for science class.
If this were a real set up, the light bulb wouldn’t work.
The problem is the loose wire on the left.
It must be connected to the positive terminal of the battery in order for the bulb to light up.
Q:
Why does the light bulb need to be connected to both battery terminals?
A:
Electric current can flow through a wire only if it forms a closed loop.
Charges must have an unbroken path to follow between the positively and negatively charged parts of the voltage source, in this case, the battery.
