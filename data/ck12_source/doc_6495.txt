Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride
It may be logical to assume that the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, called brine , would yield the same result through the same reactions as the process in molten NaCl.
However, the reduction reaction that occurs at the cathode does not produce sodium metal because the water is reduced instead.
This is because the reduction potential for water is only -0.83 V compared to -2.71 V for the reduction of sodium ions.
This makes the reduction of water preferable because its reduction potential is less negative.
Chlorine gas is still produced at the anode, just as in the electrolysis of molten NaCl.
& \text{oxidation (anode):} && 2\text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(g) + 2e^- && E^0 = -1.36 \text{ V} \\& \text{reduction (cathode):} && 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2(g) + 2\text{OH}^- && E^0 = -0.83 \text{ V} \\\hline& \text{overall reaction:} && 2\text{Cl}^-(aq) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(g) + \text{H}_2(g) + 2\text{OH}^-(aq) && E^0{_\text{cell}} = -2.19 \text{ V}
Since hydroxide ions are also a product of the net reaction, the important chemical sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is obtained from evaporation of the aqueous solution at the end of the hydrolysis.
