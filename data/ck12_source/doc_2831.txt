All radioactive decay is dangerous to living things, but alpha decay is the least dangerous.
At the following URL, read the article and watch the video about alpha decay.
Then answer the questions below.
When were alpha particles discovered, and who discovered them?
Write the nuclear equation for the alpha decay of seaborgium-263.
What element is produced in this nuclear reaction?
How many neutrons does it have?
Explain how to use the periodic table to identify the element produced when a given radioactive element undergoes alpha decay.
What are alpha emitters?
Give some examples.
What is alpha decay?
Explain why alpha decay occurs.
If a radioactive element with 85 protons undergoes alpha decay, how many protons will there be in the new element that forms as the product of the reaction?
What element is it?
