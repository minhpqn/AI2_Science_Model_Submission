Therefore, most do not grow exponentially.
Certainly, no population can keep growing exponentially for very long.
Many factors may limit growth.
Often, the factors are density dependent (known as density-dependent factors ).
These are factors that are influential when the population becomes too large and crowded.
For example, the population may start to run out of food or be poisoned by its own wastes.
As a result, population growth slows and population size levels off.
Curve B in Figure above represents this pattern of growth, which is called logistic growth .
At what population size does growth start to slow in the logistic model of growth?
That depends on the populationâ€™s carrying capacity (see Figure above ).
The carrying capacity (K) is the largest population size that can be supported in an area without harming the environment.
Population growth hits a ceiling at that size in the logistic growth model.
K -Selected and r -Selected Species
Species can be divided into two basic types when it comes to how their populations grow.
Species that live in stable environments are likely to be K -selected .
Their population growth is controlled by density-dependent factors.
Population size is generally at or near the carrying capacity.
These species are represented by curve B in Figure above .
Species that live in unstable environments are likely to be r -selected .
Their potential population growth is rapid.
