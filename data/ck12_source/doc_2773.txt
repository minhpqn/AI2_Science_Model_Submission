A tremendous amount of photosynthesis takes place in the plants of this lush tropical rainforest.
The green streaks on this very blue lake are photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria.
The green “scum” on this pond consists of photosynthetic algae.
Photosynthesis is the process in which certain living things use energy in sunlight to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water.
Oxygen is also produced in this process.
Chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules is used by the cells of almost all living things for energy.
Living things that undergo photosynthesis and produce glucose include plants, cyanobacteria, and algae.
