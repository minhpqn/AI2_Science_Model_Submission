It can be represented by the equation:
Work = Force × Distance
This equation shows that the greater the force that is used to move an object or the farther the object is moved, the more work that is done.
You can see a short video introduction to work as the product of force and distance at this link:

To see the effects of force and distance on work, compare the weight lifters in the Figure below .
The two weight lifters on the left are lifting the same amount of weight, but the one on the bottom is lifting the weight a greater distance.
Therefore, this weight lifter is doing more work.
The two weight lifters on the bottom right are both lifting the weight the same distance, but the weight lifter on the left is lifting a heavier weight, so she is doing more work.
Examples illustrating how force and distance affect the amount of work done
In physics, work is defined as the use of force to move an object.
For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction that the object moves.
Work is directly related to both the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves.
It can be represented by the equation:
Work = Force × Distance.
