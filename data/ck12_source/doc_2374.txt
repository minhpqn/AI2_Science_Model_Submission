Q:
The volume of the blue rectangular solid above is 150 cm 3 .
If it has a mass of 300 g, what is its density?
A:
The density of the rectangular solid is:
\text{Density} = \dfrac{300 \ \text{g}}{150 \ \text{cm}^3}= 2 \ \text{g/cm}^3
Q:
Suppose you have two boxes that are the same size but one box is full of feathers and the other box is full of books.
Which box has greater density?
A:
Both boxes have the same volume because they are the same size.
However, the books have greater mass than the feathers.
Therefore, the box of books has greater density.
Units of Derived Quantities
A given derived quantity, such as area, is always expressed in the same type of units.
For example, area is always expressed in squared units, such as cm 2 or m 2 .
If you calculate area and your answer isnâ€™t in squared units, then you have made an error.
Q:
What units are used to express volume?
