UV radiation splits the ozone molecule ( Figure below ).
The split creates an oxygen molecule (O 2 ) and an oxygen atom (O).
This split releases heat that warms the stratosphere.
By absorbing UV radiation, ozone also protects Earth’s surface.
UV radiation would harm living things without the ozone layer.

How does the ozone layer protect Earth’s surface from UV light?
At the top of the stratosphere is a thin layer called the stratopause.
It acts as a boundary between the stratosphere and the mesosphere.
There is little mixing between the troposphere and the stratosphere.
Ozone gas protects life on Earth from harmful UV light.
The ozone layer is in the stratosphere.
It has a higher concentration of ozone than the rest of the atmosphere.
