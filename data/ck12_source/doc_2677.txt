Both hydrogen and oxygen gases exist as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules.
These molecules are the reactants in the reaction.
The Figure below shows that bonds must break to separate the atoms in the hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
Then new bonds must form between hydrogen and oxygen atoms to form water molecules.
The water molecules are the products of the reaction.

A:
The reactants are hydrogen (H 2 ) and fluorine (F 2 ), and the product is hydrogen fluoride (HF).
All chemical reactions involve both reactants and products.
Reactants are substances that start a chemical reaction, and products are substances that are produced in the reaction.
A chemical reaction can be represented by the general chemical formula: \text{Reactants} \rightarrow \text{Products} .
Bonds break and reform during chemical reactions.
Reactants and products contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction, so reactants and products are different substances.
Do the activities at the following URL for practice with reactants and products.
