Example Problem:
What force is required to accelerate a 2000. kg car at 2.000 m/s 2 ?
Solution:
F = ma = (2000. \ \text{kg})(2.000 \ \text{m/s}^2) = 4000. \ \text{N}
Example Problem:
A net force of 150 N is exerted on a rock.
The rock has an acceleration of 20. m/s 2 due to this force.
What is the mass of the rock?
Solution: m = \frac{F}{a} = \frac{(150 \ \text{N})}{(20. \ \text{m/s}^2)} = 7.5 \ \text{kg}
Example Problem:
A net force of 100.
N is exerted on a ball.
If the ball has a mass of 0.72 kg, what acceleration will it undergo?
Solution: a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{(100. \ \text{N})}{(0.72 \ \text{kg})} = 140 \ \text{m/s}^2
A force is a push or pull on an object.
Newton’s First Law states that an object with no net force acting on it remains at rest or moves with constant velocity in a straight line.
Newton’s Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
Newton’s Second Law is expressed as an equation, F = ma .
