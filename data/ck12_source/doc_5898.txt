Democritus believed atoms were held together by hooks
What holds molecules together?
In one form or another, the idea of atoms connecting to form larger substances has been with us for a long time.  The Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 BC) believed that atoms had hooks on them that allowed atoms to connect with one another.  Today we believe that atoms are held together by bonds formed when two atoms share a set of electrons, a much more complicated picture than the simple hooks that Democritus preferred.
