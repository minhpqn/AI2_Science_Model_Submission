However, there are other ways to detect it.
You generally canâ€™t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation.
Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation.
A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation.
When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current.
The current causes the Geiger counter to click.
The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.
You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.

Despite its dangers, radioactivity has several uses.
For example, it can be used to determine the ages of ancient rocks and fossils.
It can also be used as a source of power to generate electricity.
Radioactivity can even be used to diagnose and treat diseases, including cancer.
Cancer cells grow rapidly and take up a lot of glucose for energy.
Glucose containing radioactive elements can be given to patients.
Cancer cells take up more of the glucose than normal cells do and give off radiation.
The radiation can be detected with special machines like the one in the Figure below .
The radiation may also kill cancer cells.
