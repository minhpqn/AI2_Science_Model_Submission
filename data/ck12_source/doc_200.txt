What does the area under the curve of the line represent?
An airplane accelerates with a constant rate of 3.0 m/s 2 starting at a velocity of 21 m/s.  If the distance traveled during this acceleration was 535 m, what is the final velocity?
An car is brought to rest in a distance of 484 m using a constant acceleration of -8.0 m/s 2 .  What was the velocity of the car when the acceleration first began?
An airplane starts from rest and accelerates at a constant 3.00 m/s 2 for 20.0 s.  What is its displacement in this time?
A driver brings a car to a full stop in 2.0 s.
If the car was initially traveling at 22 m/s, what was the acceleration?
How far did the car travel during braking?
Acceleration Due to Gravity
Describe the acceleration of falling objects due to gravity.
Explain why falling objects with different masses accelerate at the same rate.
It’s a good thing this mountain climber’s safety gear is working, because it’s a long way down to the ground!
If he were to fall, he’d be moving really fast by the time he got there.
The higher any object starts falling from above Earth’s surface, the faster it’s traveling by the time it reaches the ground.
Do you know why?
The reason is gravity.
Speeding up While Falling Down
Gravity is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground.
When objects fall to the ground, gravity causes them to accelerate.
Acceleration is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion.
Gravity causes an object to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the object falls.
