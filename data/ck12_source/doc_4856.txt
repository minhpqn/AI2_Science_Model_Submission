The Cell Theory - Advanced
Summarize the principle points of the Cell Theory.
Where do cells come from?
All cells come from other cells.
It was the advent of the microscope that allowed this discovery to be made.
And it is one of the three basic points of the Cell Theory.
This picture represents cell division, the process of one cell dividing into two cells.
The Cell Theory
Over the next two centuries after the discoveries of Hooke and Leeuwenhoek, biologists found cells everywhere.
Biologists in the early part of the 19 th century suggested that all living things were made of cells , but the role of cells as the primary building block of life was not discovered until 1839 when two German scientists, Theodor Schwann, a zoologist , and Matthias Jakob Schleiden, a botanist , suggested that cells were the basic unit of structure and function of all living things.
Later, in 1858, the German doctor Rudolf Virchow observed that cells divide to produce more cells.
He proposed that all cells arise only from other cells.
The collective observations of all three scientists form the Cell Theory , which states that:
all organisms are made up of one or more cells,
all the life functions of an organism occur within cells,
all cells come from preexisting cells.
