The darts are grouped together and have hit the bulls-eye.  This demonstrates high precision and high accuracy.  Scientists always strive to maximize both in their measurements.
Students in a lab using volumetric flasks
Students in a chemistry lab are making careful measurements with a series of volumetric flasks.
Accuracy and precision are critical in every experiment.
Accuracy is a measure of how close a measurement is to the correct or accepted value of the quantity being measured.
Precision is a measure of how close a series of measurements are to one another.

What can be said about the reproducibility of precise values?
accuracy:
A measure of how close a measurement is to the correct or accepted value of the quantity being measured
precision:
A measure of how close a series of measurements are to one another.
Precise measurements are highly reproducible, even if the measurements are not near the correct value.
Define accepted value.
Define experimental value.
Define error and calculate the error given appropriate data.
Define percent error and calculate the error given appropriate data.
Resistors have a percent error indicated by a colored band
How does an electrical circuit work?
A complicated piece of electronics equipment may contain several resistors whose role is to control the voltage and current in the electrical circuit.  Too much current and the apparatus malfunctions.
