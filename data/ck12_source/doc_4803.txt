Lipids and Diet
Humans need lipids for many vital functions such as storing energy and forming cell membranes.
Lipids can also supply cells with energy.
In fact, a gram of lipids supplies more than twice as much energy as a gram of carbohydrates or proteins.
Lipids are necessary in the diet for most of these functions.
Although the human body can manufacture most of the lipids it needs, there are others, called essential fatty acids , that must be consumed in food.
Essential fatty acids include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
Both of these fatty acids are needed for important biological processes, not just for energy.
Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful.
Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain.
A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood.
This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease.
The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol.
For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.
