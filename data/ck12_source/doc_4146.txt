Describe the earliest plants.
Explain the significance of plants moving onto land.
Describe plants' adaptations for life on land.
Explain the importance of a plant's vascular tissues.
Which moved onto land first, plants or animals?
This fossilized fern may be millions of years old.
Over 200 million years ago, the first evidence of ferns related to several modern families appeared.
The "great fern radiation" occurred in the late-Cretaceous, which ended 65 million years ago, when many modern families of ferns first appeared.
And if animals were the first on land, would many have starved?
Evolution of Plants
As shown in Figure below , plants are thought to have evolved from an aquatic green alga protist.
Later, they evolved important adaptations for land, including vascular tissues, seeds, and flowers.
Each of these major adaptations made plants better suited for life on dry land and much more successful.
Diagram of plant evolution
From a simple, green alga ancestor that lived in the water, plants eventually evolved several major adaptations for life on land.
The Earliest Plants
The earliest plants were probably similar to the stonewort , an aquatic algae pictured in Figure below .
Unlike most modern plants, stoneworts have stalks rather than stiff stems, and they have hair-like structures called rhizoids instead of roots.
On the other hand, stoneworts have distinct male and female reproductive structures, which is a plant characteristic.
For fertilization to occur, sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs.
