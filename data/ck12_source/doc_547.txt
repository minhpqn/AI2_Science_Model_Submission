Do they remind you of brushes?
Most body fluids that you release from your body contain chemicals that kill pathogens.
For example, mucus, sweat, tears, and saliva contain enzymes called lysozymes that kill pathogens.
These enzymes can break down the cell walls of bacteria to kill them.
The stomach also releases a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid.
This acid kills most pathogens that enter the stomach in food or water.
Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens can grow in it.
You are not aware of them, but your skin is covered by millions (or more!) of bacteria.
Millions more live inside your body.
Most of these bacteria help defend your body from pathogens.
How do they do it?
They compete with harmful bacteria for food and space.
This prevents the harmful bacteria from multiplying and making you sick.
Your bodyâ€™s first line of defense includes the skin and other barriers that keep pathogens out of your body.
