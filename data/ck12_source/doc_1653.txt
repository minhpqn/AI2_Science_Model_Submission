The chromosomes line up in the center, or the equator, of the cell.
The chromosomes line up in a row, one on top of the next.
Anaphase :
The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate as the spindles pull the chromatids apart, resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes.
Telophase :
The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in both cells.
An overview of the cell cycle and mitosis
An overview of the cell cycle and mitosis: during prophase the chromosomes condense, during metaphase the chromosomes line up, during anaphase the sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell, and during telophase the nuclear envelope forms.
After telophase, each new nucleus contains the exact same number and type of chromosomes as the original cell.
The cell is now ready for cytokinesis, which literally means "cell movement." During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm divides and the parent cell separates, producing two genetically identical cells, each with its own nucleus.
A new cell membrane forms and in plant cells, a cell wall forms as well.
Below is a representation of dividing plant cells ( Figure below
Drawing of dividing plant cells
This is a representation of dividing plant cells.
Cell division in plant cells differs slightly from animal cells as a cell wall must form.
Note that most of the cells are in interphase.
Can you find examples of the different stages of mitosis?
The DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes.
During mitosis, the newly duplicated chromosomes are divided into two daughter nuclei.
Mitosis occurs in four phases, called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
