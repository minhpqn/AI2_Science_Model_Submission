Named after the Roman goddess of love, Venus is the only planet named after a female.
Venus is sometimes called Earth’s “sister planet.” Venus is our nearest neighbor and is most like Earth in size.
But Venus is a lot different from Earth.
Earth's life would not find the planet very hospitable at all.
A Harsh Environment
Viewed through a telescope, Venus looks smooth and featureless.
The planet is covered by a thick layer of clouds.
You can see the clouds in pictures of Venus ( Figure below ).

Venus in real color.
The planet is covered by a thick layer of clouds.
We make maps of the surface using radar because the thick clouds won’t allow us to take photographs of the surface of Venus.
This is shown in the first image at the top.
Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor.
Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant.
They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid!
Scientists think the color of sunlight on Venus is reddish-brown.
The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high.
