Higher levels of organization allow animals to perform many complex functions.
What can animals do that most other living things cannot?
Most animals share these characteristics: sensory organs , movement , and internal digestion .
All of them are illustrated in Figure below .
Animals can detect environmental stimuli, such as light, sound, and touch.
Stimuli are detected by sensory nerve cells.
The information is transmitted and processed by the nervous system.
The nervous system, in turn, may direct the body to respond.
Animal Eyes at  has 26 images of the eyes of various animals.
All animals can move, at least during some stage of their life cycle.
Muscles and nerves work together to allow movement.
Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates.
It also helps them escape from predators.
Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food.
Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them. (Many other organisms absorb nutrients directly from the environment.)
Most animals share these characteristics: sensory organs, movement, and internal digestion.
Animal Life Cycle and Reproduction
Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle.
A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure below .
Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms.
