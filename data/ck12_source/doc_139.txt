Rodents include rats, mice, and other small gnawing mammals.
They have a single pair of continuously growing incisors (teeth) in each of the upper and lower jaws that must be kept short by gnawing.
Carnivores include cats and lions and tigers, dogs and wolves, polar bears, and other meat eaters.
Insectivores include moles and shrews ( Figure below ).
These mammals eat primarily insects, other arthropods, and earthworms.
A shrew is an insectivore
One of the subgroups of mammals is the insectivores, including this shrew.
Bats include the vampire bat.
These mammals have forelimbs that form webbed wings, making bats the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight.
Primates include monkeys, apes and humans.
These mammals are characterized by detailed development of the hands and feet, a shortened snout, and a large brain.
Ungulates include hoofed animals, such as deer, sheep, goats, pigs, buffalo, elephants and giraffes ( Figure below ).
These mammals use their hoofs to sustain their whole body weight while moving.
Hoofs are formed by a thick nail rolled around the tip of the toe.
A giraffe is an ungulate, hoofed animals
The ungulates (hoofed animals), like the giraffe here, is one of the subgroups of mammals.
Mammals can also be grouped according to the adaptations they form to live in a certain habitat.
For example, terrestrial mammals with leaping kinds of movement, as in some marsupials and lagomorphs, typically live in open habitats.
Other terrestrial mammals are adapted for running, such as dogs or horses.
Still others, such as elephants, hippopotamuses, and rhinoceroses, move slowly.
