Brønsted-Lowry Acid-Base Reactions
An acid-base reaction according to the Brønsted-Lowry definition is a transfer of a proton from one molecule or ion to another.
When ammonia is dissolved in water, it undergoes the following reversible reaction.
& \text{NH}_3(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{NH}_4^+(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq) \\& \text{base} \qquad \quad \ \ \text{acid} \quad \qquad \text{acid} \qquad \quad \ \ \text{base}
In this reaction, the water molecule is donating a proton to the ammonia molecule.
The resulting products are the ammonium ion and the hydroxide ion.
The water is acting as a Brønsted-Lowry acid, while the ammonia is acting as a Brønsted-Lowry base.
The hydroxide ion that is produced causes the solution to be basic.
We can also consider the reverse reaction in the above equation.
In that reaction, the ammonium ion donates a proton to the hydroxide ion.
The ammonium ion is a Brønsted-Lowry acid, while the hydroxide ion is a Brønsted-Lowry base.
Most Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions can be analyzed in this way.
There is one acid and one base as reactants, and one acid and one base as products.
In the above reaction, water acted as an acid, which may seem a bit unexpected.
Water can also act as a base in a Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction, as long as it reacts with a substance that is a better proton donor.
Shown below is the reaction of water with the hydrogen sulfate ion.
& \text{HSO}_4^-(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{H}_3\text{O}^+(aq)+\text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq) \\& \text{acid} \qquad \qquad \ \ \text{base} \ \ \qquad \text{acid} \qquad \quad \ \ \text{base}
So, water is capable of being either an acid or a base, a characteristic called amphoterism.
An amphoteric substance is one that is capable of acting as either an acid or a base by donating or accepting hydrogen ions.
