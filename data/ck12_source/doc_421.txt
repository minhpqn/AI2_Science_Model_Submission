Anemia is usually caused by one of the following:
A loss of blood from a bleeding wound or a slow leak of blood.
The destruction of red blood cells.
A lack of red blood cell production.
Anemia may not have any symptoms.
Some people with anemia feel weak or tired in general or during exercise.
They also may have poor concentration.
People with more severe anemia often get short of breath during times of activity.
Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia.
It occurs when the body does not receive enough iron.
Since there is not enough iron, hemoglobin, which needs iron to bind oxygen, cannot function properly.
In the United States, 20% of all women of childbearing age have iron-deficiency anemia, compared with only 2% of adult men.
The most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in young women is blood lost during menstruation.
Iron deficiency anemia can be avoided by getting the recommended amount of iron in one's diet.
Anemia is often treated or prevented by taking iron supplements.
Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day.
Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day.
Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day.
Pregnant women need the most ironâ€”27 mg daily.
Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters.
