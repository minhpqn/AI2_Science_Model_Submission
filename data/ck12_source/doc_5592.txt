Explain the difference between mass and weight.
An astronaut floating in space
How is he floating?
One of the many interesting things about travel in outer space is the idea of weightlessness.
If something is not fastened down, it will float in mid-air.
Early astronauts learned that weightlessness had bad effects on bone structure.
If there was no pressure on the legs, those bones would begin to lose mass.
Weight provided by gravity is needed to maintain healthy bones.
Specially designed equipment is now a part of every space mission so the astronauts can maintain good body fitness.
Mass and Weight
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter that an object contains.
The mass of an object is made in comparison to the standard mass of 1 kilogram.
The kilogram was originally defined as the mass of 1 L of liquid water at 4Â°C (volume of a liquid changes slightly with temperature).
In the laboratory, mass is measured with a balance ( Figure below ), which must be calibrated with a standard mass so that its measurements are accurate.
An analytical balance is used to precisely measure weight
An analytical balance makes very sensitive mass measurements in a laboratory, usually in grams.
Other common units of mass are the gram and the milligram.
A gram is 1/1000th of a kilogram, meaning that there are 1000 g in 1 kg.
A milligram is 1/1000th of a gram, so there are 1000 mg in 1 g.
Mass is often confused with the term weight.
