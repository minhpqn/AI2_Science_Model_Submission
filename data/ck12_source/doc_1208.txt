How do extrusive igneous rocks form?
What is another name for these rocks?
How can you use texture to determine whether an igneous rock is intrusive or extrusive?
Igneous Rock Classification
Explain how igneous rocks are classified by composition and by cooling rate.
Is this igneous rock intrusive or extrusive?
You can't really tell from this view.
A close up view would show small crystals in a dark colored rock.
This indicates rapid cooling from a basalt lava.
The most interesting feature you can see are the hexagonal "posts." For them to form, cooling must not have been too rapid.
This amazing feature is Devil's Tower in Wyoming.
Igneous Rock Classification
Igneous rocks are classified by composition and texture.
The composition can be felsic, intermediate, mafic, or ultramafic.
The composition depends on the minerals the rock includes.
A felsic rock will contain felsic minerals.
The mineral compositions are listed in the Table below .
The table includes examples of minerals.
Quartz, orthoclase feldspar
Plagioclase feldspar, biotite, amphibole
