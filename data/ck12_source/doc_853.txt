In a forest community, caterpillars eat leaves, and birds eat caterpillars.
Draw an energy pyramid using this information.
The Water Cycle
Define biogeochemical cycle.
Describe the key features of the water cycle.
Distinguish condensation from precipitation.
Distinguish evaporation from transpiration.
Could you be drinking the same water as George Washington?
Water is recycled constantly through the ecosystem.
That means any water you drank today has been around for millions of years.
You could be drinking water that was once drunk by George Washington, the first humans, or even the dinosaurs.
The Water Cycle
Whereas energy flows through an ecosystem, water and elements like carbon and nitrogen are recycled.
Water and nutrients are constantly being recycled through the environment.
This process through which water or a chemical element is continuously recycled in an ecosystem is called a biogeochemical cycle .
This recycling process involves both the living organisms (biotic components) and nonliving things (abiotic factors) in the ecosystem.
Through biogeochemical cycles, water and other chemical elements are constantly being passed through living organisms to non-living matter and back again, over and over.
Three important biogeochemical cycles are the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle .
The biogeochemical cycle that recycles water is the water cycle.
The water cycle involves a series of interconnected pathways involving both the biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere.
