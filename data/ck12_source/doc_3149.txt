From particle to particle, like dominoes falling, thermal energy moves through matter.

In the opening photo above, conduction occurs between particles of metal in the cookie sheet and anything cooler that comes into contact with it—hopefully, not someone’s bare hands!
For a deeper understanding of this method of heat transfer, watch the animation “Conduction” at this URL:
Examples of Conduction
The cookie sheet in the opening image transfers thermal energy to the cookies and helps them bake.
There are many other common examples of conduction.
The Figure below shows a few situations in which thermal energy is transferred in this way.
Other common examples of conduction
Hot Iron:
A hot iron removes the wrinkles in a shirt.
Hot Cocoa:
Holding a cup of hot cocoa feels good when you have cold hands.
Camp Stove:
This camp stove can be used to cook food in a small pot.
Snow:
Ouch!
Can you imagine how cold this snow must feel on bare feet?
Q:
How is thermal energy transferred in each of the situations pictured in the Figure above ?
