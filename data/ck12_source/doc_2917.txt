Do you know what your blood type is?
Are you A?
O?
AB?
Those letters actually represent alleles.
Unlike other traits, your blood type has three alleles, instead of two!
The ABO blood types ( Figure below ) are named for the protein attached to the outside of the blood cell.
In this case, two alleles are dominant and completely expressed (I A and I B ), while one allele is recessive (i).
The I A allele encodes for red blood cells with the A antigen, while the I B allele encodes for red blood cells with the B antigen.
The recessive allele (i) does not encode for any proteins.
Therefore a person with two recessive alleles (ii) has type O blood.
As no dominant (I A and I B ) allele is present, the person cannot have type A or type B blood.
What are the genotypes of a person with type A or type B blood?
An example of codominant inheritance is ABO blood types
An example of codominant inheritance is ABO blood types.
There are two possible genotypes for type A blood, homozygous ( I A I A ) and heterozygous ( I A i ), and two possible genotypes for type B blood, ( I B I B and I B i ).
If a person is heterozygous for both the I A and I B alleles, they will express both and have type AB blood with both proteins on each red blood cell.
This pattern of inheritance is significantly different than Mendelâ€™s rules for inheritance, because both alleles are expressed completely, and one does not mask the other.
Incomplete dominance, as seen in sickle cell anemia, is a form of inheritance in which one allele is only partly dominant over the other allele, resulting in an intermediate phenotype.
Codominance, as in human blood type, is a form of inheritance in which both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype of the heterozygote.
