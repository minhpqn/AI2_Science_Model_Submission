What type of mirror is used for this purpose?
What type of image does it form?
Relate the speed of light to its medium.
Describe refraction and explain when it occurs.
Is this some kind of magic trick?
Or is this straw really broken where it enters the water?
The answer to both questions is no.
There’s nothing wrong with the straw, and no magic is involved.
It’s simply how light may behave when it enters a new medium.
Speed of Light and Matter
Light always travels at the same speed across space.
That speed, represented by the letter c, is about 300 million meters per second.
However, when light travels through a medium, it travels more slowly.
The speed varies for different kinds of matter.
The Table below gives the speed of visible light in six different materials.
Speed of Visible Light (m/s)
Q:
Predict the speed of visible light through vinegar.
A:
Vinegar is mostly water, so if you predicted that the speed of light through vinegar would be close to its speed through water, you are correct.
