Note that just a small section of the rubber polymer is represented by the structural formula.
Cellulose is a natural polymer of the monomer named glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ).
This polymer makes up the cell walls of plants and is the most common compound in living things.
Structural formulas for cellulose and glucose are also shown in the Figure below ).
As you can see from the structural formula for cellulose, when two glucose monomers bond together, a molecule of water (H 2 O) is released.
Cellulose is created by the polymerization of glucose
Q:
How are the glucose molecules arranged in the cellulose polymer?
A:
The glucose molecules alternate between right-side up and upside down.
Synthetic Carbon Polymers
Synthetic carbon polymers are produced in labs or factories.
Plastics are common examples of synthetic carbon polymers.
You are probably familiar with the plastic called polyethylene.
All of the plastic items pictured in the Figure below are made of polyethylene.
It consists of repeating monomers of ethylene (C 2 H 4 ).
Structural formulas for ethylene and polyethylene are also shown in the Figure below .
