Marine Food Chains
Understand where the food energy comes from for marine food chains.
What's the most unusual life form you could see on Earth?
Some people might disagree.
But the most unusual life on Earth could be the strange organisms that live at hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges.
These organisms break down chemicals to make food energy.
They engage in chemosynthesis.
Would you like to see an ecosystem with chemosynthesis at its base?

Phytoplankton form the base of the food chain.
Phytoplankton are the most important primary producers in the ocean.
