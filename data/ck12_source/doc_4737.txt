What is a laboratory?
When most people think of a scientific laboratory, they picture images similar to those shown here.
And it's true that a laboratory must be a controlled environment, but what if certain studies cannot be done in a laboratory setting?
How do you observe penguins or elephants in their natural environments?
What is the lab then?
A laboratory is a place that has controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be carried out.
Scientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities, in industries, in government facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft, such as the one shown in Figure below .
Labs are not always Earth-bound, like the biochemistry lab to the left is.
This astronaut is working in a lab on the International Space Station (right).
Because of the different areas of science, there are many different types of science labs that each include different scientific equipment.
For example, a physics lab might contain a particle accelerator, in which the particles that make up atoms are studied.
A chemistry or biology lab most likely contains a fume hood where substances with poisonous fumes can be worked.
A particle accelerator and a fume hood are both shown in Figure below .
