If it is long and slithers, you probably call it as a snake.
How do you make these decisions?
You look at the physical features of the organism and think about what it has in common with other organisms.
Scientists do the same thing when they classify , or put into categories, living things.
Scientists classify organisms not only by their physical features, but also by how closely related they are.
Lions and tigers look like each other more than they look like bears, but are lions and tigers related?
Evolutionarily speaking, yes.
Evolution is the change in a species over time.
Lions and tigers both evolved from a common ancestor.
So it turns out that the two cats are actually more closely related to each other than to bears.
How an organism looks and how it is related to other organisms determines how it is classified.
Linnaean System of Classification
People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years.
Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a classification system that divided living things into several groups that we still use today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles.
Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778) ( Figure below ) built on Aristotleâ€™s work to create his own classification system.
He invented the way we name organisms today, with each organism having a two word name.
Linnaeus is considered the inventor of modern taxonomy , the science of naming and grouping organisms.

In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete classification system then known.
Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature , a way to give a scientific name to every organism.
