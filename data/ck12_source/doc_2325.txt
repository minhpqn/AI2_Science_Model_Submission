This would lower manufacturing costs as well as save natural resources.
How Technology Evolves
New technologies such as 3-D printers often evolve slowly as new materials, designs, or processes are invented.
Solar-powered cars are a good example.
For several decades, researchers have been working on developing practical solar-powered cars.
Why?
Cars powered by sunlight have at least two important advantages over gas-powered cars.
The energy they use is free and available almost everywhere, and they produce no pollution.
The timeline in Table below shows some of the milestones in the evolution of solar-powered cars.
Evolution of Solar-Powered Cars
1954:
First modern solar cell
The first modern solar cell was invented in 1954 by a team of researchers at Bell Labs in the U.S.
It could convert light energy to enough electricity to power devices.
1955:
First solar car
In 1955, William G.
Cobb of General Motors demonstrated his 15-inch-long “Sunmobile,” the world's first solar-powered automobile.
Its tiny electric motor was powered by 12 solar cells on top of the car.
1983:
