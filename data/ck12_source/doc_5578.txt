When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, the test tube becomes very warm as energy is released during the reaction.
Some other reactions absorb energy.
While energy changes are a potential sign of a chemical reaction, care must be taken to ensure that a chemical reaction is indeed taking place.
Physical changes also involve a transfer of energy.
Melting of a solid absorbs energy, while the condensation of a gas releases energy.
The only way to be certain that a chemical reaction has taken place is to test the composition of the substances after the change has taken place to see if they are different from the starting substances.
There are four visual clues that indicate that a chemical reaction is likely occurring.
A change of color occurs during the reaction.
A gas is produced during the reaction.
A solid product called a precipitate is produced in the reaction.
A transfer of energy occurs as a result of the reaction.
