Large lakes are similar to oceans.
They have tides and currents.
Large lakes can affect weather patterns.
The Great Lakes ( Figure below ) contain 22% of the world’s fresh surface water.
The largest of them, Lake Superior, has a tide that rises and falls several centimeters each day.
The Great Lakes cause “lake effect” snow.
In the winter, a large amount of snow may fall downwind of the relatively warm lakes.
The Great Lakes are home to countless species of fish and wildlife.

The Great Lakes of North America get their name from their great size.
Many lakes are not natural, but are human-made.
People dam a stream in a suitable spot.
Water backs up behind the dam, creating a lake.
These lakes are "reservoirs" ( Figure below ).
Hoover Dam created Lake Mead along the Colorado River
Hoover Dam, near Las Vegas, Nevada, creates a reservoir on the Colorado River.
The reservoir is called Lake Mead.
Ponds are small water bodies often fed by springs.
A lake or pond may form wherever water can collect.
A lake basin could be a volcanic crater, where a glacier has carved out a depression, or a fault zone.
