Etching of glass is a slow process that can produce beautiful artwork.
Traditionally, the glass has been treated with dilute hydrofluoric acid which gradually dissolves the glass under it.
Parts of the piece that should not be etched are covered with wax or some other non-reactive material.
In more recent times, compounds such as ammonium bifluoride have been used.
Whichever chemical is employed, the artist must be very careful not to get any on their skin.
Strong and Weak Acids and Acid Ionization Constant
Acids are classified as either strong or weak, based on their ionization in water.
A strong acid is an acid which is completely ionized in an aqueous solution.
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) ionizes completely into hydrogen ions and chloride ions in water.
\text{HCl}(g) \rightarrow \text{H}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq)
A weak acid is an acid that ionizes only slightly in an aqueous solution.
Acetic acid (found in vinegar) is a very common weak acid.
Its ionization is shown below.
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}(aq) \rightleftarrows \text{H}^+(aq) + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-(aq)
The ionization of acetic acid is incomplete, and so the equation is shown with a double arrow.
The extent of ionization of weak acids varies, but is generally less than 10%.
A 0.10 M solution of acetic acid is only about 1.3% ionized, meaning that the equilibrium strongly favors the reactants.
Weak acids, like strong acids, ionize to yield the H + ion and a conjugate base.
Because HCl is a strong acid, its conjugate base (Cl âˆ’ ) is extremely weak.
The chloride ion is incapable of accepting the H + ion and becoming HCl again.
