Let’s say he has a mass of 80 kg.
Draw a free body diagram and explain (using Newton’s Laws) whether or not the rope will break.
Now the man ties one end of the rope to the ground and is held up by the other.
Does the rope break in this situation?
What precisely is the difference between this problem and the one before?
A crane is lowering a box of mass 50 kg with an acceleration of 2.0 \ m/s^2 .
Find the tension F_T in the cable.
If the crane lowers the box at a constant speed, what is the tension F_T in the cable?
A physics student weighing 500 N stands on a scale in an elevator and records the scale reading over time.
The data are shown in the graph below.
At time t = 0 , the elevator is at rest on the ground floor.
Draw a FBD for the person, labeling all forces.
What does the scale read when the elevator is at rest?
Calculate the acceleration of the person from 5-10 sec.
Calculate the acceleration of the person from 10-15 sec.
Is the passenger at rest?
Calculate the acceleration of the person from 15-20 sec.
In what direction is the passenger moving?
Is the elevator at rest at t=25 \ s .
Justify your answer.
