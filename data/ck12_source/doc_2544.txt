The rest of the atom is empty space except for the electrons scattered through it.
In Rutherford’s model of the atom, which is shown in the Figure below , the electrons move around the massive nucleus like planets orbiting the sun.
That’s why his model is called the planetary model.
Rutherford didn’t know exactly where or how electrons orbit the nucleus.
That research would be undertaken by later scientists, beginning with Niels Bohr in 1913.
New and improved atomic models would also be developed.
Nonetheless, Rutherford’s model is still often used to represent the atom.

Rutherford's planetary model
Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus of the atom in 1910.
He sent a beam of alpha particles toward gold foil and observed the way the particles were deflected by the gold atoms.
From his results, he concluded that all of the positive charge and virtually all of the mass of an atom are concentrated in one tiny area, called the nucleus, and the rest of the atom is mostly empty space.
In Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom, the electrons move through empty space around the tiny positive nucleus like planets orbiting the sun.
