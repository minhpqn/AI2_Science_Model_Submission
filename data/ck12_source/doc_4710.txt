However, like natural experiments, field experiments can become contaminated, and conditions like the weather are not easy to control.
Experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab.

A prediction is a statement that tells what will happen under specific conditions.
It can be expressed in the form:
If A is true, then B will also be true.
Predictions are based on confirmed hypotheses shown to be true or not proved to be false.
For researchers to be confident that their predictions will be useful and descriptive, their data must have as few errors as possible.
Accuracy is the measure of how close a calculated or measured quantity is to its actual value.
Accuracy is closely related to precision , also called reproducibility or repeatability, which is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results.
The reproducibility and repeatability of experiments are cornerstones of scientific methods.
If no other researcher can reproduce or repeat the results of a certain study, then the results of the study will not be accepted as valid.
Results are considered valid only if they are both accurate and precise.
A useful tool to help explain the difference between accuracy and precision is a target, shown in Figure below .
In this analogy, repeated measurements are the arrows that are fired at a target.
Accuracy describes the closeness of arrows to the bulls eye at the center.
Arrows that hit closer to the bulls eye are more accurate.
Arrows that are grouped together more tightly are more precise.
