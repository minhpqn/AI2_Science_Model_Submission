But here’s a hint in advance.
Renewable energy resources include mechanical, electromagnetic, chemical, and thermal forms of energy.
What Are Renewable Resources?
Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply.
In addition to wind, renewable energy resources include sunlight, moving water, biomass, and geothermal energy.
All of these resources are freely available and won’t run out.
Most of them also have the advantage of producing little if any pollution or carbon dioxide, which contributes to global climate change.
Nonetheless, these energy resources are used far less than nonrenewable energy resources, especially fossil fuels.
You can see where renewable energy resources are used in the U.S., as well as learn more about them, at this URL:
Wind is moving air, so it has mechanical energy that can do work.
People have been using wind for energy for thousands of years.
The old-fashioned windmill in the Figure below is one way that wind energy can be used.
The wind turbines in the opening photo above are a much newer way of using wind energy.
They change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy.
However, only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce much electricity.
Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy, dangerous to birds, and unattractive in the landscape.
At the URL below, you can watch a video about the development of wind energy in China, which aims to become a world leader in renewable energy production.
Windmills have been used for centuries
This old windmill uses wind energy to operate a mechanical pump that lifts water out of a well.
Windmills like this one have been used for centuries.
