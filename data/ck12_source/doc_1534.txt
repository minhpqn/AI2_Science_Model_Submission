Why is ozone important?
Why doesn't air mix much in the stratosphere?
What is the ozone layer?
Why is it important?
Why does air temperature increase with height in the stratosphere?
Describe the mesosphere.
Describe the phenomena that appear in the mesosphere.
Next up:
A field trip to the mesosophere!
Not so fast.
The mesosphere is the least known layer of the atmosphere.
The mesosphere lies above the highest altitude an airplane can go.
It lies below the lowest altitude a spacecraft can orbit.
Maybe that's just as well.
If you were in the mesosphere without a space suit, your blood would boil!
This is because the pressure is so low that liquids would boil at normal body temperature.
The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere.
It rises to about 85 kilometers (53 miles) above the surface.
Temperature decreases with altitude in this layer.
