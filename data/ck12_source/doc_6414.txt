The [OH − ] is then found from 10 -1.69 = 2.04 × 10 -2  M.
The ICE table is then set up as shown below.
[C 2 H 5 NH 2 ]
[C 2 H 5 NH 3 + ]
[OH − ]
Substituting into the  K_b expression yields the  K_b for ethylamine.
K_b=\frac{[\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}^+_3][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2]}=\frac{(2.04 \times 10^{-2})(2.04 \times 10^{-2})}{0.730}=5.7 \times 10^{-4}
Calculations of  K_a and  K_b are described.
