Q:
Lavoisier carried out his experiments inside a sealed glass jar.
Why was sealing the jar important for his results?
What might his results have been if he hadn’t sealed the jar?
A:
Sealing the jar was important so that any gases produced in the reactions were captured and could be measured.
If he hadn’t sealed the jar, gases might have escaped detection.
Then his results would have shown that there was less mass after the reactions than before.
In other words, he would not have been able to conclude that mass is conserved in chemical reactions.
A chemical reaction occurs when some substances change chemically to other substances.
Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations.
All chemical equations must be balanced because matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions.
Antoine Lavoisier did careful experiments to discover the law of conservation of mass in chemical reactions.
