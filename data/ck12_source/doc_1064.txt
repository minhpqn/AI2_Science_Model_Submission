The Navajo sandstone is a rock formed from ancient sand dunes.
The rock shows that the ancient wind direction changed from time to time.
This is just one example of how geologists use observations they make today to unravel what happened in Earth’s past.
Rocks formed from volcanoes, oceans, rivers, and many other features are deciphered by looking at the geological work those features do today.
You may need to apply what you know about the present to determine what happened in the past.
The idea that the present is the key to the past was recognized by James Hutton in the late 1700s.
If you see something forming by a process today and then find the end results of that process in the rock record, you can assume that the the process operated the same way in the past.
