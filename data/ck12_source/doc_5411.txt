Mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes may lead to cancer.
Usually mutations in multiple genes are necessary to develop cancer.
Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.
Describe how carcinogenesis begins?
What are hyperplasia and dysplasia?
Distinguish between proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
Describe what happens to chemical carcinogens once inside the body.
Test Neurofibromin Activity in a Cell at
Discuss the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in carcinogenesis.
Why are multiple mutations required for transformation into a cancerous cell?
Identify all the categories of oncogenes and describe two categories.
Regulation of Gene Expression - Advanced
Explain the importance of the regulation of gene expression.
Describe general mechanisms of gene expression.
Can your expression change at any moment?
As you know, a person's expression can change moment by moment.
The expression that is demonstrated is usually appropriate for that moment's feelings.
Gene expression is the use of a gene whose product is necessary for that moment.
It may be a moment during development, it may be a moment of increased anxiety, or it may be in response to an environmental change.
Whenever a particular protein is needed, gene expression provides it.
