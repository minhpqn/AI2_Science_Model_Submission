Calculating Distance or Time from Speed
If you know the average speed of a moving object, you can calculate the distance it will travel in a given period of time or the time it will take to travel a given distance.
To calculate distance from speed and time, use this version of the average speed formula given above:
distance = speed × time
For example, if a car travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 5 hours, then the distance it travels is:
distance = 60 km/h × 5 h = 300 km
To calculate time from speed and distance, use this version of the formula:
Q:
If you walk 6 km at an average speed of 3 km/h, how much time does it take?
A:
Use the formula for time as follows:
\text{time} & =\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}\\\& =\frac{6 \ \text{km}}{3 \ \text{km/h}}\\\& =2 \ \text{h}
How fast or slow something moves is its speed.
The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s).
Average speed is calculated with this formula: \text{speed}=\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}
Speed may be constant, but often it varies from moment to moment.
Speed at any given instant is called instantaneous speed.
It is much more difficult to calculate than average speed.
Distance or time can be calculated by solving the average speed formula for distance or time.
