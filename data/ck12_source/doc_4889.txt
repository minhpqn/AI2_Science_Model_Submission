The Fluid Mosaic Model - Advanced
Describe the Fluid Mosaic Model of the plasma membrane.
Fluid and mosaic?
In this artistic impression of a plasma membrane of a human cell, the plasma membrane is shown as a bilayer composed of phospholipids with transmembrane and surface proteins.
The phospholipids create a fluid environment full of a mosaic of proteins.
The Fluid Mosaic Model
In 1972, S.
J.
Singer and G.
L.
Nicolson proposed the now widely accepted Fluid Mosaic Model of the structure of cell membranes ( Science, 175: 720-731).
Remember, it is the cell membrane that keeps the cell's internal environment separate from its surroundings, but it is also this membrane that constantly and consistently allows the cell to interact and exchange materials with its environment.
The Fluid Mosaic Model proposes that integral membrane proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer , as seen in the opening image.
