For example, oxygen is gas above -183째C, but iron is a gas only above 2861째C.
These differences explain why some substances are always solids at normal Earth temperatures, whereas others are always gases or liquids.
Matter constantly goes through cycles that involve changing states.
Water and all the elements important to organisms, including carbon and nitrogen, are constantly recycled on Earth (see Principles of Ecology ).
As matter moves through its cycles, it changes state repeatedly.
For example, in the water cycle, water repeatedly changes from a gas to a liquid or solid and back to a gas again.
How does this happen?
Adding energy to matter gives its atoms or molecules the ability to resist some of the forces holding them together.
For example, heating ice to its melting point (0째C) gives its molecules enough energy to move.
The ice melts and becomes liquid water.
Similarly, heating liquid water to its boiling point (100째C) gives its molecules enough energy to pull apart from one another so they no longer have contact.
The liquid water vaporizes and becomes water vapor.
In biological systems, matter is continuously changing states as well.
For example, carbon in the form of the gas carbon dioxide is changed into glucose, a solid.
This change, of course, occurs during photosynthesis.
During cellular respiration, carbons from the glucose molecule are changed back into the carbon dioxide gas.
Conservation of Matter
Though matter can change states, and it often does, matter cannot be created or destroyed.
Similar to the law of the conservation of energy, the law of conservation of mass states that the mass (or matter) of an isolated system will remain constant over time.
This means that mass or matter cannot be created or destroyed, although it may be rearranged and changed into different types of substances.
