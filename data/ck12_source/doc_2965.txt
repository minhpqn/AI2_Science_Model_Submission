Use vector arrows to represent the velocity of a car that travels north at 50 mi/h and then travels east at 25 mi/h.
Another car travels northwest for 2 hours and covers a distance of 90 miles.
What is the average velocity of the car?
Give examples of acceleration.
Describe how it feels to accelerate.
Imagine the thrill of riding on a roller coaster like this one!
The coaster slowly crawls to the top of the track and then flies down the other side.
It also zooms around twists and turns at breakneck speeds.
These changes in speed and direction are what make a roller coaster ride so exciting.
Changes in speed or direction are called acceleration.
Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object.
It measures the rate at which velocity changes.
Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both.
Both velocity and acceleration are vectors.
A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction.
People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration.
In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration.
A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.
Q:
Can you think of an example of acceleration that doesnâ€™t involve a change in speed?
