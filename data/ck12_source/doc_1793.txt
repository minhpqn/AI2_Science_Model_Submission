The climate is cold.
Mechanical weathering dominates the weathering here.
Can you find signs of mechanical weathering in the photo?
Can you see evidence of chemical weathering in the photo?
Why is mechanical weathering so much more important than chemical weathering here?
How is mechanical weathering altering the landscape in the high Sierra?
Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller pieces.
These smaller pieces are just like the bigger rock; they're just smaller!
The rock has broken without changing its composition.
The smaller pieces have the same minerals in the same proportions.
You could use the expression “a chip off the old block“ to describe mechanical weathering!
The main agents of mechanical weathering are water, ice, and wind.
Rocks can break apart into smaller pieces in many ways.
Ice wedging is common where water goes above and below its freezing point ( Figure below ).
This can happen in winter in the mid-latitudes or in colder climates in summer.
Ice wedging is common in mountainous regions like the Sierra Nevada pictured above.

This is how ice wedging works.
When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume.
