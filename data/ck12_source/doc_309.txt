specific heat:  The heat required to raise a unit mass of a substance by one unit temperature interval under specified conditions, such as constant pressure: usually measured in joules per kelvin per kilogram.
Understand the function of a calorimeter.
Apply the law of conservation of energy to calorimeter calculations of temperature changes due to heat transfer.

Though not particularly beautiful machines, calorimeters are incredibly useful ones.
They are used to determine the calories (food energy) in food, as well as the average heat yield from burning various grades of coal and oil.
The price of coal is often dependent on the heat yield from samples burned in a calorimeter.
A calorimeter is a device used to measure changes in thermal energy or heat transfer.
More specifically, it measures calories.
A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius.
As such, the calorimeter measures the temperature change of a known amount of water.
If a reaction is carried out in the reaction vessel, or if a measured mass of heated substance is placed in the water of the calorimeter, the change in the water temperature allows us to calculate the change in thermal energy.

The function of the calorimeter depends on the conservation of energy in a closed, isolated system.
Calorimeters are carefully insulated so that heat transfer in or out is negligible.
Consider the following example.
Example Problem:  A 0.500 kg sample of water in a calorimeter is at 15.0ºC.
A 0.0400 kg block of zinc at 115.0ºC is placed in the water.
The specific heat of zinc is 388 J/kg•ºC.
Find the final temperature of the system.
