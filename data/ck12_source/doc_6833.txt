The colossal squid, one of the largest invertebrates, measures 14 feet in length here.
Some of these squids are even larger and can grow up to almost 50 feet long!
The smallest mollusks are snails that are microscopic in size.
Types of Mollusks
There are approximately 160,000 living species and probably 70,000 extinct species of mollusks.
They are typically divided into ten classes, of which two are extinct.
The major classes of living mollusks include gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods ( Figure below
Gastropods include snails and slugs.
They use their foot to crawl.
They have a well-developed head.
There are many thousands of species of sea snails and sea slugs, as well as freshwater snails, freshwater limpets, land snails and land slugs.
Gastropods live in many diverse habitats, from gardens to deserts and mountains.
They also live in rivers, lakes and the ocean.
Most shelled gastropods have a one-piece shell that is typically coiled or spiraled, but not all gastropods have shells.
Gastropods have no sense of hearing, but they can see and have a keen sense of smell.
In land-based gastropods, the olfactory organs (for smell) are the most important.
These are located on the tentacles.
Bivalves include clams, scallops, oysters, and mussels.
As their name implies, they have two parts of their shell, which can open and close.
Bivalves live in both marine and freshwater habitats.
