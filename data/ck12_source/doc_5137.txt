Each human somatic cell (a body cell, or every cell other than a gamete) normally has two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent.
These cells are said to have a diploid number of chromosomes.
Each set contains 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes.
Each chromosome differs in size, from about 250 million nucleotide pairs on the largest chromosome (chromosome #1) to less than 50 million nucleotide pairs on chromosome #22.
Each chromosome contains a specific set of genes, as well as regulatory elements and other nucleotide sequences, making each chromosome essential to survival.
Each pair of chromosomes consists of two chromosomes that are similar in size and shape.
They contain the same genes at the same loci , though they may have different alleles.
These pairs of chromosomes are known as homologous chromosomes , or homologues .
Upon fertilization, a zygote is formed ( Figure below ).
A zygote is the first cell of a new individual.
In humans, a zygote contains 23 pairs (or two sets) of chromosomes.
Any cell containing two sets of chromosomes is said to be diploid.
The zygote forms from the fusion of two haploid gametes.
A haploid cell contains one set of chromosomes.
In humans, a haploid gamete contains 23 chromosomes.
Biologists use the symbol n to represent one set of chromosomes, and 2n to represent two sets.
Homologous chromosomes form a pair, one from each parent.
Homologous chromosomes are similar in size and shape, and contain the same genes, though they may have different alleles.
Alleles are alternative forms of the same gene.
This diagram represents two pairs of homologous chromosomes.
