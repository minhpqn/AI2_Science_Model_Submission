Early scientists viewed oxidation as a process in which a substance was reacted with oxygen to produce one or more oxides.
In the previous examples, magnesium and methane are being oxidized.
Oxidation is also defined as a loss of hydrogen atoms.
In the following equation, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde by the loss of two hydrogen atoms:
\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CHO} + 2\text{H atoms}
Oxidation does not necessarily require heating.
Iron that is exposed to air and water slowly oxidizes in a process commonly known as rusting.
Bleaches contain various compounds such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), which release oxygen that oxidizes stains.
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) releases oxygen as it spontaneously decomposes.
It acts as a bleach and an antiseptic that kills bacteria by oxidizing them.
The chemical reaction that is the opposite of oxidation is called reduction.
Following from the notion that oxidation was originally thought to mean only the addition of oxygen, reduction was thought to be only the removal of oxygen from a substance.
Many naturally occurring metal ores are present as oxides.
The pure metals can be extracted by reduction.
Iron is obtained from iron(III) oxide by reacting with carbon at high temperatures.
2\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)+3\text{C}(s) \rightarrow 4\text{Fe}(s)+3\text{CO}_2(g)
The removal of oxygen from the Fe 2 O 3 means that it is being reduced to Fe.
Note that an oxidation process is simultaneously occurring.
The carbon reactant is being oxidized to CO 2 .
This is an important concept.
