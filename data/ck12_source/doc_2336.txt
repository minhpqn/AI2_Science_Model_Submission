This discovery played an important role in the history of science.
It led to a scientific revolution that gave birth to modern Western science.
And it all began with technology!
Galileo and his telescope
Galileo is shown here presenting his telescope to government leaders.
They must have been impressed.
They gave him a life-long job as a university professor and doubled his salary.
There are many other examples that show how technology and science work together.
Two are pictured in Figure below .
Another example is the microscope.
It may have been invented by Galileo around the same time as the telescope.
Like the invention of the telescope, the invention of the microscope also depended on scientific knowledge of light and lenses.
Q:
How do you think the invention of the microscope helped science advance?
A:
The microscope let scientists view a world of tiny objects they had never seen before.
It led to many important scientific discoveries, including the discovery of cells, which are the basic building blocks of all living things.
Seismometers and spectrometers are both technological devices that led to important scientific discoveries.
Science and technology help each other advance.
Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies.
