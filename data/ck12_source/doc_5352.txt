Describe how transcription makes RNA from a DNA template.
How does a cell use the information in its DNA?
To transcribe means "to paraphrase or summarize in writing." The information in DNA is transcribed - or summarized - into a smaller version - RNA - that can be used by the cell.
This process is called transcription.
Only certain specific "segments" - genes - in the DNA are transcribed at any one time.
Transcription is “DNA → RNA.” In other words, transcription is the transfer of the genetic instructions from DNA to RNA.
During transcription, a complementary copy of RNA is made.
Whereas in DNA replication both strands of the DNA double helix are used as templates, in transcription only one strand is needed.
RNA polymerase enzymatically “reads” a template strand of DNA, known as the coding strand, to synthesize the complementary RNA strand.
Transcription is usually divided into 3 stages, appropriately named initiation, elongation and termination.
In eukaryotes, transcription can be additionally divided into 5 stages: preinitiation, initiation, promoter clearance, elongation and termination.
