The Immune System's Second Line of Defense
The little girl pictured below ( Figure below ) has a scraped knee.
A scrape is a break in the skin that may let pathogens enter the body.
If bacteria enter through the scrape, they could cause an infection.
These bacteria would then face the bodyâ€™s second line of defense.
The second line of defense is also nonspecific, fighting many types of pathogens.
Scrapes should be kept clean and protected to prevent them from getting infected
