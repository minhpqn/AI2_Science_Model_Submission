Prokaryotic cells are distinguished by their shape.
And as you can imagine, shape may have something to do with mobility.
Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells.
Although they are tiny, prokaryotic cells can be distinguished by their shapes.
The most common shapes are helices, spheres, and rods (see Figure below ).

The three most common prokaryotic cell shapes are shown here.
Plasma Membrane and Cell Wall
Like other cells, prokaryotic cells have a plasma membrane (see Figure below ).
It controls what enters and leaves the cell.
It is also the site of many metabolic reactions.
For example, cellular respiration and photosynthesis take place in the plasma membrane.
Most prokaryotes also have a cell wall.
It lies just outside the plasma membrane.
It gives strength and rigidity to the cell.
Bacteria and Archaea differ in the makeup of their cell wall.
The cell wall of Bacteria contains peptidoglycan , composed of sugars and amino acids.
The cell wall of most Archaea lacks peptidoglycan.
