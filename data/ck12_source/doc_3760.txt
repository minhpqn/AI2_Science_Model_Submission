The conditions required for fossils to form rarely occur.
Therefore, the chance of an organism being preserved as a fossil is very low.
You can watch a video at the following link to see in more detail how fossils form:  .

The photo on the left shows an ancient frog trapped in hardened tree resin, or amber.
The photo on the right shows the fossil footprints of a dinosaur.
In order for fossils to “tell” us the story of life, they must be dated.
Then they can help scientists reconstruct how life changed over time.
Fossils can be dated in two different ways: relative dating and absolute dating.
Both are described below.
You can also learn more about dating methods in the video at this link:
Relative dating determines which of two fossils is older or younger than the other, but not their age in years.
Relative dating is based on the positions of fossils in rock layers.
Lower layers were laid down earlier, so they are assumed to contain older fossils.
This is illustrated in Figure below .
Absolute dating determines about how long ago a fossil organism lived.
This gives the fossil an approximate age in years.
Absolute dating is often based on the amount of carbon-14 or other radioactive element that remains in a fossil.
You can learn more about carbon-14 dating by watching the animation at this link:
