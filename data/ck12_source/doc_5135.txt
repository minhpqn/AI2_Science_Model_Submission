How many chromosomes do humans have?
Chromosomal Division - Advanced
Describe the basic properties of chromosomes.
How is it assured that every cell in your body has the same DNA?
Chromosomes, like those shown here, must form prior to cell division, to ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic material.
Each chromosome is made of two identical sister chromatids.
Each chromatid is 1/2 of the "X." Essentially, each daughter cell receives half of each "X-shaped" chromosome.
DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes
DNA contains the information necessary to make proteins, direct a cellâ€™s activities, and give an organism its traits.
Obviously, it is a very important molecule.
Actually , in human cells, DNA is organized into 46 molecules called chromosomes.
See DNA is packaged in a chromosome at  to see Roger Kornberg speak about his work.
The information in DNA is organized into structural units scattered along the length of the DNA molecule.
These units are known as genes .
A gene contains the information necessary to encode an RNA molecule or a protein.
A diploid human cell has about 44,000 genes; two copies of each of about 22,000 genes.
So, a single DNA molecule contains hundreds to thousands of genes.
Through the process of gene expression, which involves transcription and translation , different cell types use the information in different genes to make different proteins.
This process gives different cell types distinct activities.
Thus, a liver cell will have many different proteins than a kidney cell, giving the two cells types distinct activities.
