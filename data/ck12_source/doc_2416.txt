Flammability is the ability of matter to burn.
When matter burns, it combines with oxygen and changes to different substances.
Wood is an example of flammable matter, as seen in Figure below .
Wood burning in a fire
When wood burns, it changes to ashes, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases.
You can see ashes in the wood fire pictured here.
The gases are invisible.
Q:
How can you tell that wood ashes are a different substance than wood?
A:
Ashes have different properties than wood.
For example, ashes are gray and powdery, whereas wood is brown and hard.
Q:
What are some other substances that have the property of flammability?
A:
Substances called fuels have the property of flammability.
They include fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum, as well as fuels made from petroleum, such as gasoline and kerosene.
Substances made of wood, such as paper and cardboard, are also flammable.
Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different kind of matter.
They include reactivity, flammability, and the ability to rust.
