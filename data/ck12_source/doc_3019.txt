Therefore, if you know the mass of an object, you can calculate its weight using this equation:
F = m × 9.8 m/s 2
Q :
Sam has a mass of 50 kilograms.
What is his weight in Newtons?
A :
You can calculate Sam’s weight in Newtons by substituting his mass in kilograms into the weight formula:
F = m × 9.8 m/s 2 = 50 kg × 9.8 m/s 2 = 490 kg *bull; m/s 2 , or 490 N
You’re probably more familiar with weight in pounds (lb) than in Newtons.
One Newton equals 0.225 pounds.
In other words, there are 0.225 pounds per Newton.
You can use this ratio to convert Newtons to pounds.
Q :
What is Sam’s weight in pounds?
A :
In pounds, Sam’s weight is 490 N x 0.225 lb/N = 110 lb.
Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object.
It depends on the object’s mass and the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s 2 on Earth.
The formula for calculating weight is F = m × 9.8 m/s 2 , where F is the object’s weight in Newtons (N) and m is the object’s mass in kilograms.
The Newton is the SI unit for weight, and 1 Newton equals 0.225 pounds.
