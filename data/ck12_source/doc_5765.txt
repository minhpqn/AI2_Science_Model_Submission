In this reaction, sodium donates an electron and chlorine accepts it, giving each element an octet of valence electrons.
Some Uses of Noble Gases
Did you ever get helium balloons like those in the opening picture?
Unlike a balloon filled with air, a balloon filled with helium needs to be weighted down so it won’t float away — although you don’t have to use an elephant!.
Q:
Why does a helium balloon float away if it’s not weighted down?
A:
Helium atoms have just two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, so they have less mass than any other atoms except hydrogen.
As a result, helium is lighter than air, explaining why a helium balloon floats up into the air unless weighted down.
Early incandescent light bulbs, like the one pictured in the Figure below , didn’t last very long.
The filaments quickly burned out.
Although air was pumped out of the bulb, it wasn’t a complete vacuum.
Oxygen in the small amount of air remaining inside the light bulb reacted with the metal filament.
This corroded the filament and caused dark deposits on the glass.
Filling a light bulb with argon gas prevents these problems.
That’s why modern light bulbs are filled with argon.
Q:
How does argon prevent the problems of early light bulbs?
A:
As a noble gas with eight electrons, argon doesn’t react with the metal in the filament.
