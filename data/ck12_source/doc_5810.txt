This organism is a type of fungus-like protist, known as water mold.
Fungus-like protists share many features with fungi.
Like fungi, they are heterotrophs, meaning they must obtain food outside themselves.
They also have cell walls and reproduce by forming spores, just like fungi.
Fungus-like protists usually do not move, but a few develop movement at some point in their lives.
Two major types of fungus-like protists are slime molds and water molds .
Slime molds usually measure about one or two centimeters, but a few slime molds are as big as several meters.
They often have bright colors, such as a vibrant yellow ( Figure below ).
Others are brown or white.
Stemonitis is a kind of slime mold which forms small brown bunches on the outside of rotting logs.
Physarum polycephalum lives inside rotting logs and is a gooey mesh of yellow "threads" that are several centimeters long.
Fuligo , sometimes called “vomit mold,” is a yellow slime mold found in decaying wood.
An example of a slime mold.
Water molds mostly live in water or moist soil.
They can be parasites of plants and animals, getting their nutrients from these organisms and also from decaying organisms.
They are a common problem for farmers since they cause a variety of plant diseases.
One of the most famous of these diseases was the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine in the 1800s.
At this time, potatoes were the main source of food for many of the Irish people.
The failure of the potato crop meant that many people in Ireland died of starvation or migrated to other countries.
Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter.
