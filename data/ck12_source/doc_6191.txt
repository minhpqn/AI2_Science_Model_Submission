mass H 2 O 218 g = 0.218 kg
mass solute = 38.7 g
K_f(\text{H}_2\text{O})=-1.86^\circ \ \text{C}/m
molar mass solute = ? g/mol
Use the freeing point depression (\Delta T_f)  to calculate the molality of the solution.
Then use the molality equation to calculate the moles of solute.
Then divide the grams of solute by the moles to determine the molar mass.
Step 2:
Solve.
m=\frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f} &=\frac{-5.53^\circ \text{C}}{-1.86^\circ \text{C}/m}=2.97 \ m\\\text{mol solute} &= m \times \text{kg H}_2\text{O}=2.97 \ m \times 0.218 \text{ kg} = 0.648 \text{ mol}\\\frac{38.7 \text{ g}}{0.648 \text{ mol}} &= 59.7 \text{ g/mol}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The molar mass of the unknown solute is 59.7 g/mol.
Knowing the molar mass is an important step in determining the identity of an unknown.
A similar problem could be done with the change in boiling point.
