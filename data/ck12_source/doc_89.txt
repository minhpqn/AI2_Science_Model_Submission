How Do Frogs Eat?
Adult frogs are meat-eaters and eat mostly insects, spiders, slugs and worms.
Larger species will eat mice, birds, and even other small reptiles and amphibians.
Frogs do not have teeth on their lower jaw, so they usually swallow their food whole.
Some frogs have teeth on the upper jaw that are used to hold the prey in place.
Frogs and toads are responsible for keeping a large part of the world's insect population under control.
They catch these insects using their long tongue.
The frog tongue is about a third the length of the frog's body, though they can grow even longer.
They can easily reach 12 inches long in an adult frog.
Frog’s tongues are attached to the front of their mouths rather than at the back like humans.
They release a sticky substance at the precise moment of impact with their food.
When a frog catches an insect it throws its sticky tongue out of it’s mouth and wraps it around its prey.
The frog’s tongue then snaps back and throws the food down its throat.
This happens about as fast as a blink of your eyes.
Frogs are characterized by long hind legs, webbed finger-like parts, a tympanum, and the lack of a tail.
A frog's "ribbit" is a mating call used to attract females.
