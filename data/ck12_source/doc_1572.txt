Nitrogen and sulfur oxides form acid rain, which is described in the next concept.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is toxic to both plants and animals.
CO is deadly to people in a confined space, such as a closed home.
Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, so people can’t tell when they are breathing it.
That’s why homes should have carbon monoxide detectors.
Heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, are toxic to living things.
They can enter food chains from the atmosphere.
The metals build up in the tissues of organisms by bioaccumulation ( Figure below ).
Heavy metals accumulate as they are passed up a food chain.
Imagine a low-level consumer eating a producer.
That consumer takes in all of the heavy metals from all of the producers that it eats.
Then a higher-level consumer eats the low-level consumer.
The higher-level consumer accumulates all of the heavy metals from all of the lower-level consumers that it eats.
In this way, an organism accumulates a lot of heavy metals.
At high levels in the food chain, the heavy metals may become quite concentrated.
Bioaccumulation of mercury
This diagram shows how mercury bioaccumulates.
Compare the parts per million (ppm) of mercury in phytoplankton and gull eggs.
Can you explain the difference?
The higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of toxic metals they take in.
