A radioactive isotope, or radioisotope, has atoms with unstable nuclei.
The unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break down, by losing energy and particles of matter to become more stable.
If they gain or lose protons as they decay, they become different elements.
Over time, as the nuclei continue to decay, less and less of the original radioisotope remains.
Rate of Radioactive Decay
A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a constant rate.
The rate is measured in a unit called the half-life .
This is the length of time it takes for half of a given amount of the radioisotope to decay.
This rate is always the same for a given radioisotope, regardless of temperature, pressure, or other conditions outside the nuclei of its atoms.
Q:
How is repeatedly cutting paper in half like the decay of a radioisotope?
A:
As a radioisotope decays, the amount of the radioisotope decreases by half during each half-life, just as a piece of paper decreases in size by half each time you cut it down the center.
You can see a video of this half-life analogy at the following URL.
The concept of half-life is illustrated in the Figure below for the decay of phosphorus-32 to sulfur-32.
The half-life of phosphorus-32 is 14 days.
After 14 days, half of the original amount of phosphorus-32 has decayed, so only half remains.
After another 14 days, half of the remaining amount (or a quarter of the original amount) is still left, and so on.
