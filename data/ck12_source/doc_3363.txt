A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it.
You can see a solenoid in the Figure below .
Current flowing through the coil produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles.
You can see an actual solenoid with a compass showing its magnetic north pole at this URL:  .

Schematic of a solenoid
Q:
How is a solenoid like a bar magnet?
A:
Like a bar magnet, a solenoid has north and south magnetic poles and is surrounded by a magnetic field.
Strength of a Solenoid
Any wire with current flowing through it has a magnetic field.
However, the magnetic field around a coiled wire is stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire.
Thatâ€™s because each turn of the wire in the coil has its own magnetic field.
Adding more turns to the coil of wire increases the strength of the field.
Increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil also increases the strength of the magnetic field.
Uses of Solenoids
A solenoid is generally used to convert electromagnetic energy into motion.
Solenoids are often used in devices that need a sudden burst of power to move a specific part.
In addition to paintball markers, you can find solenoids in machines ranging from motor vehicles to electric dishwashers.
