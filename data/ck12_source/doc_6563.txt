Can carboxyl groups form hydrogen bonds?
Do carboxylic acids ionize?
carboxyl group:
Contains the C=O of the carbonyl group, with the carbon atom also being bonded to a hydroxyl (−OH) group.
carboxylic acid:
An organic compound that contains the carboxyl functional group.

What is that smell?
Perfumes contain ingredients from a number of sources.
Musk is obtained from animals, but the vast majority of perfume components are obtained from plants.
Approximately 2,000 plant species have been used as sources for perfume materials.
The needed chemicals are extracted using solvent extraction or distillation.
The oils are diluted with ethanol to varying degrees, depending on the price of the finished product – the less ethanol present (meaning there is a higher percentage of the active odor ingredients), the more expensive the perfume.
An ester is an organic compound that is a derivative of a carboxylic acid in which the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group has been replaced with an alkyl group.
The structure is the product of a carboxylic acid (the R-portion) and an alcohol (the R’-portion).
The general formula for an ester is shown below.
