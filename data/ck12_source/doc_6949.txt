Two such force/velocity combinations are illustrated above.
According to our study of rotational motion, this implies that as long as the particle does not leave the region of the magnetic field, it will travel in a circle.
To find the radius of the circle, we set the magnitude of the centripetal force equal to the magnitude of the magnetic force and solve for  r  :
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = F_B = qvB\sin \theta = qvB\intertext{Therefore,}r = \frac{mv^2}{qvB}
In the examples above,  \theta  was conveniently 90 degrees, which made  \sin \theta = 1 .
But that does not really matter; in a constant magnetic fields a different  \theta  will simply decrease the force by a constant factor and will not change the qualitative behavior of the particle.

For each of the arrangements of velocity v and magnetic field B below, determine the direction of the force.
Assume the moving particle has a positive charge.
As an electron that is traveling in the positive x- direction encounters a magnetic field, it begins to turn in the upward direction (positive y- direction).
What is the direction of the magnetic field?
-" x "-direction
+" y "-direction (towards the top of the page)
-" z "-direction (i.e. into the page)
+" z "-direction (i.e. out of the page)
none of the above
A positively charged hydrogen ion turns upward as it enters a magnetic field that points into the page.
What direction was the ion going before it entered the field?
