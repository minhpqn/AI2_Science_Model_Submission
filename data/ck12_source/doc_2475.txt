Dew Point (°C)
Based on the dew points you calculated, how is relative humidity related to dew point?
How is air temperature related to dew point?
What is condensation?
Give an example.
Define dew point.
What factors influence dew point?
In the water cycle, how does water vapor in the atmosphere change to liquid water on the ground?
Define sublimation, and give an example.
State conditions under which sublimation of snow or ice occurs.
Rock bands often use special stage effects, like the fake fog in this picture.
Real fog forms when water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of water.
The fake fog shown here formed when solid carbon dioxide changed directly to carbon dioxide gas.
Solid carbon dioxide is also called dry ice.
That’s because when it gets warmer and changes state, it doesn’t change to a liquid by melting.
Instead, it changes directly to a gas without going through the liquid state.
The process in which a solid changes directly to a gas is called sublimation .
It occurs when energy is added to a solid such as dry ice.
You can watch dry ice changing directly to a gas in the video at this URL:  .
