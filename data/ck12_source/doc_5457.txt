These questions could start to be answered.
DNA sequencing was built upon earlier knowledge of DNA polymerases and DNA replication.
The chain-termination method , which makes use of a "defective" DNA nucleotide, is the basis of DNA sequencing.
This method is also known as the Sanger method, named after its developer Frederick Sanger.
In this process, one strand of DNA is used as a template, just as in DNA replication.
The nucleotide chain elongates as a deoxynucleotide (dNTP) is attached to the 3' carbon end of the chain based on the base-pair rules.
At the chain termination method, dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) are utilized in the sequencing reaction. ddNTPs lack a 3'-OH group necessary for elongation.
When a ddNTP is incorporated into the elongating chain, the elongation process stops at that base.
When four separate sequencing reactions are done, one each in the presence of a particular ddNTP, and the products are separated by size through gel electrophoresis , the DNA sequence can be read.
In A gene is a discrete sequence of DNA nucleotides at , Fred Sanger talks about developing DNA sequencing procedures.
