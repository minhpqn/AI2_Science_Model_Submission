Instead the arrow is called a yield sign and so the equation is described as “reactants yield products”.
You can describe a chemical reaction by writing a word equation .
When silver metal is exposed to sulfur it reacts to form silver sulfide.
Silver sulfide is commonly known as tarnish and turns the surface of silver objects dark and streaky black (see Figure below ).
The sulfur that contributes to tarnish can come from traces of sulfur in the air or from food such as eggs.
The word equation for the process is:
\text{Silver} + \text{sulfur} \rightarrow \text{Silver sulfide}
The silver and the sulfur are the reactants in the equation, while the silver sulfide is the product.
Tarnished silver contains silver sulfide
The coffee percolator on the left has been tarnished from exposure to sulfur.
Tarnish is the chemical compound silver sulfide.
The same percolator on the right has been polished with a tarnish removal product in order to restore its silver finish.
Another common chemical reaction is the burning of methane gas.
Methane is the major component of natural gas and is commonly burned on a gas stove or in a Bunsen burner ( Figure below ).
Burning is a chemical reaction in which some type of fuel is reacted with oxygen gas.
The products of the reaction in the burning of methane as well as other fuels are carbon dioxide and water.
The word equation for this reaction is:
\text{Methane}+\text{oxygen} \rightarrow \text{carbon dioxide}+\text{water}
A Bunsen burner reacts methane with oxygen to form water and carbon dioxide
A Bunsen burner is commonly used to heat substances in a chemistry lab.
