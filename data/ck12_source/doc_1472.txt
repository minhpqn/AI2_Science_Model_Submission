What is the salinity of seawater?
Average seawater is about 3.5% salt.
The amount is different if there is a nearby source of freshwater.
It is also different if there is a lot of evaporation in an area.
How do you think these things affect seawater salinity?
Seawater also contains other substances like sugars, acids, bases, and organic molecules.
Why Is Ocean Water Salty?
Ocean water is salty because water dissolves minerals out of rocks.
The ions enter the water.
This happens whenever water flows over or through rocks.
Much of this water and its minerals end up in the oceans.
Minerals dissolved in water form salts.
When the water evaporates, it leaves the salts behind.
As a result, ocean water is much saltier than other water on Earth.
How Salty Is Ocean Water?
Have you ever gone swimming in the ocean?
If you have, then you probably tasted the salts in the water.
By mass, salts make up about 3.5% of ocean water.
The table below shows the most common minerals in ocean water ( Table below ).
The main components are sodium and chloride.
