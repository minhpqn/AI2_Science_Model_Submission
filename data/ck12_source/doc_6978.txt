The closest star beyond our sun is Alpha Centauri, 4 LY away.
Some distant quasars are 2 billion LY away.
Why do astronomers say that to look at these distant objects is to look back in time?
Explain briefly.

Describe how our eye detects color and how color addition works.
Students will learn how our eye detects color and how color addition works.
Reflection and transmission of color in various situations is also covered.
White light consists of a mixture of all the visible colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV).
Our perception of the color black is tied to the absence of light.
Our eyes include color-sensitive and brightness-sensitive cells.
The three different color-sensitive cells (cones) can have sensitivity in three colors: red, blue, and green.
Our perception of other colors is made from the relative amounts of each color that the cones register from light reflected from the object we are looking at.
Our brightness-sensitive cells (rods) work well in low light.
This is why things look ‘black and white’ at night.
The chemical bonds in pigments and dyes – like those in a colorful shirt – absorb light at frequencies that correspond to certain colors.
When you shine white light on these pigments and dyes, some colors are absorbed and some colors are reflected.
We only see the colors that objects reflect .
