Due to the composition of the cell membrane, small molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass freely through the membrane, but other molecules, especially large molecules, cannot easily pass through the plasma membrane.
These molecules need assistance to get across the membrane.
That assistance will come in the form of transport proteins.
The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning only some molecules can get through.
The cell membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids, each with a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail.
