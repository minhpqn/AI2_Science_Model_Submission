Light enters the eye through an opening called the pupil .
The light then passes through the lens , which focuses it on the retina at the back of the eye.
The retina contains light receptor cells.
These cells send nerve impulses to the optic nerve , which carries the impulses to the brain.
The brain interprets the impulses and “tells” us what we are seeing.

The eye is the organ that senses light and allows us to see.
Hearing is the ability to sense sound waves, and the ear is the organ that senses sound.
Sound waves enter the auditory canal and travel to the eardrum (see Figure below ).
They strike the eardrum and make it vibrate.
The vibrations then travel through several other structures inside the ear and reach the cochlea.
The cochlea is a coiled tube filled with liquid.
The liquid moves in response to the vibrations, causing tiny hair cells lining the cochlea to bend.
In response, the hair cells send nerve impulses to the auditory nerve , which carries the impulses to the brain.
The brain interprets the impulses and “tells” us what we are hearing.
The ear is the organ that senses sound waves and allows us to hear.
It also senses body position so we can keep our balance.
The ears are also responsible for the sense of balance.
Balance is the ability to sense and maintain body position.
The semicircular canals inside the ear (see Figure above ) contain fluid that moves when the head changes position.
