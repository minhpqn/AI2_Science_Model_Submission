Peripheral Nervous System
Describe the structure and function of the peripheral nervous system.
Compare the sensory division to the motor division.
Explain the role of the somatic nervous system.
Distinguish the sympathetic division from the parasympathetic division.
How does the signal get to your toes?
If the brain controls practically everything, how does the signal get to your toes?
Or your legs?
Or arms?
By way of the peripheral nervous system, or all the nerves shown here other than the brain and spinal cord.
Notice how they go everywhere.
Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of all the nervous tissue that lies outside the central nervous system.
It is shown in yellow in Figure below .
It is connected to the central nervous system by nerves.
A nerve is a cable-like bundle of axons.
Some nerves are very long.
The longest human nerve is the sciatic nerve.
It runs from the spinal cord in the lower back down the left leg all the way to the toes of the left foot.
Like the nervous system as a whole, the peripheral nervous system also has two divisions: the sensory division and the motor division.
