In the descriptions that accompany the activity series of metals, a given metal is also capable of undergoing the reactions described below that section.
For example, lithium will react with cold water, replacing hydrogen.
It will also react with steam and with acids, since that requires a lower degree of reactivity.
Sample Problem:
Single-Replacement Reactions
Use the activity series to predict if the following reactions will occur.
If not, write NR.
If the reaction does occur, write the products of the reaction and balance the equation.
A. \text{Al}(s)+\text{Zn(NO}_3)_2 (aq) \rightarrow
B. \text{Ag}(s)+\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow
Step 1:
Plan the problem
For A, compare the placements of aluminum and zinc on the activity series.
For B, compare the placements of silver and hydrogen.
Step 2:
Solve
Since aluminum is above zinc, it is capable of replacing it and a reaction will occur.
The products of the reaction will be aqueous aluminum nitrate and solid zinc.
Take care to write the correct formulas for the products before balancing the equation.
Aluminum adopts a 3+ charge in an ionic compound, so the formula for aluminum nitrate is Al(NO 3 ) 3 .
