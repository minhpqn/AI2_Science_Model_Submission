Law of Independent Assortment
Mendel repeated this experiment with other combinations of characteristics, such as flower color and stem length.
Each time, the results were the same as those in Figure above .
The results of Mendelâ€™s second set of experiments led to his second law.
This is the law of independent assortment .
It states that factors controlling different characteristics are inherited independently of each other.
After his first set of experiments, Mendel researched two characteristics at a time.
This led to his law of independent assortment.
This law states that the factors controlling different characteristics are inherited independently of each other.
