If you measured the decay rates coming from each sample, which would you expect to have a higher decay rate ?
Why?
Answers to Selected Problems
a.
Substance A decays faster than B b.
Substance B because there is more material left to decay.
a. 5 \times 10^{24} atoms b.
Decay of a lot of atoms in a short period of time c. 2.5 \times 10^{24} atoms d. \frac{1}{2} e. 26.6 minutes
a.
Substance B = 4.6 \;\mathrm{g} and substance A = 0.035 \;\mathrm{g} b. substance B
The one with the short half life, because half life is the rate of decay.
Describe how carbon dating works.
Solve for the age of an artifact using the carbon dating technique.
Students will develop an understanding of how carbon dating works and also learn to solve for the age of an artifact using the carbon dating technique.
M = M_0 (\frac{1}{2})^{\frac{t}{t_H}}
The amount of mass M of the substance surviving after an original \mathit{M}_0 nuclei decay for time t with a half-life of \mathit{t}_H
Guidance Radioactive carbon dating is a technique that allows scientists to determine the era in which a sample of biological material died.
A small portion of the carbon we ingest every day is actually the radioactive isotope ^{14}\mathrm{C} rather than the usual ^{12}\mathrm{C} .
Since we ingest carbon every day until we die (we do this by eating plants; the plants do it through photosynthesis), the amount of ^{14}\mathrm{C} in us should begin to decrease from the moment we die.
By analyzing the ratio of the number of ^{14}\mathrm{C} to ^{12}\mathrm{C} atoms in dead carbon-based life forms (including cloth made from plants!), we can determine how long ago the life form died.
