Leaves tip, reflects off center of mirror with an angle of reflection equal to the angle of incidence.
( convex )
Ray #1:
Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the OPPOSITE side as the candle.
Ray #2:
Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel to the optic axis.
Ray #3:
Leaves tip, heads straight for the mirror center, and reflects at an equal angle.
In the situation illustrated below, the object is set up .5 m away from a converging mirror.
If the focal length of the lens is .2 m, determine (a) the location of the real image, and (b) the magnification of the image.
(a):
In order to determine the location of the image, we'll use the lens maker's equation.
\frac{1}{f}&=\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}\\\\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}\\\\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{.2\;\text{m}} - \frac{1}{.5\;\text{m}}\\\d_i&=.33\;\text{m}\\\
(b):
Now that we have the location of the image, we can find the magnification.

Here’s an example of the “flat mirror problem.” Marjan is looking at herself in the mirror.
Assume that her eyes are 10 cm below the top of her head, and that she stands 180 \;\mathrm{cm} tall.
