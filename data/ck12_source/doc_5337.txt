This structure depicts an RNA molecule. the numerous secondary structures, such as the helices, are visible.
DNA → RNA → Protein
The central dogma of molecular biology. “DNA makes RNA makes protein.” So what exactly is RNA?
Ribonucleic acid , or RNA , is the other important nucleic acid in this three player act.
When we say that “DNA makes RNA makes protein,” what do we mean?
We mean that the information in DNA is somehow transferred into RNA, and that the information in RNA is then used to make the protein.
But is all of the information in DNA transferred to RNA?
Or just some of the information?
Recall that a gene is a segment of DNA that contains the information necessary to encode an RNA molecule or a protein.
These genes are embedded within the DNA in the nucleus.
This DNA never leaves the nucleus.
So, how does the information get from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the ribosomes are?
Remember that the ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis .
To understand this, it helps to first understand RNA.
Keep in mind that even though you have many thousands of genes, not all are used in every cell type.
In fact, probably only a few thousand are used in a particular type of cell, with different cell types using different genes.
However, while these genes are embedded in the large chromosomes that never leave the nucleus, the RNA is relatively small and is easily able to carry information out of the nucleus.
This process occurs when the gene product is needed by the cell.
If all genes were "expressed" all the time in every cell, then all cells would be very similar, and it would be a tremendous waste of energy.
Instead, gene expression occurs only when the gene product is required by the cell.
