Baby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually accumulate.
The accumulating evidence lets scientists refine and expand on earlier ideas.
For example, the scientific idea of the atom was introduced in the early 1800s.
But scientists came to understand the structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two centuries.
Their understanding of atomic structure continues to expand today.
The advancement of science is sometimes a very bumpy road.
New knowledge and ideas aren’t always accepted at first, and scientists may be mocked for their ideas.
The idea that Earth’s continents drift on the planet’s surface is a good example.
This idea was first proposed by a scientist named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s.
Wegener also proposed that all of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent, which he named Pangaea (see Figure below ).
Other scientists not only rejected Wegener’s ideas, but ridiculed Wegener for even suggesting them.
It wasn’t until the 1950s that enough evidence had accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right.
Unfortunately, Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas accepted.
The supercontinent Pangaea
This map shows the supercontinent Pangaea, which was first proposed by Alfred Wegener.
Pangaea included all of the separate continents we know today.
Scientists now know that the individual continents drifted apart to their present locations over millions of years.
Q:
What types of evidence might support Wegener’s ideas?
