This is one stage in the process of reproduction in the mosses.
Remember mosses and other seedless plants do not have flowers, so their life cycle is quite different from other plants.
Reproduction in Seedless Plants
Seedless plants can reproduce asexually or sexually.
Some seedless plants, like hornworts and liverworts, can reproduce asexually through fragmentation.
When a small fragment of the plant is broken off, it can form a new plant.
Reproduction in Nonvascular Seedless Plants
Like all plants, nonvascular plants have an alternation of generations life cycle.
That means they alternate between diploid cell stages (having two sets of chromosomes) and haploid cell stages (having one set of chromosomes) during their life cycle.
Recall the haploid stage is called the gametophyte , and the diploid stage is called the sporophyte .
In the life cycle of the nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle.
The gametophyte is the green photosynthetic carpet that you would recognize as a moss.
The life cycle of nonvascular seedless plants can be described as follows:
The male gametophyte produces flagellated sperm that must swim to the egg formed by the female gametophyte.
For this reason, sexual reproduction must happen in the presence of water.
Therefore, nonvascular plants tend to live in moist environments.
Though the life of a nonvascular seedless plant is a cycle, this can be considered the initial step in the life cycle.
Following fertilization, the sporophyte forms.
The sporophyte is connected to, and dependent on, the gametophyte.
The sporophyte produces spores that will develop into gametophytes and start the cycle over again.
