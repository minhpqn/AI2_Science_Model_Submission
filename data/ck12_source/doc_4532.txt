What is cAMP?
How does it function?
Compare and contrast how steroid and non-steroid hormones affect target cells.
Describe feedback mechanisms that regulate hormone secretion.
Explain a negative feedback loop.
Distinguish between a negative feedback loop and a positive feedback loop.
On or off?
Hormones alter conditions inside the cell, usually in response to a stimulus.
That means they are activated at specific times.
So they must be turned on and then turned back off.
What turns these hormones and their responses on or off?
Hormone Regulation:
Feedback Mechanisms
Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis.
But what controls the hormones themselves?
Most hormones are regulated by feedback mechanisms.
A feedback mechanism is a loop in which a product feeds back to control its own production.
Most hormone feedback mechanisms involve negative feedback loops .
Negative feedback keeps the concentration of a hormone within a narrow range.
Negative feedback occurs when a product feeds back to decrease its own production.
