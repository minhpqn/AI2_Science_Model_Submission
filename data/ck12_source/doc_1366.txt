The pyroclasts cool in the atmosphere.
Some ash may stay in the atmosphere for years.
The ash may block out sunlight.
This changes weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth.
For a year or two after a large eruption, sunsets may be especially beautiful worldwide.
Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds.
The poisonous gases may be toxic close to the eruption.
The gases may cause environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction.
Mt.
St.
Helens
In 1980, Mount St.
Helens, located between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington, erupted explosively.
The eruption killed 57 people, destroyed 250 homes, and swept away 47 bridges.
The volcano blew off its top so that it lost over 400 meters (1,300 feet) of height.
Mt.
St.
