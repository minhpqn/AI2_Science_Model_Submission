Then answer the questions below.
How is air pressure related to the sublimation of solids?
Other than on Earth, name two places in the solar system where sublimation occurs.
At normal sea level pressure on Earth, at what temperature does solid carbon dioxide sublimate?
What is sublimation?
Give an example.
Describe conditions under which snow or ice is most likely to undergo sublimation.
The plastic container pictured in the Figure below is filled with solid air freshener.
The solid gradually shrinks after the holes in the top of the container are opened.
Explain why this occurs.
Solid air freshener
Define the change of state called deposition
Describe examples of deposition in nature.
The leaf-like pattern on the glass pictured here is as beautiful as any work of art.
It formed on a windowpane on a very cold winter night.
Do you know how it formed?
The answer is deposition.
What Is Deposition?
Deposition refers to the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state.
For example, when warm moist air inside a house comes into contact with a freezing cold windowpane, water vapor in the air changes to tiny ice crystals.
