The Second Group
Barium (Ba) is one of six elements in group 2 of the periodic table, which is shown below.
Elements in this group are called alkaline Earth metals .
These metals are silver or gray in color.
They are relatively soft and low in density, although not as soft and lightweight as alkali metals.

Reactivity of Alkaline Earth Metals
All alkaline Earth metals have similar properties because they all have two valence electrons.
They readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
As a result, they are very reactive, although not quite as reactive as the alkali metals in group 1.
For example, alkaline Earth metals will react with cold water, but not explosively as alkali metals do.
Because of their reactivity, alkaline Earth metals never exist as pure substances in nature.
Instead, they are always found combined with other elements.
The reactivity of alkaline Earth metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group.
Thatâ€™s because the atoms get bigger from the top to the bottom, so the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus.
When valence electrons are farther from the nucleus, they are attracted less strongly by the nucleus and more easily removed from the atom.
This makes the atom more reactive.
Q:
Alkali metals have just one valence electron.
