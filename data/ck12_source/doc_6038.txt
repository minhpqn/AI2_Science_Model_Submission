What might your weather prediction be?
Define atmospheric pressure.
What is an aneroid barometer?
How does the atmospheric pressure change as the altitude increases?
aneroid barometer:
Measures pressure by the expansion and contraction of a small spring within an evacuated metal capsule.
atmospheric pressure:
The pressure exerted by gas particles in Earth’s atmosphere as those particles collide with objects.
barometer:
Measures atmospheric pressure.
Pressure Units and Conversions
Be able to convert between different units of pressure.
Maintaining higher tire pressure can extend the lifetime of a car
Can you guess how old this car is?
There are several benefits to maintaining the proper air pressure in a car tire.
The ride is smoother and safer than with lowered pressure.
The car gets better gas mileage and the tires don’t wear out as fast.
The recommended pressure for that model of car (usually somewhere between 32-35 psi) is usually listed in the owner’s manual or stamped somewhere inside the door.
The pressure on the tire is the maximum pressure for that tire, not the recommended one.
Tire pressure is best measured when the tire is cold since driving the car for a while will heat up the air in the tire and increase the pressure.
