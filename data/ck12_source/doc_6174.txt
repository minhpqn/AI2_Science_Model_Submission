Diluted muriatic acid (HCl) is used to clean concrete
How do you clean concrete?
Muriatic acid (another name for HCl) is widely used for cleaning concrete and masonry surfaces.
The acid must be diluted before use to get it down to a safer strength.
Commercially available at concentrations of about 18%, this compound can be used to remove scales and deposits (usually composed of basic materials).
When additional water is added to an aqueous solution, the concentration of that solution decreases.
This is because the number of moles of the solute does not change, while the volume of the solution increases.
We can set up an equality between the moles of the solute before the dilution (1) and the moles of the solute after the dilution (2).
Since the moles of solute in a solution is equal to the molarity multiplied by the liters, we can set those equal.
