High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.
Humidity usually refers to relative humidity .
This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold.
How much water vapor can the air hold?
That depends on temperature.
Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air ( Figure below ).

How much water vapor can the air hold when its temperature is 40° C?
Humidity and Heat
People often say, “it’s not the heat but the humidity.” Humidity can make a hot day feel even hotter.
When sweat evaporates, it cools your body.
But sweat can’t evaporate when the air already contains as much water vapor as it can hold.
The heat index ( Figure below ) is a measure of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity.

How hot does it feel when the air temperature is 90°F?
It depends on the humidity.
You’ve probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning.
Why does dew form?
Remember that the land heats up and cools down fairly readily.
So when night comes, the land cools.
