The radius of the loop is 40 \;\mathrm{m} .
If the height at point G is 76 m, then how fast is the coaster going at point G?
Does the coaster actually make it through the loop without falling? (Hint:
You might review the material from centripetal motion lessons to answer this part.)

Energy and Momentum Problems
Solve problems involving both energy and momentum conservation.
Students will learn how to solve problems involving both energy and momentum conservation and where one is allowed to use either momentum conservation or energy conservation or both.
\sum E_{\text{initial}} = \sum E_{\text{final}} ;
The total energy does not change in closed systems
\sum p_{\text{initial}} = \sum p_{\text{final}} ;
The total momentum does not change in closed systems
Guidance When attacking these problems remember that in a collision, energy is transferred out of the system to the environment, via heat, sound, breaking of molecular bonds, etc.
