With water bulging on two sides of Earth, there’s less water left in between.
This creates low tides on the other two sides of the planet.
Diagram of how the moon causes tides
High and low tides are due mainly to the pull of the Moon’s gravity.
Spring Tides and Neap Tides
The Sun’s gravity also pulls on Earth and its oceans.
The Sun is much larger than the Moon, so is its pull greater than the Moon’s?
The pull of the Sun’s gravity is much less because the Sun is much farther away.
The Sun’s gravity strengthens or weakens the Moon’s influence on tides.
The figure below shows where the Moon is relative to the Sun at different times during the month ( Figure below ).
The positions of the Moon and Sun relative to each other affects the tides.
This creates spring tides or neap tides.
Spring tides occur during the new moon and full moon.
The Sun and Moon must either be in a straight line on the same side of Earth, or they must be on opposite sides of Earth.
Their gravitational pull combines to cause very high and very low tides.
Spring tides have the greatest tidal range.
Neap tides occur during the first and third quarters of the Moon.
The Moon and Sun are at right angles to each other.
Their gravity pulls on the oceans in different directions so the highs and lows are not as great.
Neap tides have the smallest tidal range.
