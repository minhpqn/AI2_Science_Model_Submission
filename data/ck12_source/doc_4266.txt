Radial symmetry evolved first.
This was followed by bilateral symmetry.
How do the two types of symmetry differ?
The coral polyp in Figure above has radial symmetry.
This was the first type of symmetry to evolve.
The coral has a distinct top and bottom but not distinct ends.
It can be divided into identical halves like a pie, but not into right and left halves.
Animals with radial symmetry have no sense of directions such as forward and backward or left and right.
This makes controlled movement in these directions impossible.
Flatworms represent the next stage of invertebrate evolution.
They evolved cephalization.
This is the concentration of nerve tissue at one end of the body, forming a head region.
This is highly adaptive.
It allows central control of the entire organism.
Cephalization was first step in the evolution of a brain.
An outcome of cephalization was bilateral symmetry.
This is demonstrated by the beetle in Figure above .
With concentrated nerve tissue at the head but not at the tail end, the two ends of the body are distinct from each other.
The animal can be divided down the middle to form identical right and left halves.
It allows the animal to tell front from back and left from right.
