The process of making mRNA from the information in the DNA (gene) sequence.
transcription factor :
A protein involved in regulating gene expression; usually bound to a cis-regulatory element on the DNA; also known as a regulatory protein or a trans-acting factor.
Transcription is the transfer of the genetic instructions from DNA to RNA.
Transcription begins with the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter of a gene.
