What bird would eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar?
Draw a sketch of a hypothetical bird that preys on small mammals.
The bird must exhibit traits that suit it for its predatory role.
Describe the two main characteristics of mammals.
List additional characteristics of mammals.
One of these is not a mammal.
Which one?
Mammals are a class of endothermic vertebrates.
They have four limbs and produce amniotic eggs.
Examples of mammals include bats, whales, mice, and humans.
Clearly, mammals are a very diverse group.
Nonetheless, they share many traits that set them apart from other vertebrates.
Characteristics of Mammals
Two characteristics are used to define the mammal class.
They are mammary glands and body hair (or fur).
Female mammals have mammary glands .
The glands produce milk after the birth of offspring.
Milk is a nutritious fluid.
It contains disease-fighting molecules as well as all the nutrients a baby mammal needs.
Producing milk for offspring is called lactation .
