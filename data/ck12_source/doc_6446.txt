oxidation-reduction reaction:
A reaction that involves the full or partial transfer of electrons from one reactant to another.
redox reaction:
Another term for an oxidation-reduction reaction.
reduction:
The full or partial gain of electrons or the loss of oxygen.
Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
Define oxidizing agent.
Define reducing agent.
Identify oxidizing and reducing agents in a redox reaction.
Plants are the primary source of the oxygen we breath
Where do we get oxygen for breathing?
Life on planet Earth is a complicated and well-organized set of processes.
Animals are designed to breathe oxygen and plants are designed to produce oxygen.
Photosynthesis is the means by which we get the oxygen we need for life.
Light striking a plant pigment known as chlorophyll initiates a complex series of reactions, many of which involve redox processes complete with movement of electrons.
In this series of reactions, water is converted to oxygen gas, and we have something to sustain our lives.
