Smokestacks polluting the atmosphere
Air pollution comes from many sources, including waste expelled into the atmosphere by numerous factories.
Earthâ€™s atmosphere is vast.
However, it has been seriously polluted by human activities.
Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released into the atmosphere, mainly by human actions.
The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels.
Power plants, motor vehicles, and home furnaces all burn fossil fuels and contribute to the problem (see Table below ).
Ranching and using chemicals such as fertilizers also cause air pollution.
Erosion of soil in farm fields and construction sites adds dust particles to the air as well.
Fumes from building materials, furniture, carpets, and paint add toxic chemicals to indoor air.
