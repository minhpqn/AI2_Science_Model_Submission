Hydrogen has three isotopes.
^1_1 \text{H} \qquad ^2_1 \text{H} \qquad ^3_1 \text{H}
One isotope of hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 1.
Another isotope of hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 2.
The third isotope of hydrogen has 1 proton and 2 neutrons in the nucleus so it has a mass number of 3. (The isotope of hydrogen with a mass number of 2 is sometimes called deuterium and the isotope of hydrogen with a mass number of 3 is sometimes called tritium, but they are all hydrogen.) Carbon has six isotopes; carbon-11, carbon-12, carbon-13, carbon-14, carbon-15, and carbon-16.
The isotopes of a given element are not all equally abundant.
For example, 98.9% of all naturally occurring carbon is carbon-12 and about 1.1% is carbon-13.
The other isotopes of carbon are even less abundant.
The periodic table is a complete listing of all the known elements.
Each element has its own square in the periodic table.
The square contains the chemical symbol for the element, the atomic number, and the atomic weight .
The atomic weight of an element is a weighted average of its isotopes.
The element boron consists of two isotopes, boron-10 and boron-11.
The abundance of boron-10 is 20.0% and the abundance of boron-11 is 80.0%.
What is the atomic weight of boron?
\text{Atomic weight} = (0.20)(10.0 \text{ amu}) + (0.80)(11.0 \text{ amu}) = 2.0 + 8.8 = 10.8 \text{ amu}
Since the identification of the neutron, the model of the atomic nucleus has changed very little.
According to this model, a nucleus is considered to be an aggregate of protons and neutrons.
The number of protons in a nucleus is called the atomic number and is designated by the symbol Z .
The total number of nucleons, neutrons and protons, is designated by the symbol  A and is called the mass number.
