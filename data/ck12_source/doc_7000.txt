How would you need to manipulate this data in order to create a linear plot?
In a real experiment what could cause the data to deviate from the expected values?
Explain.
What safety considerations are important for this experiment?
Explain how you could use a diffraction grating to calculate the unknown wavelength of another laser.
Distance of diffraction grating to screen (cm)
Distance from central maximum to first order peak (cm)
A crystal of silicon has atoms spaced 54.2 \;\mathrm{nm} apart.
It is analyzed as if it were a diffraction grating using an x- ray of wavelength 12 \;\mathrm{nm} .
Calculate the angular separation between the first and second order peaks from the central maximum.
Laser light shines on an oil film (n = 1.43) sitting on water.
At a point where the film is 96 \;\mathrm{nm} thick, a 1^{st} order dark fringe is observed.
What is the wavelength of the laser?
You want to design an experiment in which you use the properties of thin film interference to investigate the variations in thickness of a film of water on glass.
List all the necessary lab equipment you will need.
Carefully explain the procedure of the experiment and draw a diagram.
List the equations you will use and do a sample calculation using realistic numbers.
Explain what would be the most significant errors in the experiment and what effect they would have on the data.
