Their attachment is random, so all of the chromosomes from the mother or father do not end up in the same gamete.
The gamete will contain some chromosomes from the mother and some chromosomes from the father.
Anaphase I:
The homologous chromosomes are separated as the spindle shortens, and begin to move to opposite sides (opposite poles) of the cell.
Telophase I:
The spindle fibers dissolves, but a new nuclear envelope does not need to form.
This is because, after cytokinesis, the nucleus will immediately begin to divide again.
No DNA replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II because the chromosomes are already duplicated.
After cytokinesis, two haploid cells result, each with chromosomes made of sister chromatids.
Since the separation of chromosomes into gametes is random during meiosis I, this process results in different combinations of chromosomes (and alleles) in each gamete.
With 23 pairs of chromosomes, there is a possibility of over 8 million different combinations of chromosomes (2 23 ) in a human gamete.
Diagram of crossing-over
During crossing-over, segments of DNA are exchanged between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.
Notice how this can result in an allele (A) on one chromatid being moved onto the other non-sister chromatid.
During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes are generated.
This cell division is similar to that of mitosis , but results in four genetically unique haploid cells.
The steps are outlined below:
Prophase II:
The chromosomes condense.
Metaphase II:
