Water becomes more dense when it is colder and when it has more salt.
In the North Atlantic Ocean, cold winds chill the water at the surface.
Sea ice grows in this cold water, but ice is created from fresh water.
The salt is left behind in the seawater.
This cold, salty water is very dense, so it sinks to the bottom of the North Atlantic.
Downwelling can take place in other places where surface water becomes very dense ( Figure below ).
Deep currents flow because of differences in density of ocean water
Deep currents flow because of differences in density of ocean water.
When water sinks it pushes deep water along at the bottom of the ocean.
This water circulates through all of the ocean basins in deep currents.
Sometimes deep ocean water rises to the surface.
This is called upwelling .
The figure below shows why it happens ( Figure below ).
Strong winds blow surface water away from shore.
This allows deeper water to flow to the surface and take its place.
Diagram of upwelling
An upwelling occurs when deep ocean water rises to the surface.
When water comes up from the deep, it brings a lot of nutrients with it.
Why is deep water so full of nutrients?
Over time, dead organisms and other organic matter settle to the bottom water and collect.
