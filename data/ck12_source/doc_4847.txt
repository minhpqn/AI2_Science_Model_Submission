The cells of a multicellular organism also perform these functions, but they may do so in collaboration with other cells.
Cells are essentially carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids in a water-based environment.
It is the lipid (phospholipid) membrane that keeps the water-based environment in the cell separate from the water-based environment outside the cell.
But a cell, even the single cell of a unicellular organism, must be able to interact with its external environment.
The cell must be able to bring molecules in from the outside, and expel unwanted waste products.
Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is necessary to all of the biological sciences.
Learning about the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell biology and molecular biology.
Cell biology is the field of biology that studies cells.
In particular, cell biologists study a cell's physiological properties, structure, organelles , interactions with the extracellular environment, life cycle, division and death.
Molecular biology concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the relationships between DNA, RNA and proteins.
Research in cell biology is closely linked to molecular biology, as well as genetics, biochemistry and developmental biology.
The importance of the similarities and differences between cell types is a unifying theme in biology.
They allow the principles learned from studying one cell type to be applied when learning about other cell types.
For example, learning about how single-celled bacteria function can help us understand more about how human cells function.
Understanding basic cellular processes, such as cell division or metabolism in bacteria, gives information about similar processes in our cells.
