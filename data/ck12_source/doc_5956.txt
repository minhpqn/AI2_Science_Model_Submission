Think about your result.
In a multi-step problem, be sure that the units check.
Conversions between moles and volume of a gas are shown.
Work the practice problems at the link below.
Focus on conversions between volume and moles, but try some of the others:
Why do the gases need to be at STP?
When does the identity of the gas become important?
Make calculations dealing with molar mass and density of a gas.
Carbon dioxide sinks in air
Why does carbon dioxide sink in air?
When we run a reaction to produce a gas, we expect it to rise into the air.  Many students have done experiments where gases such as hydrogen are formed.  The gas can be trapped in a test tube held upside-down over the reaction.  Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, sinks when it is released.  Carbon dioxide has a density greater that air, so it will not rise like these other gases would.
As you know, density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance.  Since gases all occupy the same volume on a per mole basis, the density of a particular gas is dependent on its molar mass.  A gas with a small molar mass will have a lower density than a gas with a large molar mass.  Gas densities are typically reported in g/L.  Gas density can be calculated from molar mass and molar volume.
Balloons float because they contain helium, which is lighter than air
Balloons filled with helium gas float in air because the density of helium is less than the density of air.
Sample Problem One:
Gas Density
What is the density of nitrogen gas at STP?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
N 2 = 28.02 g/mol
