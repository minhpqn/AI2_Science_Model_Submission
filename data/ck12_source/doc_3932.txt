These are important questions that do not have an easy answer.
But as our population continues to grow, these questions and others should be discussed.
Recent Population Growth
At one time, scientists predicted that all human populations would pass through the same demographic transition as Europe and North America.
Now, they are not so sure.
Death rates have fallen throughout the world.
No country today remains in Stage 1 of the transition.
However, birth rates are still high in many poor countries.
These populations seem to be stuck in Stage 2.
An example is the African country of Angola.
Its population pyramid for 2005 is shown in Figure below .
The wide base of the pyramid base reflects the high birth rate of this population.
Angola's population pyramid is typical of Stage 2 demographic transition
Angolaâ€™s population pyramid is typical of Stage 2 of the demographic transition.
Many other countries have shifted to Stage 3 of the transition.
Birth rates have started to fall.
As a result, population growth is slowing.
An example is Mexico.
Its population pyramid for 1998 is shown in Figure below .
It reflects a recent fall in the birth rate.
