Two representatives of more than fifty modern animal phyla from the Cambrian explosion are reef-building sponges (left) and early arthropods known as trilobites (right).
Both were abundant during the Cambrian and later became extinct; however, the phyla they represent persist to this day.
The Ordovician Period :
During the next period, the Ordovician Period (505–440 million years ago), the oceans became filled with invertebrates of many types.
Also during this period, the first fish evolved and plants colonized the land for the first time.
But animals still remained in the water.
The Silurian Period :
During the Silurian Period (440–410 million years ago), corals appeared in the oceans, and fish continued to evolve.
On land, vascular plants appeared.
With special tissues to circulate water and other materials, these plants could grow larger than the earlier nonvascular plants.
And early vascular plant, Cooksonia
Cooksonia , a branching vascular plant with sporangia at the tips of each branch.
Cooksonia fossils measure just centimeters in height and date from the Silurian period.
The Devonian Period :
During the Devonian Period (410–360 million years ago), the first seed plants evolved.
Seeds have a protective coat and stored food to help these plants survive.
Seed plants eventually became the most common type of land plants.
In the oceans, fish with lobe fins evolved.
They could breathe air when they raised their heads above water.
Breathing would be necessary for animals to eventually colonize the land.
