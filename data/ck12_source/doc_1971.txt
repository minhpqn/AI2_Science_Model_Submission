How do identical twins, who should have exactly the same sets of genes (genome) end up with differences?
How are genomes changed and passed on to offspring so that the offspring aren't genetically identical to one or the other parent?
Why are some deer mice brown and some lighter colored in Nebraska?
Using the example of the deer mice, how does natural selection explain the change with time of darker mice into lighter mice?
How does biological evolution work?
Describe the factors that regulate population size.
How many geese are the right number for this area?
As many as can survive and have healthy offspring!
The figure above shows a flock of snow geese at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.
Their population will tend to grow as big as it can for the resources it needs.
Once it is too large, some of its members will die off.
This keeps the population size at the right number.
How Populations Grow
A population usually grows when it has what it needs.
If thereâ€™s plenty of food and other resources, the population will get bigger.
Refer to the table below ( Table below ); it shows how a population of bacteria grew.
A single bacteria cell was added to a container of nutrients.
