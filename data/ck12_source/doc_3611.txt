During mitosis , when the nucleus divides, the two chromatids that make up each chromosome separate from each other and move to opposite poles of the cell.
This is shown in Figure below .
You can watch an animation of the process at the following link:
Process of mitosis
Mitosis is the phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle that occurs between DNA replication and the formation of two daughter cells.
What happens during mitosis?
Mitosis actually occurs in four phases.
The phases are called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
They are shown in Figure below and described in greater detail in the following sections.
Mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle
Mitosis in the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle.
Mitosis is the multi-phase process in which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides.
The first and longest phase of mitosis is prophase .
During prophase, chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and the nuclear envelope, or membrane, breaks down.
In animal cells, the centrioles near the nucleus begin to separate and move to opposite poles (sides) of the cell.
As the centrioles move, a spindle starts to form between them.
The spindle, shown in Figure below , consists of fibers made of microtubules.

The spindle starts to form during prophase of mitosis.
