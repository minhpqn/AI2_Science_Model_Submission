An example of a solution in which water is the solvent is salt water.
In this solution, a solid—sodium chloride—is the solute.
In addition to a solid dissolved in a liquid, solutions can also form with solutes and solvents in other states of matter.
Examples are given in the Table below .
Solutions and Three States of Matter
Oxygen and other gases in nitrogen (air)
Carbon dioxide in water (carbonated water)
Ethanol (an alcohol) in water
Sodium chloride in water (salt water)
Hydrogen gas in metals
Mercury in silver and other metals (dental fillings)
Iron in carbon (steel)
The ability of a solute to dissolve in a particular solvent is called solubility .
Many chemical substances are soluble in water.
In fact, so many substances are soluble in water that water is called the universal solvent.
Water is a strongly polar solvent, and polar solvents are better at dissolving polar solutes.
Many organic compounds and other important biochemicals are polar, so they dissolve well in water.
On the other hand, strongly polar solvents like water cannot dissolve strongly nonpolar solutes like oil.
Did you ever try to mix oil and water?
Even after being well shaken, the two substances quickly separate into distinct layers.
