The Atmosphere and Earth’s Temperature
Gases in the atmosphere surround Earth like a blanket.
They keep the temperature in a range that can support life.
The gases keep out some of the Sun’s scorching heat during the day.
At night, they hold the heat close to the surface, so it doesn’t radiate out into space.
The Atmosphere and Earth’s Water
The image below shows the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle ( Figure below ).
Water vapor rises from Earth’s surface into the atmosphere.
As it rises, it cools.
The water vapor may then condense into water droplets and form clouds.
If enough water droplets collect in clouds, they may come together to form droplets.
The droplets will fall as rain.
This how freshwater gets from the atmosphere back to Earth's surface.
The atmosphere is a big part of the water cycle

What do you think would happen to Earth’s water without it?
The Atmosphere and Weather
Without the atmosphere, there would be no clouds or rain.
In fact, there would be no weather at all.
Most weather occurs because the atmosphere heats up more in some places than others.
