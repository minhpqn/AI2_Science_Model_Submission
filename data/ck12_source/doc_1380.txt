Is this a supervolcano?
Lake Toba in Indonesia is 100 km (62 mi) by 30 km (19 mi).
The water fills a giant caldera created by a supervolcano.
The eruption took place about 75,000 years ago, Earth's largest eruption in the past 25 million years.
So much material was ejected into space that there was a 6- to 10-year volcanic winter.
Some scientists think that only 10,000 humans survived worldwide.
The numbers of other mammals also plummeted.
During a massive eruption, all of the material may be ejected from a magma changer.
Without support, the mountain above the empty chamber may collapse.
This produces a huge caldera .
Calderas are generally round, bowl-shaped formations ( Figure below ).
Map of Crater Lake, created by a caldera
Crater Lake, Oregon is the remnant of Mount Mazama.
After an enormous eruption the mountain collapsed, forming a caldera.
Crater Lake should actually be named Caldera Lake.
Wizard Island, within the lake, is a cinder cone.
Supervolcano eruptions are extremely rare in Earth's history.
Itâ€™s a good thing because they are unimaginably large.
A supervolcano must erupt more than 1,000 cubic km (240 cubic miles) of material.
Imagine how large that is compared with 1.2 km 3 for Mount St.
