Nuclear fusion reactions in the laboratory have been extraordinarily difficult to achieve.
Extremely high temperatures (in the millions of degrees) are required.
Methods must be developed to force the atoms together and hold them together long enough to react.
The neutrons released during the fusion reactions can interact with atoms in the reactor and convert them to radioactive materials.
There has been some success in the field of nuclear fusion reactions, but the journey to feasible fusion power is still a long and uncertain one.
The process of nuclear fusion is described.
Examples of nuclear fusion reactions are given.
