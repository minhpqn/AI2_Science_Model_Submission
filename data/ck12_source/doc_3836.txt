The resulting faster offspring will be even more difficult for the wolves to catch, and only the fastest wolves - or perhaps the wolves who are genetically capable of developing methods to hunt very fast prey - will get enough food to survive.
This is coevolution in action.
Evolution occurs in response to a change in the environment.
Environmental change often involves other species of organisms.
In fact, species in symbiotic relationships tend to evolve together.
This is called coevolution .
As one species changes, the other species must also change in order to adapt.
Coevolution occurs in flowering plants and the species that pollinate them.
The flower and bird in Figure below are a good example.
They have evolved matching structures.
Coevolution of a hummingbird and a flower
Results of Coevolution in a Flower and Its Pollinator.
The very long mouth part of this hummingbird has coevolved with the tubular flower it pollinates.
Only this species of bird can reach the nectar deep in the flower.
What might happen to the flower if the bird species went extinct?
In coevolution, relationships may be positive for one species or both, or may be an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey.
Flowering plants depend on insects for pollination, so have evolved colors, shapes, scents, and even food supplies that are attractive to certain insect species.
Insects, in turn, have evolved mouthparts, senses, and flight patterns that allow them to respond to and benefit from specific floral “offerings,” shown in the Figure below .
Coevolution of hawk moths and zinnea flowers
Impressive proboscis and vivid colors!
