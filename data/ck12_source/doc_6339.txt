Reactions such as these are said to go to completion.
These processes are often referred to as non-reversible reactions .
Reactions which go to completion tend to produce one of three types of products: (1) an insoluble precipitate, (2) a gas, (3) a molecular compound such as water.
Examples of these reactions are shown below.
Formation of a precipitate
\text{AgNO}_3(aq)+\text{NaCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaNO}_3(aq)+\text{AgCl}(s)
Formation of a gas
\text{Mg}(s)+2\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{MgCl}_2(aq)+\text{H}_2(g)
Formation of water
\text{HCl}(aq)+\text{NaOH}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
If we look at these reactions in more detail, we can see some things that are not apparent the way the equations are written.
Looking at the first equation, we do not see a double arrow between reactants and products because the reaction is considered essentially irreversible.
However if we consider the net ionic equation \text{Ag}^+ +\text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{AgCl} , then the reverse reaction would be \text{AgCl} \rightarrow \text{Ag}^+ + \text{Cl}^- .
The  K_{eq} for the reverse reaction is 1.8 Ã— 10 -10 .
For all practical purposes, the reaction goes to completion.
Formation of a gas in an open system is essentially irreversible since the gas escapes into the atmosphere.
Looking at the activity series we see that Mg is much higher in the series than hydrogen.
So the reaction would be expected to go strongly in the indicated direction.
The third reaction gets a little more complicated.
In solution, the reactants HCl and NaOH will be ionize completely as does the NaCl product.
