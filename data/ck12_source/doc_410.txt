Important Arteries and Veins
There are specific veins and arteries that are more significant than others.
The pulmonary arteries carry oxygen-poor blood away from the heart to the lungs.
These are the only arteries that carry oxygen-poor blood.
The aorta is the largest artery in the body.
It carries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart.
Further away from the heart, the aorta branches into smaller arteries, which eventually branch into capillaries.
Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessel; they connect very small arteries and veins.
Gases and other substances are exchanged between cells and the blood across the very thin walls of capillaries.
The veins that return oxygen-poor blood to the heart are the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava .
The pulmonary veins return oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart.
The pulmonary veins are the only veins that carry oxygen-rich blood.
Pulmonary circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen-poor blood away from the heart and brings it to the lungs.
Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart from the body and leaves the right ventricle through the pulmonary arteries, which carry the blood to each lung.
Once at the lungs, the red blood cells release carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen when you breathe.
The oxygen-rich blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins, which return it to the left side of the heart.
This completes the pulmonary cycle.
The oxygenated blood is then pumped to the body through systemic circulation, before returning again to pulmonary circulation.
Systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart, to the body, and returns oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.
Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left ventricle through the aorta.
