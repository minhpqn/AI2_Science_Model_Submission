It is a Gingko tree, which is an unique species in that there are no close living relatives.
Gingkoes can live for a very long time.
Some specimens of this species are thought to be over 2,500 years old.
The Ginkgo is also known as a living fossil, with fossils related to modern Ginkgo from the Permian period, dating back 270 million years.
Seed plants are called spermatophytes .
The evolution of seeds by vascular plants was a very big deal.
In fact, it was arguably as important as the evolution of vascular tissues.
Seeds solved the problem of releasing offspring into a dry world.
Once seeds evolved, vascular seed plants and their descendants diversified to fill terrestrial niches everywhere.
Today, vascular seed plants dominate Earth.
Parts of a Seed
As shown in Figure below , a seed consists of at least three basic parts: the embryo, seed coat, and stored food.
The embryo develops from a fertilized egg.
While still inside the seed, the embryo forms its first leaf (cotyledon) and starts to develop a stem (hypocotyl) and root (radicle).
The tough seed coat protects the embryo and keeps it from drying out until conditions are favorable for germination.
The stored food in a seed is called endosperm .
It nourishes the embryo until it can start making food on its own.
Parts of a seed
A typical plant seed, like this avocado seed, contains an embryo, seed coat, and endosperm.
How does each part contribute to the successful development of the new plant?
