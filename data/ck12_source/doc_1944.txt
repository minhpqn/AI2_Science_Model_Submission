Toward the very end of this time, humans have evolved.
We are now witness to the geology of the Cenozoic.
What came earlier in this era looks a lot like what is going on now.
The Cenozoic began around 65.5 million years ago.
We say that it begins after the Cretaceous extinction.
We are still in the Cenozoic today.
The Cenozoic accounts for only about 1.5% of Earthâ€™s total history.
But since it's the the most recent era, it is the one we know the most about.
Much of what has been discussed elsewhere in this text describes the geology of the Cenozoic.
A few highlights are mentioned here.
The plate tectonics of the Cenozoic are still going on today.
Early in the Cenozoic, blocks of crust uplifted to form the Rocky Mountains.
Subduction off of the Pacific Northwest formed the Cascades volcanic arc.
Crust is being pulled apart to form the Basin and Range province that centers on Nevada.
Evolution of the San Andreas Fault
The San Andreas Fault is where the Pacific and North American plates meet ( Figure below ).
How did the San Andreas Fault form?
The Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American Plate.
This began about 30 million years ago.
By 20 million years ago, the Pacific Plate and East Pacific Rise spreading center had started to subduct.
