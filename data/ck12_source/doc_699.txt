Locate the image for an object distance of 40.0 cm.
Indicate whether the image is real or virtual, enlarged or diminished, and upright or inverted.
A dentist uses a concave mirror to examine a tooth that is 1.00 cm in front of the mirror.
The image of the tooth forms 10.0 cm behind the mirror.
What is the mirrorâ€™s radius of curvature?
What is the magnification of the image?
When a man stands 1.52 m in front of a shaving mirror, the image produced is inverted and has an image distance of 18.0 cm.
How close to the mirror must the man place his face if he wants an upright image with a magnification of 2.0?
concave mirror:
Composed of a reflective surface with its sides curved closer in distance to your eye than its middle surface.
convex mirror:
Composed of a reflective surface with its middle surface closer in distance to your eye than its edges.
spherical mirror:
It is a part of a hollow sphere, whose one side is reflecting and other side is opaque.
focal point:
The point on the principal axis of a mirror to which parallel rays of light converge after reflection.
spherical aberration:
Spherical mirrors have a defect that prohibits the mirror from focusing all the incident light from the same location on an object to a precise point.
Rays that strike the outer edges of the mirror fail to focus in the same precise location as light rays that strike the inner portions of the mirror.
The result is that the images of objects as seen in spherical mirrors are often blurry.
