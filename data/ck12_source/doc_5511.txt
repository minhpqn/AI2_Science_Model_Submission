How does soap relate to chemistry?
Chemistry affects every area of our lives.
Here is just one example of chemistry in action – the making of soaps.
Soap was once made by boiling animal fat in ashes – the product was hard on the skin and not very pleasant to use.
Today, soap manufacture involves complicated chemical processes to provide a wide variety of soaps for different skin types.
Colors and odors can be custom-made for that individual experience.
What is this made of?
How can we produce this material quicker and at lower cost?
Will this product harm us or help us?
All of these questions can be answered using the science of chemistry .
What Is Chemistry?
If we look up the word “chemistry” in the dictionary, we’ll find something like this: “The science of the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter , especially of atomic and molecular systems” (Free Online Dictionary).
This definition is certainly accurate, but does not give a good picture of the scope of chemistry or of the many interesting aspects of the field.
Chemistry touches every area of our lives.
The medicines we take, the food we eat, the clothes we wear – all these materials and more are, in some way or another, products of chemistry.
