Kevlar:
A material now widely used in body armor.
Also, has found wide application in racing sails, car tires, brakes, and fire-resistant clothing worn by firefighters.
liquid crystal:
Used in electronic displays, as in watches and calculators.
nylon:  Human-made fabric.
Material is made from hydrocarbons found in petroleum products.
It is found in a number of plastic utensils.
Taking advantages of its strength and light weight, nylon is a component of ropes, fishing nets, tents, and parachutes.
superconductor:
