Refraction occurs when waves bend as they enter a new medium at an angle.
You can see an example of refraction in the Figure below .
Light bends when it passes from air to water or from water to air.
The bending of the light traveling from the fish to the man’s eyes causes the fish to appear to be in a different place from where it actually is.
Diagram illustrating refraction
Waves bend as they enter a new medium because they start traveling at a different speed in the new medium.
For example, light travels more slowly in water than in air.
This causes it to refract when it passes from air to water or from water to air.
Q:
Where would the fish appear to be if the man looked down at it from straight above its actual location?
A:
The fish would appear to be where it actually is because refraction occurs only when waves (in this case light waves from the fish) enter a new medium at an angle other than 90°.
Did you ever notice that you can hear sounds around the corners of buildings even though you can’t see around them?
The Figure below shows why this happens.
As you can see from the figure, sound waves spread out and travel around obstacles.
This is called diffraction .
It also occurs when waves pass through an opening in an obstacle.
All waves may be diffracted, but it is more pronounced in some types of waves than others.
For example, sound waves bend around corners much more than light does.
That’s why you can hear but not see around corners.
