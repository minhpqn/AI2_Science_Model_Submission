The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other cells in the body.
These cells are haploid, with a single set of chromosomes.
This is because when they combine together, they form a cell with the full number of chromosomes.
The cell they form is called a zygote .
The zygote is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent.
A human zygote has two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).
The zygote slowly travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus.
As it travels, it divides by mitosis many times.
It forms a hollow ball of cells.
After the ball of cells reaches the uterus, it fixes itself to the side of the uterus.
This is called implantation .
It usually happens about a week after fertilization.
Now the implanted ball of cells is ready to continue its development into a baby boy or girl.
Fertilization occurs when an egg and sperm come together to form a zygote.
Implantation occurs when the developing embryo fixes itself to the side of the uterus.
