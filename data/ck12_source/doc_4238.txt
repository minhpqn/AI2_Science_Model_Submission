Intelligence and Innate Behavior
Innate behaviors occur in all animals.
However, they are less common in species with higher levels of intelligence.
Humans are the most intelligent species, and they have very few innate behaviors.
The only innate behaviors in humans are reflexes.
A reflex is a response that always occurs when a certain stimulus is present.
For example, a human infant will grasp an object, such as a finger, that is placed in its palm.
The infant has no control over this reaction because it is innate.
Other than reflexes such as this, human behaviors are learned–or at least influenced by experience—rather than being innate.
Innate Behavior in Human Beings
All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings.
Can you think of human behaviors that do not have to be learned?
Chances are, you will have a hard time thinking of any.
The only truly innate behaviors in humans are called reflex behaviors .
They occur mainly in babies.
Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies may help them survive.
An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex.
Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth.
It is easy to see how this behavior evolved.
It increases the chances of a baby feeding and surviving.
