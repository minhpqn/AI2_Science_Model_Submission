mol SO 2 → mol O 2 → g O 2
Step 2:
Solve.
4.60 \text{ mol SO}_2 \times \frac{3 \text{ mol O}_2}{2 \text{ mol SO}_2} \times \frac{32.00 \text{ g O}_2}{1 \text{ mol O}_2}=221 \text{ g O}_2
Step 3:
Think about your result.
According to the mole ratio, 6.90 mol O 2 is produced with a mass of 221 g.
The answer has three significant figures because the given number of moles has three significant figures.
