Discuss the role of the three main types of RNA: mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA.
How does the information move from the nucleus, where the DNA is located, to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are?
RNA, the other nucleic acid, that's how.
Specifically mRNA or messenger RNA.
RNA, the middle player in the central dogma.
This image is an abstract representation of transfer RNA, which brings the amino acid to the ribosome.
Without tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA, proteins cannot be made.
Types of RNAs
So what is the role of?
We know that RNA is the middle player in the central dogma of molecular biology, but is that all it does?
There are three types of RNA involved in protein synthesis: messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribisomal RNA (rRNA).
All three of these nucleic acids work together to produce a protein.
The mRNA takes the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located.
Ribosomes are the organelles where the proteins are made.
The ribosomes themselves are made out of rRNA and other proteins.
The mRNA binds to the ribosome, bringing the genetic instructions to order the amino acids to the site of protein synthesis.
Finally, the tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome ( Figure below and Figure below ).
In mRNA, the four nucleotides (A, C, G, and U) are arranged into codons of three bases each.
Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except for the stop codons , which terminate protein synthesis. tRNA, which has a specific “3-leaf clover structure,” contains a three base region called the anticodon , which can base pair to the corresponding three-base codon region on mRNA.
More will be discussed on these processes in the Protein Synthesis:
