What do the dark areas in an X-ray image represent?
A:
The dark areas represent materials that do not absorb X-rays.
Instead, the X-rays pass through these areas.
For example, in the X-ray image pictured in the Figure above , the bag doesn't show up because X-rays pass through the soft cloth, but not the dense objects inside.
Dangers of X-Rays
Because X-rays are so energetic, they can penetrate many substances, including living cells.
Therefore, too much X-ray exposure can be dangerous.
It may damage cells and cause cancer.
If you’ve had dental X-rays, you may have noticed that a heavy apron was placed over your body to protect it from stray X-rays.
Protective aprons like this are made of lead, which X-rays can’t pass through.
Electromagnetic waves vary in their frequencies and wavelengths, and waves with higher frequencies have greater energy.
The electromagnetic spectrum represents the full range of frequencies of electromagnetic waves.
X-rays are high-frequency electromagnetic waves with more energy than any other electromagnetic waves except gamma rays.
X-rays are used to make images of bones and teeth inside the body and to see inside luggage at airports.
X-rays can penetrate the body, damage cells, and cause cancer.
