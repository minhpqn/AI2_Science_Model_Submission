What is radioactive decay?
Compare and contrast alpha, beta, and gamma decay.
Explain how and why alpha decay occurs.
Show how to write a balanced nuclear equation for alpha decay.
Describe the dangers of alpha decay.
You probably associate the term decay with images like the one above.
But when it comes to atoms, decay has a different meaning.
Decay in chemistry refers to changes in the nuclei of certain atoms.
Why Some Nuclei Decay
Radioactive elements and isotopes have unstable nuclei.
To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay.
In radioactive decay, the nuclei give off, or emit, radiation in the form of energy and often particles as well.
There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay.
Energy is emitted in all three types of decay, but only alpha and beta decay also emit particles.
What Is Alpha Decay?
Alpha decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many protons.
The Figure below shows what happens during alpha decay.
The nucleus emits an alpha particle and energy.
An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, which is actually a helium nucleus.
Losing the protons and neutrons makes the nucleus more stable.
