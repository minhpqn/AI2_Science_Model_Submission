Precipitation is also influenced by temperature.
Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air, so tropical areas receive more rainfall than other parts of the world.
Nearness to the ocean and mountain ranges may also influence the amount of precipitation an area receives.
This is explained in Figure below .
Evaporation of moisture is greatest where it is hot and sunny.
Therefore, cold climates with low precipitation may not be as dry as warm climates with the same amount of precipitation.
Moist air from the ocean rises up over the mountain range.
As the air rises, it cools and its water vapor condenses.
Precipitation falls on the windward side of the mountain range.
The air is dry when it reaches the leeward side of the mountain range, so there is little precipitation there.
This creates a “rain shadow.”

Climate and Plant Growth
Plants are the major producers in terrestrial biomes.
They have five basic needs: air, warmth, sunlight, water, and nutrients.
How well these needs are met in a given location depends on the growing season and soil quality, both of which are determined mainly by climate.
The growing season is the period of time each year when it is warm and wet enough for plants to grow.
The growing season may last all year in a hot, wet climate but just a few months in a cooler or drier climate.
Plants grow best in soil that contains plenty of nutrients and organic matter.
