Nonetheless, whether a living thing is a huge whale or a microscopic bacterium, it is capable of reproduction.
Keeping Things Constant
All living things are able to maintain a more-or-less constant internal environment.
They keep things relatively stable on the inside regardless of the conditions around them.
The process of maintaining a stable internal environment is called homeostasis .
Human beings, for example, maintain a stable internal body temperature.
If you go outside when the air temperature is below freezing, your body doesn’t freeze.
Instead, by shivering and other means, it maintains a stable internal temperature.
All living things—even the simplest life forms—have a complex chemistry.
Living things consist of large, complex molecules, and they also undergo many complicated chemical changes to stay alive.
Thousands (or more) of these chemical reactions occur in each cell at any given moment.
Metabolism is the accumulated total of all the biochemical reactions occurring in a cell or organism.
Complex chemistry is needed to carry out all the functions of life.
All forms of life are built of at least one cell.
A cell is the basic unit of the structure and function of living things.
Living things may appear very different from one another on the outside, but their cells are very similar.
Compare the human cells on the left in Figure below and onion cells on the right in Figure below .
How are they similar?
If you click on the animation titled Inside a Cell at the link below, you can look inside a cell and see its internal structures.
Humans and onions look very different, but when comparing the cells, you might notice some similarities
