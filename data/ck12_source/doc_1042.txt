A reasonably accurate climate model needs the most powerful computers.
Still, no computer has yet been developed that can work with the entire system.
So scientists create models that represent parts of the system.
Many scientists use computers to model complicated processes

Models Can be Used to Test Ideas
Scientists must test their ideas.
It's much easier to work with a model than with a whole system.
A scientist may want to understand how rising CO 2 levels will affect climate.
In this case, it will be easier to model a smaller portion of that system.
For example, the scientist may model how higher levels of CO 2 affect plant growth and the effect that will have on climate.
Models Can be Used to Make Predictions
Models can be used to predict the future.
The best ones take into account the most factors.
How do scientists know if a model will predict the future accurately?
One way is to use a time in the past as the starting point.
Then run the model to see if the model can accurately predict the present.
A model that can successfully predict the present is more likely to be better at predicting the future.
For example, climate models are very useful for trying to determine what types of changes we can expect as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises.
Models Have Limitations
