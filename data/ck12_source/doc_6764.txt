Assume the average mass of the shrapnel is 0.4 kg and that there are 200 pieces.
What is the average speed of one piece?
A 1500 kg car starts at rest and speeds up to 3.0 m/s.
What is the gain in kinetic energy?
We define efficiency as the ratio of output energy (in this case kinetic energy) to input energy.
If this carâ€™s efficiency is 0.30, how much input energy was provided by the gasoline?
If 0.15 gallons were used up in the process, what is the energy content of the gasoline in Joules per gallon?
An airplane with mass 200,000 \;\mathrm{kg} is traveling with a speed of 268 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
What is the kinetic energy of the plane at this speed?
A wind picks up, which causes the plane to lose 1.20 \times 10^8 \;\mathrm{J} per second.
How fast is the plane going after 25.0 seconds?
