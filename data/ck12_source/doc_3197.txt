So the answer to the riddle is both yes and no!
How Sound Waves Begin
All sound waves begin with vibrating matter.
Look at the first guitar string on the left in the Figure below .
Plucking the string makes it vibrate.
The diagram below the figure shows the wave generated by the vibrating string.
The moving string repeatedly pushes against the air particles next to it, which causes the air particles to vibrate.
The vibrations spread through the air in all directions away from the guitar string as longitudinal waves.
In longitudinal waves, particles of the medium vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction that the waves travel.

Q:
If there were no air particles to carry the vibrations away from the guitar string, how would sound reach the ear?
A:
It wouldnâ€™t unless the vibrations were carried by another medium.
Sound waves are mechanical waves, so they can travel only though matter and not through empty space.
A Ticking Clock
The fact that sound cannot travel through empty space was first demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle.
Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar.
The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar.
