How do we know?
What are supercontinents?
How do we know of their existence (think back to the concepts in the Plate Tectonics chapter)?
Why was plate tectonics faster in the early Earth?
Paleozoic Plate Tectonics
Describe how supercontinents come together.
Explain how mountain ranges are created by the process of orogeny.
Could these mountains have existed in the Paleozoic?
Sure!
There have been lots of huge mountain ranges in Earth history.
When continents collide, big mountains grow.
The formation of Pangaea created long large mountain ranges.
The mountains that formed then look a lot like the Himalayas do today.
The Paleozoic Era
The Paleozoic is the earliest era of the Phanerozoic.
The Paleozoic was also the longest era of the Phanerozoic.
But the Paleozoic was relatively recent.
It began only 570 million years ago.
At the start of the Paleozoic, there was a supercontinent called Rodinia.
The supercontinent broke apart during the early part of the Paleozoic.
