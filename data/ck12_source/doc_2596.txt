All of them are solids at room temperature.
Boron is used in borax and boric acid
Boron is a very hard, black metalloid with a high melting point.
In the mineral called borax, it is used to wash clothes.
In boric acid, it is used as an eyewash and insecticide.
Group 14:
Carbon Group
Group 14 of the periodic table is headed by the nonmetal carbon (C), so this group is also called the carbon group.
Carbon is followed by silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) ( Figure below ), which are metalloids, and then by tin (Sn) and lead (Pb), which are metals.
Group 14 elements group have four valence electrons, so they generally aren't very reactive.
All of them are solids at room temperature.
Germanium is used in fiber optic cables
Germanium is a brittle, shiny, silvery-white metalloid.
Along with silicon, it is used to make the tiny electric circuits on computer chips.
It is also used to make fiber optic cables—like the one pictured here—that carry telephone and other communication signals.
Group 15:
Nitrogen Group
Group 15 of the periodic table is also called the nitrogen group.
The first element in the group is the nonmetal nitrogen (N), followed by phosphorus (P), another nonmetal.
Arsenic (As) ( Figure below ) and antimony (Sb) are the metalloids in this group, and bismuth (Bi) is a metal.
