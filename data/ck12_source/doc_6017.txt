Too much sodium azide could cause the formation of more gas that the bag can safely handle.
If the bag breaks from the excess gas pressure, all protection is lost.
Mass to Volume and Volume to Mass Problems
Chemical reactions frequently involve both solid substances whose mass can be measured as well as gases for which measuring the volume is more appropriate.
Stoichiometry problems of this type are called either mass-volume or volume-mass problems.
& \text{mass of} \ given \ \rightarrow \ \text{moles of} \ given \ \rightarrow \ \text{moles of} \ unknown \ \rightarrow \ \text{volume of} \ unknown\\& \text{volume of} \ given \ \rightarrow \ \text{moles of} \ given \ \rightarrow \ \text{moles of} \ unknown \ \rightarrow \ \text{mass of} \ unknown
Because both types of problems involve a conversion from either moles of gas to volume or vice-versa, we can use the molar volume of 22.4 L/mol provided that the conditions for the reaction are STP.
Sample Problem:
Mass-Volume Stoichiometry
Aluminum metal reacts rapidly with aqueous sulfuric acid to produce aqueous aluminum sulfate and hydrogen gas.
2 \text{Al}(s)+3\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 (aq) \rightarrow \text{Al}_2 (\text{SO}_4)_3 (aq)+3\text{H}_2 (g)
Determine the volume of hydrogen gas produced at STP when a 2.00 g piece of aluminum completely reacts.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given: 2.00 g Al
molar mass Al = 26.98 g/mol
2 mol Al = 3 mol H 2
volume H 2 = ?
The grams of aluminum will first be converted to moles.
Then the mole ratio will be applied to convert to moles of hydrogen gas.
