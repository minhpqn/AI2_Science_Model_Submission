Often, the resistance force is the force of gravity, and the resistance distance is how far you move the object.
The ideal mechanical advantage  of a simple machine is the ratio between the distances:
\text{IMA}=\frac{\text{effort distance}}{\text{resistance distance}}
Again, the IMA assumes that there is no friction.
In reality, the mechanical advantage is limited by friction; you must overcome the frictional forces in addition to the resistance force.
Therefore, the actual mechanical advantage  is the ratio of the forces:
\text{AMA}=\frac{\text{resistance force}}{\text{effort force}}
When simple machines are combined to form compound machines, the product of each simple machine's IMA gives the compound machine's IMA.
A lever consists of an inflexible length of material placed over a pivot point called a fulcrum .
The resistance is the object to be moved (shown here in red), and is placed to one side of the fulcrum.
The resistance distance in a lever is called the resistance arm.
The effort is exerted elsewhere on the lever, and the effort distance is called the effort arm or effort lever arm.
The lever shown here is the most common type of lever, a Class One Lever, but there are two other types of levers.

The effort work is the effort force times the effort lever arm.
Similarly, the resistance work is the resistance force times the resistance lever arm.
If we ignore any friction that occurs where the lever pivots over the fulcrum, this is an ideal machine.
Suppose the resistance force is 500.
N, the resistance arm is 0.400 m, and the effort arm is 0.800m.
