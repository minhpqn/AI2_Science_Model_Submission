So do fossil fuels such as natural gas.
Natural gas is a fuel that is commonly used in home furnaces and gas stoves.
The main component of natural gas is the hydrocarbon called methane (CH 4 ).
You can see a methane flame in the Figure below .
The combustion of methane is represented by the equation:
CH 4 + 2O 2 → CO 2 + 2H 2 O
The combustion of methane powers a gas stove
The combustion of methane gas heats a pot on a stove.
Q:
Sometimes the flame on a gas stove isn’t just blue but has some yellow or orange in it.
Why might this occur?
A:
If the flame isn’t just blue, the methane isn’t getting enough oxygen to burn completely, leaving some of the carbon unburned.
The flame will also not be as hot as a completely blue flame for the same reason.
You can simulate the combustion of hydrocarbons, including methane, at this URL:
A complete combustion reaction occurs when a fuel reacts quickly with oxygen (O 2 ) and produces carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O).
The general equation for a complete combustion reaction is:
Fuel + O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 O
The fuel that burns in a combustion reaction usually consists of hydrocarbons, which contain only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).
An example of a hydrocarbon is methane (CH 4 ), the main component of natural gas.
