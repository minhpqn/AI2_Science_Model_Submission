Correlation allows them to understand the geological history of a region.
Absolute age dating gives real dates for geological events.
Radiometric dating uses the ratios of parent and daughter isotopes to indicate age.
The solar system began as a cloud of dust and gas.
That cloud spun and contracted by gravity.
The center became so dense it ignited to form a star.
Clumps of matter came together to form the planets.
Shortly after Earth formed, a giant asteroid struck the planet.
Both Earth and the asteroid melted.
Material was flung out into Earth's orbit.
That material came together to make the Moon.
Earth had to cool before it could support an atmosphere.
Once it had an atmosphere, rain fell into basins to create the oceans.
Gases in the early atmosphere came from volcanic eruptions.
Comets and asteroids also brought in gases.
There was almost no oxygen.
It was not until the evolution of photosynthesis that oxygen collected in the atmosphere.
With oxygen animals could evolve.
Also, oxygen was needed to form the ozone layer.
The early Earth was extremely hot.
