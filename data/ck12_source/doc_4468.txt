Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer lead to the best chance for survival.
That’s why it’s important to know the following warning signs of cancer:
change in bowel or bladder habits
sore that does not heal
unusual bleeding or discharge
lump in the breast or elsewhere
chronic indigestion or difficulty swallowing
obvious changes in a wart or mole
persistent coughing or hoarseness
Having one or more warning signs does not mean you have cancer, but you should see a doctor to be sure.
Getting routine tests for particular cancers can also help detect cancers early, when chances of a cure are greatest.
For example, getting the skin checked regularly by a dermatologist is important for early detection of skin cancer (see Figure below ).
Regular checkups with a dermatologist can detect skin cancers early.
Why is early detection important?
You can take steps to reduce your own risk of cancer.
For example, you can avoid exposure to carcinogens such as tobacco smoke and UV light.
You can also follow a healthy lifestyle.
Being active, eating a low-fat diet, and maintaining a normal weight can help reduce your risk of cancer.
A carcinogen is anything that causes cancer.
Most carcinogens produce mutations in genes that control the cell cycle.
