Nuclear Fission Processes
Define nuclear fission.
Give examples of nuclear fission processes.
Nuclear fission was first discovered by Fritz Strassman and Otto Hahn
An Unexpected Result
Nuclear fission was first discovered by two German scientists, Fritz Strassman and Otto Hahn, in the 1930s.
They began their work by bombarding uranium with neutrons, hoping to create larger elements.
Instead, they were very surprised to find Ba-141, a much smaller element.
They immediately contacted a fellow scientist in the field, Lise Meitner, who carried out calculations to demonstrate that fission had taken place.
Radioactive decay by the release of alpha or beta particles is not the only way new isotopes are formed.
When a neutron collides with a nucleus the nucleus splits into two isotopes, each of which is roughly half the mass of the original atom.
