The efficiency of the ramp is:
\frac{6700 \ \text{J}}{7500 \ \text{J}} \times 100\%=90\%
For an animated ramp and its efficiency, go to this URL:
A machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine, because the machine must use some of the work to overcome friction.
Efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user (input work) that becomes work done by the machine (output work).
It is a measure of how well a machine reduces friction.
You can calculate the efficiency of a machine with this equation: \mathrm{Efficiency=\frac{Output\;work}{Input\;work} \times 100\%}
At the following URL, review efficiency and how to calculate it.
Then do the problems at the bottom of the Web page.
Check the correct answers and the explanations for them.
Why is the output work of a machine always less than the input work done on the machine?
What is the efficiency of a machine?
If a machine requires an input of 5000 joules of work to put out 4000 joules of work, what is the machineâ€™s efficiency?
Define actual and ideal mechanical advantage.
Show how to calculate actual and ideal mechanical advantage.
Identify the mechanical advantage of different types of machines.
Did you ever use a hammer to break open a piggy bank?
When you use a hammer to hit something, you apply force to the end of the handle.
The head of the hammer, in turn, applies force to the piggy bank or whatever object you are striking.
