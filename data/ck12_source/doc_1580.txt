Protecting the Ozone Layer
The Montreal Protocol is a worldwide agreement on air pollution.
It focuses on CFCs.
It was signed by many countries in 1987.
It controls almost 100 chemicals that can damage the ozone layer.
Its aim is to return the ozone layer to its normal state.
The Montreal Protocol has been effective in controlling CFCs.
By 1995, few CFCs were still being used.
But the ozone hole kept growing for several years after that because of the CFCs already in the atmosphere.
It peaked in 2006.
Since then, it has been somewhat smaller.
The Montreal Protocol is a shining example of how nations can come together to solve a global environmental problem.
CFCs float up into the stratosphere where they break apart.
The chlorine pulls an oxygen ion off of an ozone molecule and destroys it.
The ozone hole forms over Antarctica in the spring.
Ozone loss increases the amount of high-energy ultraviolet radiation that strikes Earth.
This can cause ecological and health problems.
