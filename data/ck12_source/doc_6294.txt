effective collision:
Bonds break between atoms.
ineffective collision:
No rearrangement of atoms occurs.
Define activation energy.
Fireworks do not detonate until lit because they have a high activation energy
How do fireworks light up the sky?
The sight of fireworks exploding across the night sky is always exciting.
These materials, invented hundreds of years ago, can be dangerous if not handled properly.
The chemicals do not react until the fuse burns down and heat is applied to the system.
Then the rocket is launched and explodes high in the sky.
Picture of calcium metal

Why do some chemical reactions occur readily while others require input of heat in order to take place?
If we mix metallic sodium with water, a reaction occurs immediately, releasing a great deal of heat (enough to ignite the hydrogen gas that is formed).
Group II metals, such as calcium, react at a much slower rate.
Unlike the extremely vigorous reaction with sodium, the reaction with calcium is slow enough that we can trap the hydrogen gas released.
Supplying reactant particles with energy causes the bonds between the atoms to vibrate with a greater frequency.
This increase in vibrational energy makes a chemical bond more likely to break and a chemical reaction more likely to occur when those particles collide with other particles.
The activation energy for a reaction is the minimum energy that colliding particles must have in order to undergo a reaction.
