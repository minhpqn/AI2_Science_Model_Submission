Using the normal force and the coefficient of friction, we can find the frictional force.
We can also find the mass of the box from its weight since we know the acceleration due to gravity.
Then we can find the net force and the acceleration.
F_F = \mu F_N = (0.20)(2000. \ \text{N}) = 400. \ \text{N}
\text{mass of box}=\frac{\text{weight}}{g}=\frac{2000. \ \text{N}}{9.8 \ \text{m}/\text{s}^2}=204 \ \text{g}
F_{\text{NET}} = \text{pushing force} - \text{frictional force} = 500. \ \text{N} - 400. \ \text{N} = 100. \ \text{N}
a=\frac{F_N}{m}=\frac{100. \ \text{N}}{204 \ \text{kg}}=0.49 \ \text{m/s}^2
Example Problem:
Two boxes are connected by a rope running over a pulley, as shown in the figure below.
The coefficient of sliding friction between box A and the table is 0.20. (Ignore the masses of the rope and the pulley and any friction in the pulley.) The mass of box A is 5.0 kg and the mass of box B is 2.0 kg.
The entire system (both boxes) will move together with the same acceleration and velocity.
Find the acceleration of the system.

Solution:
The force acting to move the system is the weight of box B, and the force resisting the movement is the force of friction between the table and box A.
The mass of the system is the sum of the masses of both boxes.
The acceleration of the system can be found by dividing the net force by the total mass.
F_N (\text{box A}) = mg = (5.0 \ \text{kg})(9.8 \ \text{m/s}^2) = 49 \ \text{N}
F_{\text{friction}} = \mu F_N = (0.20)(49 \ \text{N}) = 9.8 \ \text{N}
\text{Weight of box B} = mg = (2.0 \ \text{kg})( 9.8 \ \text{m/s}^2) = 19.6 \ \text{N}
