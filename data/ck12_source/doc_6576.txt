When the carboxylic acid butanoic acid is heated with an excess of methanol and a few drops of sulfuric acid, the ester methyl butanoate is produced.
Methyl butanoate has the scent of pineapples.
The reaction is shown below with both molecular and structural formulas.
Structure of an esterification reaction
The esterification reaction is reversible.
When an ester is heated in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, the ester breaks down.
The products are an alcohol and the conjugate base of the carboxylic acid as a salt.
& \text{CH}_3\text{COOCH}_2 \text{CH}_3 + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{Na}^+ + \text{CH}_3 \text{CH}_2 \text{OH}\\& \ \ \text{ethyl ethanoate} \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \text{sodium acetate} \qquad \quad \text{ethanol}
The sodium hydroxide is not acting as a catalyst, but is consumed in the reaction.
Saponification describes the alkaline hydrolysis reaction of an ester.
The term saponification originally described the hydrolysis of long-chain esters called fatty acid esters to produce soap molecules, which are the salts of fatty acids.
One such soap molecule is sodium stearate, formed from the hydrolysis of ethyl stearate.
& \text{C}_{17} \text{H}_{35} \text{COOC}_2 \text{H}_5 + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{C}_{17} \text{H}_{35} \text{COO}^- \text{Na}^+ + \text{C}_2 \text{H}_5 \text{OH}\\& \quad \text{ethyl stearate} \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ \ \text{sodium stearate (soap)}
