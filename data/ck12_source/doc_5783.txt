How do s orbit electrons affect the ionization energy of a p electron in the same shell?
Why do group 16 atoms have lower ionization energies than the corresponding group 15 atoms?
electron shielding:
As more electrons are added to a nucleus, the outer electrons become shielded from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons.
inner core electrons:
Electrons that prevent attraction between valence electrons and protons.
Define electron affinity.
Describe trends in electron affinity in the periodic table.
Electron affinity is like an overpacked suitcase
Do you tend to overpack before going on trips?
Packing for a trip can be very challenging.  What do you take with you?  Where will you be going and what will you need?  We usually pack too much (like the suitcase above) and then find it hard to close the suitcase.  When the suitcase is over-full, there is stress on the system and forces pushing the suitcase open.  When electrons are added to an atom, the increased negative charge puts stress on the electrons already there, causing energy to be released.
When electrons are removed from an atom, that process requires energy to pull the electron away from the nucleus.  Addition of an electron releases energy from the process.
In most cases, the formation of an anion by the addition of an electron to a neutral atom releases energy.
This can be shown for the chloride ion formation below:
Cl + e - â†’ Cl - + energy
The energy change that occurs when a neutral atom gains an electron is called its electron affinity .
When energy is released in a chemical reaction or process, that energy is expressed as a negative number.
The figure below shows electron affinities in kJ/mole for the representative elements.  Electron affinities are measured on atoms in the gaseous state and are very difficult to measure accurately.
