So when astronomers see redshift in the light from a galaxy, they know that the galaxy is moving away from Earth.
The strange part is that almost every galaxy in the Universe has a redshift.
Of course, this means that almost every galaxy is moving away from us.
The Expanding Universe
Edwin Hubble combined his measurements of the distances to galaxies with other astronomers’ measurements of redshift.
He noticed a relationship, which is now called Hubble’s Law:
The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us.
In other words, the Universe is expanding!
Pictured below is a simplified diagram of the expansion of the Universe ( Figure below ).
Another way to picture this is to imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots.
Each dot represents a galaxy.
When you inflate the balloon, the dots slowly move away from each other because the rubber stretches in the space between them.
If it were a giant balloon and you were standing on one of the dots, you would see the other dots moving away from you.
Not only that, but dots farther away from you on the balloon would move away faster than dots nearby.
This simplified diagram of the Universe's expansion illustrates how the universe expanded over time
This is a simplified diagram of the expansion of the Universe over time.
Note that the distance between galaxies gets bigger as you go forward in time, but the size of each galaxy stays about the same.
An inflating balloon is not exactly like the expanding Universe.
The surface of a balloon has only two dimensions, while space has three dimensions.
But it is true that space itself is stretching out between galaxies like the rubber stretches when a balloon is inflated.
