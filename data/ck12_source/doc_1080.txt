The Mollweide projection distorts the size of the polar regions much less.
To see the actual size of Greenland, look at a globe.
Earth is a round, three-dimensional ball.
In a small area, Earth looks flat, so it is not hard to make accurate maps of a small place.
When mapmakers want to map the round Earth on flat paper, they use projections.
What happens if you try to flatten out the skin of a peeled orange?
Or if you try to gift wrap a soccer ball?
To flatten out, the orange peel must rip, and its shape must become distorted.
To wrap a round object with flat paper requires lots of extra cuts and folds.
A projection is a way to represent Earth’s curved surface on flat paper ( Figure below ).
A map projection translates Earth's curved surface onto two dimensions
A map projection translates Earth's curved surface onto two dimensions.
There are many types of projections.
Each uses a different way to change three dimensions into two dimensions.
There are two basic methods that the mapmaker uses in projections:
The mapmaker “slices” the sphere in some way and unfolds it to make a flat map.
This is like flattening out an orange peel.
The mapmaker can look at the sphere from a certain point and then translate this view onto a flat paper.
Let’s look at a few commonly used projections.
In 1569, Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594) ( Figure below ) figured out a way to make a flat map of our round world.
