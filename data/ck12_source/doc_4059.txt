Outline the structure of fungi.
Define hyphae and mycelium.
Explain the significance of a fruiting body.
Is the structure important?
Of course.
Though mushrooms may be the most common type of fungus, fungi also include rusts, smuts, puffballs, truffles, morels, molds, and yeasts, as well as many less well-known organisms.
And, except for yeast cells, they all have similar structures, which are usually hidden deep within their food source.
Structure of Fungi
Except for yeasts, which grow as single cells, most fungi grow as thread-like filaments, like those shown in Figure below .
The filaments are called hyphae (singular, hypha).
Each hypha consists of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall.
A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus, which is called a mycelium (plural, mycelia).
The hyphae of most fungi are divided into cells by internal walls called septa (singular, septum).
Septa usually have little pores that are large enough to allow ribosomes, mitochondria and sometimes nuclei to flow among cells.
Hyphae that are divided into cells are called septate hyphae .
However, the hyphae of some fungi are not separated by septa.
Hyphae without septae are called coenocytic hyphae .
Coenocytic hyphae are big, multinucleated cells.
Hyphae of the penicillium mold
These branches are hyphae, or filaments, of a mold called Penicillium
