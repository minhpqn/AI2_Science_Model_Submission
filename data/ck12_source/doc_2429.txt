When components of mixtures vary in physical properties such as these, processes such as boiling, dissolving, or filtering can be used to separate them.
Look at the Figure below of the Great Salt Lake in Utah.
The water in the lake is a solution of salt and water.
Do you see the white salt deposits near the shore?
How did the salt separate from the salt water?
Water has a lower boiling point than salt, and it evaporates in the heat of the sun.
With its higher boiling point, the salt doesnâ€™t get hot enough to evaporate, so it is left behind.

Q:
Suppose you have a mixture of salt and pepper.
What properties of the salt and pepper might allow you to separate them?
A:
Salt dissolves in water but pepper does not.
If you mix salt and pepper with water, only the salt will dissolve, leaving the pepper floating in the water.
You can separate the pepper from the water by pouring the mixture through a filter, such as a coffee filter.
Q:
After you separate the pepper from the salt water, how could you separate the salt from the water?
A:
You could heat the water until it boils and evaporates.
The salt would be left behind.
