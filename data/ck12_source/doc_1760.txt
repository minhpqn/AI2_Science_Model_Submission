How do you think El Niño affects climate on the western coast of South America?
This ABC News video explores the relationship of El Niño to global warming.
El Niño is named as the cause of strange weather across the United States in the winter of 2007 in this video:

La Niña ( Figure below ) generally follows El Niño.
It occurs when the Pacific Ocean is cooler than normal.
The trade winds are like they are in a normal year.
They blow from east to west.
But in a La Niña, the winds are stronger than usual.
More cool water builds up in the western Pacific.
These changes can also affect climates worldwide.

How do you think La Niña affects climate on the western coast of South America?
Some scientists think that global warming is affecting the cycle of El Niño and La Niña.
These short-term changes seem to be cycling faster now than in the past.
They are also more extreme.
An online guide to El Niño and La Niña events from the University of Illinois is found here:
El Niño and La Niña are two examples of short-term climate changes lasting one to a few years.
In an El Niño, the trade winds reverse direction, as do the equatorial surface currents.
This causes warm water to pool off of South America and stop upwelling.
