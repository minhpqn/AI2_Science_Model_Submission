What’s on your mind?
The brain is a marvelous organ.
And it’s a hungry one, too.
The major fuel for the brain is the carbohydrate glucose.
The average adult brain represents about 2% of our body’s weight, but uses 25% of the glucose in the body.
Moreover, specific areas of the brain use glucose at different rates.
If you are concentrating hard, (taking a test, for example) certain parts of the brain need a lot of extra glucose while other parts of the brain only use their normal amount.
Something to think about.
Some foods that are high in carbohydrates include bread, pasta, and potatoes.
Because carbohydrates are easily digested, athletes often rely on carbohydrate rich foods to enable a high level of performance.
Carbohydrate food sources
Foods that serve as carbohydrate sources.
The term carbohydrate comes from the fact that the majority contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a ratio of 1:2:1, making for an empirical formula of CH 2 O.
This is somewhat misleading because the molecules are not actually hydrates of carbon at all.
Carbohydrates are monomers and polymers of aldehydes and ketones that have multiple hydroxyl groups attached.
Carbohydrates are the most abundant source of energy found in most foods.
The simplest carbohydrates, also called simple sugars, are plentiful in fruits.
A monosaccharide is a carbohydrate consisting of one sugar unit.
