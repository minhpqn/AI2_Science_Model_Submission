Q:
Imagine!
Each of the trillions of cells in your body is continuously performing thousands of catabolic and anabolic reactions.
That’s an amazing number of biochemical reactions—far more than the number of reactions that might take place in a lab or factory.
How can so many biochemical reactions take place simultaneously in our cells?
A:
So many reactions can occur because biochemical reactions are amazingly fast.
Q:
In a lab or factory, reactants can be heated to very high temperatures or placed under great pressure so they will react very quickly.
These ways of speeding up chemical reactions can’t occur inside the delicate cells of living things.
So how do cells speed up biochemical reactions?
A:
The answer is enzymes.
The Importance of Enzymes
Enzymes are proteins that increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting.
Enzymes are synthesized in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded in the cell’s DNA.
Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again.
Enzymes are highly specific for certain chemical reactions, so they are very effective.
A reaction that would take years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme.
Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form.
