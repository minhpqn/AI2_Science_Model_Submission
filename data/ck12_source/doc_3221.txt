It takes the ultrasound wave 0.6 seconds to travel from the device to the sunken ship and back again.
How far below the surface is the sunken ship?
How is ultrasonography like sonar?
Define electromagnetic wave and electromagnetic radiation.
Describe the electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave.
Explain how electromagnetic waves begin and how they travel.
State how electromagnetic waves may interact with matter.
Identify sources of electromagnetic waves.
Did you ever wonder how a microwave works?
It directs invisible waves of radiation toward the food placed inside of it.
The radiation transfers energy to the food, causing it to get warmer.
The radiation is in the form of microwaves, which are a type of electromagnetic waves.
