Step 2:
Calculate.
\frac{0.761 \ \text{g}}{1 \ \text{L}} \times \frac{22.4 \ \text{L}}{1 \ \text{mol}}=17.0 \ \text{g} / \text{mol}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Because the density of the gas is less than 1 g/L, the molar mass is less than 22.4.
Calculations are described showing conversions between molar mass and density for gases.
Use the link below to answer the following questions:
Which of the gases has the highest density?
Which gas has the lowest density?
Would you expect nitrogen to have a higher or lower density that oxygen?
Why?
How is density calculated?
How is molar mass calculated?
What would be the volume of 3.5 moles of a gas?
Mole Road Map
Perform calculations involving interconversions of mass, moles, and volume of a gas.
Chemistry road maps are similar to actual maps
How do I get from here to there?
If I want to visit the town of Manteo, North Carolina, out on the coast, I will need a map of how to get there.  I may have a printed map or I may download directions from the internet, but I need something to get me going in the right direction.  Chemistry road maps serve the same purpose.  How do I handle a certain type of calculation?
