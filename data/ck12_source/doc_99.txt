Many lizards are capable of regenerating lost limbs or tails.
Almost all lizards are carnivorous , meaning they eat animals, although most are so small that insects are their primary prey.
However, some have reached sizes where they can prey on birds and mammals.
On the other hand, a few species of lizards exclusively eat plants.
Have you ever tried catching a lizard?
Many lizards are good climbers or fast sprinters.
Some can run on two feet, such as the collared lizard.
Some, like the basilisk, can even run across the surface of water to escape danger.
Many lizards can change color in response to their environments or in times of stress ( Figure below ).
The most familiar example is the chameleon, but more subtle color changes can occur in other lizard species.

Some lizard species, including the glass lizard and flap-footed lizards, have evolved to lose their legs, or their legs are so small that they no longer work.
This provides these species an evolutionary advantage in their way of life.
Legless lizards almost look like snakes, though structures leftover from earlier stages of evolution remain.
For example, flap-footed lizards can be distinguished from snakes by their external ears.
Characteristics of Snakes
Snakes are different from legless lizards because they do not have eyelids, limbs, external ears, or forelimbs.
The more than 2,700 species of snake can be found on every continent except Antarctica and range in size from the tiny, 4-inch-long thread snake to pythons, to the over 17-foot-long anaconda ( Figure below ).
In order to fit inside of snakesâ€™ narrow bodies, paired organs, such as kidneys, appear one in front of the other instead of side by side.
