Models of very complex systems are often based on mathematical equations or computer simulations.
A person who develops a model must be able to recognize whether a model reflects reality.
They must also be able to identify and work with differences between actual data and theory.
A model is evaluated mostly by how it reflects past observations of the phenomenon.
Any model that is not consistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected.
However, a fit to observed data alone is not enough for a model to be accepted as valid.
Other factors important in evaluating a model include:
its ability to explain past observations,
its ability to predict future observations,
its ability to control events,
the cost of its use, especially when used with other models,
ease of use and how it looks.
Some examples of the different types of models that are used by science are shown in Figures below and below .
A computer model of wind patterns across the continental United States for 21 June, 2013.
This model is used to forecast wind speeds and directions.
Data on wind speed, direction, and related data are entered into a computer which then produces this simulation.
This visual model is much easier for a person to understand than a large table of numbers.
Biosphere 2 is an example of a very large three-dimensional model which biologists built to attempt to recreate a self-sustaining biome.
