So the heat of reaction for the combination of carbon with hydrogen to produce acetylene is 228.3 kJ.
When one mole of acetylene is produced, 228.3 kJ of heat are absorbed, making the reaction endothermic.
Hess’ Law is used to calculate the heat of reaction for processes that cannot be measured directly.
Do the problems (as many as you have time for) at the link below:
List two reasons direct measurement of a heat of reaction may not be feasible.
State Hess’ law.
If a combustion reaction is reversed, what needs to happen to the  \triangle \text{H} value?
Hess’s law of heat summation:
If two or more thermochemical equations can be added together to give a final equation, then the heats of reaction can also be added to give a heat of reaction for the final equation.
Standard Heat of Formation
Define standard heat of formation.
List some factors affecting the standard heat of formation.
The heat of formation for diamond is different than that of graphite
Is the Hope diamond just a very expensive pencil?
The Hope diamond is a very expensive piece of jewelry, currently worth about $350 million.
A pencil can be purchased for less than a dollar.
Both items contain carbon, but there is a big difference in how that carbon is organized.
The diamond was formed under very different reaction conditions than the graphite, so it has a different heat of formation.
Standard Heat of Formation
A relatively straightforward chemical reaction is one in which elements are combined to form a compound.
