Reproduction of Fungi
The majority of fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually.
This allows them to adjust to conditions in the environment.
They can spread quickly through asexual reproduction when conditions are stable.
They can increase their genetic variation through sexual reproduction when conditions are changing and variation may help them survive.
Almost all fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores.
A fungal spore is a haploid cell produced by mitosis from a haploid parent cell.
It is genetically identical to the parent cell.
Fungal spores can develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized.
Spores may be dispersed by moving water, wind, or other organisms.
Some fungi even have “cannons” that “shoot” the spores far from the parent organism.
This helps to ensure that the offspring will not have to compete with the parent for space or other resources.
You are probably familiar with puffballs, like the one in Figure below .
They release a cloud of spores when knocked or stepped on.
Wherever the spores happen to land, they do not germinate until conditions are favorable for growth.
Then they develop into new hyphae .
Puffballs release spores when disturbed.
Puffballs release spores when disturbed.
Yeasts do not produce spores.
Instead, they reproduce asexually by budding.
