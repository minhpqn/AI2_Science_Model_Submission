Microevolution and Macroevolution
Define microevolution and macroevolution.
Distinguish between microevolution and macroevolution.
Why do pesticides sometimes stop working?
Pesticides were designed to kill bothersome insects.
However, sometimes these pesticides will stop working.
A pesticide that has worked in the past may no longer kill a particular type of insect.
This is due to the development of resistance in the population of insects.
The development of resistance to pesticides is one example of microevolution, a small change in a population.
