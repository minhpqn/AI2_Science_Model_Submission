For example, hydrogen (H) has just one proton, helium (He) always has two protons ( Figure below ), while sodium (Na) always has 11.
All the atoms of a particular element have the exact same number of protons, and the number of protons is that element's atomic number .
An atom usually has the same number of protons and electrons, but sometimes an atom may gain or lose an electron, giving the atom a positive or negative charge.
These atoms are known as ions and are depicted with a "+" or "-" sign.
Ions, such as H + , Na + , K + , or Cl - have significant biological roles.
Drawing of an atom of helium
An atom of Helium (He) contains two positively charged protons (red), two uncharged neutrons (blue), and two negatively charged electrons (yellow).
The Periodic Table
In 1869, a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev created the periodic table , which is a way of organizing elements according to their unique characteristics, like atomic number, density, boiling point, and other values ( Figure below ).
Each element is represented by a one or two letter symbol.
For example, H stands for hydrogen, and Au stands for gold.
The vertical columns in the periodic table are known as groups, and elements in groups tend to have very similar properties.
The table is also divided into rows, known as periods.
The periodic table
The periodic table groups the elements based on their properties.
The table begins with Hydrogen, atomic number 1.
A molecule is any combination of two or more atoms.
The oxygen in the air we breathe is two oxygen atoms connected by a chemical bond to form O 2 , or molecular oxygen.
A carbon dioxide molecule is a combination of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, CO 2 .
Because carbon dioxide includes two different elements, it is a compound as well as a molecule.
