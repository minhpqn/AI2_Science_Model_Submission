fresh water :
Naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and underground as groundwater in aquifers and underground streams; characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids.
precipitation :
Forms when water droplets in clouds become large enough to fall, forming rain, snow, or other type of falling moisture.
sublimation :
The transformation of snow and ice directly into water vapor; occurs as the snow and ice are heated by the sun.
transpiration :
A process by which plants lose water; occurs when stomata in leaves open to take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and lose water to the atmosphere in the process.
water cycle :
The continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth; also called the hydrologic cycle.
Most of Earth’s water is salt water located on the planet’s surface.
Water is constantly recycled through the water cycle, cycling through both the living and non-living parts of the biosphere.
