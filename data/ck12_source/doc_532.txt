But childhood cancer is rare.
Leukemia is the main type of cancer in children.
It makes up about one third of all childhood cancers.
It happens when the body makes abnormal white blood cells.
Sometimes cancer cells break away from a tumor.
If they enter the bloodstream, they are carried throughout the body.
Then, the cells may start growing in other tissues.
This is usually how cancer spreads from one part of the body to another.
Once this happens, cancer is very hard to stop or control.
If leukemia is treated early, it usually can be cured.
In fact, many cancers can be cured, which is known as remission, if treated early.
Treatment of cancer often involves removing a tumor with surgery.
This may be followed by other types of treatments.
These treatments may include drugs (known as chemotherapy) and radiation therapy, which kill cancer cells.
The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure.
This is why it is important to know the warning signs of cancer.
Having warning signs does not mean that you have cancer.
However, you should see a doctor to be sure.
Everyone should know the warning signs of cancer.
Detecting and treating cancer early can often lead to a cure.
