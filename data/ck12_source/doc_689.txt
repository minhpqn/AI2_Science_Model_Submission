Images in a Plane Mirror
Describe the image produced by a plane mirror.
Understand a virtual image.
Identical twins that look like they are in a mirror
Is this a picture of one girl in front of a mirror or is this a picture of twins designed to look like a mirror image?
The writing on the shirt is properly mirror reversed, and, as in plane mirror images, the right hand of the object becomes the left hand of the image.
However, if you look closely, you will see that in the picture one girl is wearing a ring and the other isnâ€™t.
Image in a Plane Mirror
The sketch below shows how we see an image in a plane mirror.
Plane mirrors work because the light rays create a virtual image  behind the mirror.
Light rays from the object strike the mirror and reflect according to the law of reflection.
When some of the light rays enter our eye, our eye and brain interpret these rays as having traveled in a straight line path.
Therefore, our eye and brain track the light rays backward to a position from which they appear to have come.
At this position, we see an image.
Illustrates how an image is formed on a plane mirror
In a plane mirror, the image will be the same size as the object and will be the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.
This image is called a virtual image because the light does not actually pass through the image.
Example Problem:
A person 1.80 m tall stands in front of a plane mirror.
What is the minimum height of the mirror, and how high must its lower edge be above the floor for the person to be able to see his/her whole body?
