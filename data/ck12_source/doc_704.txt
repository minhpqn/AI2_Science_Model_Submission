The yellow arrow on the right of the lens is the inverted image.
The diagram above shows the situation when the object is outside 2F .
In this situation, the image will be between F  and 2F  on the other side and will be inverted, diminished, and real.
A real image can be projected on a screen.
That is, if you placed a sheet of paper at the image position, the image would actually appear on the paper.
If the object is placed between 2F  and F , the image will appear beyond 2F  on the other side.
The image will be real, inverted, and enlarged.
You can do a ray tracing like the one shown to demonstrate this is true.
If the object is placed inside F  (between F  and the lens), the image will be on the same side of the lens as the object and it will be virtual, upright, and enlarged.
In the sketch below, the object is red and has been placed inside F .
The ray that approaches the mirror parallel to the principal axis is dotted yellow.
It refracts through the focal point, also shown in dotted yellow.
The ray that approaches the mirror through the focal point is dotted blue and refracts parallel to the principal axis, also shown in dotted blue.
As you can see, the refracted rays diverge, so there will be no real image.
If the eye is placed beyond the object around the 2F  shown in the sketch, the eye will see the rays as if they have traveled in a straight line.
These imaginary rays will converge at the tip of the green arrow which is the image position.
Virtual image formed by a convex lens
Example Problem:
An object is 40.0 cm to the left of a convex lens of +8.00 cm focal length.
Determine the image distance.
