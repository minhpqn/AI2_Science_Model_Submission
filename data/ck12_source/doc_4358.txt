Seahorses also swim upright, a characteristic not shared by other fish.
Seahorses are poor swimmers, so they are most likely to be found resting, with their prehensile tails wound around a stationary object.
They have long snouts, which they use to suck up food, and eyes that can move independently of each other.
Seahorses eat small shrimp, tiny fish, crustaceans, and plankton.
Classification of Fish
There are about 28,000 existing species of fish, and they are placed in five different classes.
The classes are commonly referred to as hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned fish, and lobe-finned fish (see the table in the previous lesson).
Hagfish are very primitive fish.
They retain their notochord throughout life rather than developing a backbone, and they lack scales and fins.
They are classified as vertebrates mainly because they have a cranium.
Hagfish are noted for secreting large amounts of thick, slimy mucus.
The mucus makes them slippery, so they can slip out of the jaws of predators.
Like hagfish, lampreys also lack scales, but they have fins and a partial backbone.
The most striking feature of lampreys is a large round sucker, lined with teeth, that surrounds the mouth (see Figure below ).
Lampreys use their sucker to feed on the blood of other fish species.

Sucker Mouth of a Lamprey.
The mouth of a lamprey is surrounded by a tooth-lined sucker.
Cartilaginous fish include sharks, rays, and ratfish (see Figure below ).
In addition to an endoskeleton composed of cartilage, these fish have a complete backbone.
