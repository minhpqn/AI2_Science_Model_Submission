How might you do the testing yourself?
To test a hypothesis you need data.
How do you collect data?
By making observations or running experiments.
Observations can happen on many scales.
You can use a microscope to observe tiny things.
You can use a telescope to observe distant things in space.
To learn about the effects of climate change, you could observe Earth's surface.
How would you make observations of Earth's surface?
You could do this from the land surface or from space.
Many important observations are made by orbiting satellites.
These satellites have a bird's eye view of how the planet is changing ( Figure below ).

Observations are made when it is not possible to do experiments.
Scientists send devices to make observations in dangerous places.
They send devices to places that are difficult for people to go.
For example, many rovers have been to Mars ( Figure below ).
There will probably be many more before the first human gets there.
