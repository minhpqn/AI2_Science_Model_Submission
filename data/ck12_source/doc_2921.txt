Male or female?
One of the exciting things about expecting a child is wondering if the baby will be a boy or a girl.
There are many superstitions about how one might influence or predict the outcome.
But what really determines if a baby is male or female?
We now know that the gender of a baby is determined by a special pair of chromosomes known as the sex chromosomes.
What determines if a baby is a male or female?
Recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes—and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes .
Everyone has two sex chromosomes.
Your sex chromosomes can be X or Y.
Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY).
If a baby inherits an X chromosome from the father and an X chromosome from the mother, what will be the child’s sex?
The baby will have two X chromosomes, so it will be female.
If the father’s sperm carries the Y chromosome, the child will be male.
Notice that a mother can only pass on an X chromosome, so the sex of the baby is determined by the father.
The father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the Y or X chromosome, so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male, and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female.
