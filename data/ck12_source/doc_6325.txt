The concentrations of each substance, indicated by the square brackets around the formula, are measured in molarity units (mol/L).
The value of the equilibrium constant for any reaction is only determined by experiment.
As detailed in the above section, the position of equilibrium for a given reaction does not depend on the starting concentrations and so the value of the equilibrium constant is truly constant.
It does, however, depend on the temperature of the reaction.
This is because equilibrium is defined as a condition resulting from the rates of forward and reverse reactions being equal.
If the temperature changes, the corresponding change in those reaction rates will alter the equilibrium constant.
For any reaction in which a  K_{eq} is given, the temperature should be specified.
The equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction is described.

equilibrium constant (K_{eq}) :
The ratio of the mathematical product of the concentrations of the products of a reaction to the mathematical product of the concentrations of the reactants of the reaction.
Each concentration is raised to the power of its coefficient in the balanced chemical equation.
