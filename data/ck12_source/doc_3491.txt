The scientific method is the process by which biological information, like that of all other sciences, has been identified.
This has resulted in a number of important biological scientific theories, including the cell theory and the theory of evolution.
All life is built around carbon, and four categories of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
One particular type of protein, enzymes, are biological catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions to proceed at the rate necessary to maintain life.
One other molecule, water, is also essential to life, though water is not an organic compound.
