The joule, however, is a very small unit of energy and using the joule to state the amount of energy used by a household would require a very large number.
For that reason, electric companies measure their energy sales in a large number of joules called a kilowatt hour  (kWh).
A kilowatt hour is exactly as it sounds - the number of kilowatts (1,000 W) transferred per hour.
1.00 \ \text{kilowatt hour} = (1000 \ J/s)(3600 \ s) = 3.6 \times 10^6 \ J
Example Problem:
A color television uses about 2.0 A when operated on 120 V.
How much power does the set use?
If the TV is operated for 8.00 hours per day, how much energy in kWh does it use per day?
At $0.15 per kWh, what does it cost to run the TV for 30 days?
P = VI = (120 \ V)(2.0 \ A) = 240 \ W
E=\frac{(240 \ J/s)(8 \ h)(3600 \ s/h)}{3.6 \times 10^6 \ J/kWh}=1.92 \ kWh
\text{Cost} = (1.92 \ kWh)(30)(\$0.15) = \$8.64
Electric power is the energy per unit time converted by an electric circuit into another form of energy.
The formula for electric power is  P = I^2R .
The electric energy transferred to a resistor in a time period is equal to the electric power multiplied by time, E = Pt , and can also be calculated using E = I^2Rt .
Electric companies measure their energy sales in a large number of joules called a kilowatt hour (kWh) which is equivalent to 3.6 \times 10^6 \ J .
