For example, they are enclosed by a plasma membrane and have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
A typical plant cell is represented by the diagram in Figure below .
Parts of a plant cell
Plant cells have all the same structures as animal cells, plus some additional structures.
Can you identify the unique plant structures in the diagram?
Plant Cell Structures
Structures found in plant cells but not animal cells include a large central vacuole, cell wall, and plastids such as chloroplasts.
The large central vacuole is surrounded by its own membrane and contains water and dissolved substances.
Its primary role is to maintain pressure against the inside of the cell wall, giving the cell shape and helping to support the plant.
The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane.
It consists mainly of cellulose and may also contain lignin , which makes it more rigid.
The cell wall shapes, supports, and protects the cell.
It prevents the cell from absorbing too much water and bursting.
It also keeps large, damaging molecules out of the cell.
Plastids are membrane-bound organelles with their own DNA.
Examples are chloroplasts and chromoplasts.
Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis .
Chromoplasts make and store other pigments.
They give flower petals their bright colors.
