The straw in the Figure below looks bent where light travels from water to air.
Light travels more quickly in air than in water and changes direction.

Scattering occurs when light bumps into tiny particles of matter and spreads out in all directions.
In the Figure below , beams of light from car headlights are shining through fog.
The light is scattered by water droplets in the air, giving the headlights a “halo” appearance.

Q:
What might be another example of light scattering?
A:
When light passes through smoky air, it is scattered by tiny particles of soot.
Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter.
This is called absorption .
When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter.
If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color.
That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.
Q:
In hot sunny climates, people often dress in light-colored clothes.
Why is this a good idea?
