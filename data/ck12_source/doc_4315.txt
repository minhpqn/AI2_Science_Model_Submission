Some reproduce, while others care for the young.
Still others get food or defend the nest.
Termite Nest.
This cathedral-like structure is the nest of a huge colony of termites in Australia.
In fact, it is the world’s largest known termite nest.
It towers 7.5 meters (25 feet) above the ground and houses millions of termites.
Living in a large colony requires good communication.
Ants communicate with chemicals called pheromones .
For example, an ant deposits pheromones on the ground as it returns to the nest from a food source.
It is marking the path so other ants can find the food.
Honeybees communicate by doing a “waggle dance.”

In the process, he hopes to catalog all of the world's 30,000 ant species before they become casualties of habitat loss.
