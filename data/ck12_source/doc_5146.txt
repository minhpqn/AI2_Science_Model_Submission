As you can see, mitosis is a multistage process that ensures separation of sister chromatids, and ensures that daughter cells are just like the parent cell.
Mitosis is the division of the cellâ€™s nucleus, the final step before two daughter cells are produced.
Mitosis begins immediately at the conclusion of interphase, specifically at the end of the G 2 phase.
The cell enters mitosis as it approaches its size limitations.
Four distinct phases of mitosis have been recognized: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, with each phase merging into the next one ( Figure below ).
See All cells arise from pre-existing cells at for an animation of Walther Flemming discussing his description of mitosis.
has an excellent animation of mitosis.
Mitosis is the phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle that occurs between DNA replication and the formation of two daughter cells.
What happens during mitosis?
During mitosis, the nucleus divides, paving the way for two cells to be produced after cell division, each with a complete makeup of genetic material.
The phases of mitosis are discussed in the video:

Prophase is the first and longest phase of mitosis, see Figure below .
During prophase, the chromatin (DNA) coils up into visible chromosomes, each made up of two sister chromatids held together by the centromere.
Also during this phase, the nucleolus disappears, and the spindle begins to form from the centrioles.
Most eukaryotic cells contain structures known as centrosomes, consisting of a pair of centrioles.
During prophase, the centrioles begin to move to opposite ends, or poles, of the cell.
As the centrioles migrate, the fiber-like spindle begins to elongate between the centrioles.
The spindle is a thin, cage-like structure made out of microtubules.
In plant cells, the spindle forms without centrioles.
