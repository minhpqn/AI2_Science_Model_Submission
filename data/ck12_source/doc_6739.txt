A 700kg car makes a turn going at 30 m/s with radius of curvature of 120m.
What is the force of friction between the car’s tires and the road?
An object of mass 10 \;\mathrm{kg} is in a circular orbit of radius 10 \;\mathrm{m} at a velocity of 10 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
Calculate the centripetal force (in N ) required to maintain this orbit.
What is the acceleration of this object?
Suppose you are spinning a child around in a circle by her arms.
The radius of her orbit around you is 1 meter.
Her speed is 1 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
Her mass is 25 \;\mathrm{kg} .
What is the magnitude and direction of tension in your arms?
In her arms?
A racecar is traveling at a speed of 80.0 \;\mathrm{m/s} on a circular racetrack of radius 450 \;\mathrm{m} .
What is its centripetal acceleration in \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 ?
What is the centripetal force on the racecar if its mass is 500 \;\mathrm{kg} ?
What provides the necessary centripetal force in this case?
The radius of the Earth is 6380 \;\mathrm{km} .
Calculate the velocity of a person standing at the equator due to the Earth’s 24 hour rotation.
Calculate the centripetal acceleration of this person and express it as a fraction of the acceleration g due to gravity.
Is there any danger of “flying off”?
