An adult organism produces gametes that quickly go through fertilization and form diploid zygotes.
The zygotes mature into adults, which live for many years.
Eventually the adults produce gametes and the cycle repeats.
What type of life cycle does this organism have?
Explain your answer.
Which life cycle is the simplest?
Why?
Describe the alternation of generations life cycle.
The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms.
Cell Biology focuses on significant aspects of the cell from its structure to its division.
Some organisms contain just one cell, and others contain trillions.
Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not.
Some have many organelles, others do not.
But all cells are surrounded by a cell membrane.
And it is this semipermeable membrane that determines what can enter and leave the cell.
All cells need energy, and for many organisms, this energy comes from photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
All cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division, which can produce a new prokaryotic organism.
The cell cycle, which includes mitosis, defines the life of an eukaryotic cell.
