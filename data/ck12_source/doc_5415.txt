A cis-regulatory element may be located in a geneâ€™s promoter region, in an intron, or in the 3' region.
A regulatory protein , or a transcription factor , is a protein involved in regulating gene expression.
It is usually bound to a cis-regulatory element.
Regulatory proteins often must be bound to a cis-regulatory element to switch a gene on (activator), or to turn a gene off (repressor).
Common cis-regulatory elements include the TATA box, Pribnow box and CCAAT box.
More about transcription factors will be discussed in the Regulation of Gene Expression:
Transcription Factors (Advanced) concept.
The TATA Box
The TATA box is a cis-regulatory element found in the promoter region of genes in archaea and eukaryotes.
It is a highly conserved sequence, believed to have remained consistent throughout much of the evolution.
Approximately 24% of human genes contain a TATA box within the core promoter.
The TATA box has the core DNA sequence 5'-TATAAA-3' or a slight variant.
It is usually located 25 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site.
During transcription, the TATA binding protein binds to the TATA box.
This protein helps unwind the DNA double helix, allowing RNA polymerase II to bind and begin transcription.
However, prior to RNA polymerase binding to the promoter, the TATA binding protein interacts with other factors to form TFIID, a general transcription factor that is part of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex.
TFIIA binds to the upstream part of TFIID while TFIIB binds to the downstream part of TFIID.
Now RNA polymerase recognizes this multi-protein complex and binds to it, along with various other transcription factors, initiating transcription.
RNA polymerase moves along the DNA strand, leaving TFIID and TFIIA bound to the TATA box where they can then facilitate the binding of additional RNA polymerase II molecules.
The complex of RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors is known as a basal transcriptional complex (BTC) .
