How many genes are on chromosome #1?
How big is the human genome?
How much genetic variation is there among people?
How much of the genome is not part of any gene?
Describe the human genome.
What has the Human Genome Project achieved?
Describe the makeup of the human genome.
Human Chromosomes and Genes
Describe human autosomes and sex chromosomes.
Summarize the importance of alleles in humans.
Coiled bundles of DNA and proteins, containing hundreds or thousands of genes.
What are these things?
Chromosomes.
These ensure that each cell receives the proper amount of DNA during cell division.
And usually people have 46 of them, 23 from each parent.
Chromosomes and Genes
Each species has a characteristic number of chromosomes.
Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins called histones ( Figure below ).
Chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division.
See the "Chromosomes" section for additional information.
