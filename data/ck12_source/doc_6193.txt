However, there is a better way to show what is happening in this reaction.
All of the aqueous compounds should be written as ions because they are present in the water as separated ions because of their dissociation.
\text{Na}^+(aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq)+\text{Ag}^+(aq)+\text{NO}^-_3 (aq) \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ (aq)+\text{NO}^-_3 (aq)+\text{AgCl}(s)
This equation is called an ionic equation , an equation in which dissolved ionic compounds are shown as free ions.
Some other double-replacement reactions do not produce a precipitate as one of the products.
The production of a gas and/or a molecular compound such as water may also drive the reaction.
For example, consider the reaction of a solution of sodium carbonate with a solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl).
The products of the reaction are aqueous sodium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water.
The balanced molecular equation is:
\text{Na}_2 \text{CO}_3 (aq)+2\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{CO}_2(g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
The ionic equation is:
2\text{Na}^+(aq)+\text{CO}^{2-}_3 (aq)+2\text{H}^+ (aq)+2\text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{Na}^+(aq)+2\text{Cl}^-(aq)+\text{CO}_2 (g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
A single-replacement reaction is one in which an element replaces another element in a compound.
An element is in either the solid, liquid, or gas state and is not an ion.
The example below shows the reaction of solid magnesium metal with aqueous silver nitrate to form aqueous magnesium nitrate and silver metal.
Balanced molecular equation:
\text{Mg}(s)+2\text{AgNO}_3 (aq) \rightarrow \text{Mg(NO}_3)_2 (aq)+2\text{Ag}(s)
\text{Mg}(s)+2\text{Ag}^+ (aq)+2\text{NO}^-_3 (aq) \rightarrow \text{Mg}^{2+}(aq)+2\text{NO}^-_3 (aq)+2\text{Ag}(s)
This type of single-replacement reaction is called a metal replacement.
Other common categories of single-replacement reactions are hydrogen replacement and halogen replacement.
