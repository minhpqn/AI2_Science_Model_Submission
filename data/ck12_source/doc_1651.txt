Explain chromosome structure.
Define sister chromatids.
List the phases of mitosis.
Summarize the phases of mitosis.
How is your DNA organized?
Your DNA is organized into chromosomes, the pink structures pictured above.
Your DNA doesn't always look so pretty, though.
It only winds tightly into chromosomes when the cell is getting ready to divide.
If your DNA wasn't organized into chromosomes, your DNA would look like a mass of strings and would be difficult to divide up!
Mitosis and Chromosomes
The genetic information of the cell, or DNA, is stored in the nucleus .
During mitosis , two nuclei (plural for nucleus) must form, so that one nucleus can be in each of the new cells after the cell divides.
In order to create two genetically identical nuclei, DNA inside of the nucleus must be copied or replicated.
This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle.
During mitosis, the copied DNA is divided into two complete sets, so that after cytokinesis , each cell has a complete set of genetic instructions.
To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes .
Each organism has a unique number of chromosomes.
In human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical sister chromatids , forming an "X" shaped molecule ( Figure below ).
The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the centromere .
