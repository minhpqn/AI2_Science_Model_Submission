Part 12.11A :
First, we will calculate the theoretical yield based on the stoichiometry.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given: mass of KClO 3 = 40.0 g
molar mass KClO 3 = 122.55 g/mol
molar mass O 2 = 32.00 g/mol
theoretical yield O 2 = ? g
Apply stoichiometry to convert from the mass of a reactant to the mass of a product:
\text{g KClO}_3 \rightarrow \text{mol KClO}_3 \rightarrow \text{mol O}_2 \rightarrow \text{g O}_2
Step 2:
Solve.
40.0 \text{ g KClO}_3 \times \frac{1 \text{ mol KClO}_3}{122.55 \text{ g KClO}_3} \times \frac{3 \text{ mol O}_2}{2 \text{ mol KClO}_3} \times \frac{32.00 \text{ g O}_2}{1 \text{ mol O}_2}=15.7 \text{ g O}_2
The theoretical yield of O 2 is 15.7 g.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The mass of oxygen gas must be less than the 40.0 g of potassium chlorate that was decomposed.
Part 12.11B :  Now we use the actual yield and the theoretical yield to calculate the percent yield.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
