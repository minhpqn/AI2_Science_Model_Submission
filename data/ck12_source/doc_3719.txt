Half of the parent DNA molecule is conserved in each of the two daughter DNA molecules.
Chargaff's rules state that the amount of A is similar to the amount of T, and the amount of G is similar to the amount of C.
Watson and Crick discovered that DNA has a double helix shape, consisting of two polynucleotide chains held together by bonds between complementary bases.
