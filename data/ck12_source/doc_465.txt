The nervous system, together with the endocrine system, controls all the other organ systems.
The nervous system sends one type of signal around the body, and the endocrine system sends another type of signal around the body.
The endocrine system makes and releases chemical messenger molecules, or hormones, which tell other body parts that a change or a reaction is necessary.
So what type of signal does the nervous system send?
Controlling muscles and maintaining balance are just two of the roles of the nervous system.
The nervous system also lets you:
Sense your surroundings with your eyes and other sense organs.
Sense the environment inside of your body, including temperature.
Control your internal body systems and keep them in balance.
Prepare your body to fight or flee in an emergency.
Use language, think, learn, and remember.
The nervous system works by sending and receiving electrical signals.
The main organs of the nervous system are the brain and the spinal cord.
The signals are carried by nerves in the body, similar to the wires that carry electricity all over a house.
The signals travel from all over the body to the spinal cord and up to the brain, as well as moving in the other direction.
For example, when Michelle started to fall off her scooter, her nervous system sensed that she was losing her balance.
It responded by sending messages from her brain to muscles in her body.
Some muscles tightened while others relaxed.
Maybe these actions moved her hips or her arms.
The nervous system, working together with the muscular and skeletal systems, allowed Michelle to react to the situation.
