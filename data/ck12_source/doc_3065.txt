The head of the hammer moves farther than you move the handle with your hand.
For all machines—not just hammers—the user applies force (input force) to the machine over a certain distance (input distance).
The machine, in turn, applies force (output force) to an object, also over a certain distance (output distance).
A machine makes work easier by changing the force or the distance over which the force is applied.
What Is Mechanical Advantage?
How much a machine changes the input force is its mechanical advantage .
Mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force to the input force, so it can be represented by the equation:
Note that this equation represents the actual mechanical advantage of a machine.
The actual mechanical advantage takes into account the amount of the input force that is used to overcome friction.
The equation yields the factor by which the machine changes the input force when the machine is actually used in the real world.
Ideal Mechanical Advantage
It can be difficult to measure the input and output forces needed to calculate the actual mechanical advantage of a machine.
Generally, an unknown amount of the input force is used to overcome friction.
It’s usually easier to measure the input and output distances than the input and output forces.
The distance measurements can then be used to calculate the ideal mechanical advantage.
The ideal mechanical advantage represents the change in input force that would be achieved by the machine if there were no friction to overcome.
The ideal mechanical advantage is always greater than the actual mechanical advantage because all machines have to overcome friction.
Ideal mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation:
