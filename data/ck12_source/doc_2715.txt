Comparing change in energy between exothermic and endothermic reactions
Note: Î”H represents the change in energy.
Q:
What happens to the excess energy in the reactants of an exothermic reaction?
A:
The excess energy is generally released to the surroundings when the reaction occurs.
In a home heating system, for example, the energy that is released during combustion in the furnace is used to heat the home.
All chemical reactions involve energy.
Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products.
Endothermic reactions absorb energy, and exothermic reactions release energy.
The law of conservation of energy states that matter cannot be created or destroyed.
Whether a chemical reaction absorbs or releases energy, there is no overall change in the amount of energy during the reaction.
