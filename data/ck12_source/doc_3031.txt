If the break-dancer lies down on the ground on his back, his weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m 2 .
How much pressure does he exert on the ground in this position?
A :
On his back, the pressure he exerts is:
\text{Pressure}=\frac{800 \ \text{N}}{0.75 \ \text{m}^2}=1100 \ \text{Pa, or } 1.1 \ \text{kPa}
Factors That Affect Fluid Pressure
Two factors influence the pressure of fluids.
They are the depth of the fluid and its density.
A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths.
Deeper in a fluid, all of the fluid above it results in more weight pressing down.
This causes greater pressure the deeper you go.

Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air.
The particles of denser fluids are closer together, so there are more collisions of particles in a given area.
The difference in density of water and air is illustrated in the Figure below .
Particles of different densities exert different amounts of pressure
All fluids exert pressure because their particles are constantly moving and bumping into things.
Pressure is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area.
It measures how concentrated a force is.
