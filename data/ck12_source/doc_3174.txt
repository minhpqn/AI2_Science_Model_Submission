The wave travels down the string to the end.
The string vibrates up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave.
Crests and Troughs
A transverse wave is characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes through.
The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.
You can see both in the Figure below .
Crests and troughs of a transverse wave
Transverse waves called S waves occur during earthquakes.
The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions away from the disturbance.
S waves may travel for hundreds of miles.
An S wave is modeled in the Figure below .
Secondary waves are transverse waves
A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels.
The high points of a transverse wave are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.
S waves are transverse waves that travel through underground rocks during earthquakes.
At the following URL, review transverse waves and watch the animations.
Be sure to view the slow motion video of a transverse wave moving through a bungee cord.
Then answer the questions below.
Give two examples of transverse waves.
How can you make a transverse wave in a Slinky spring toy?
