Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are monogamous.
Usually, the parents take turns incubating the eggs.
Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid.
In polygamous species, where there is more than one mate, one parent does all of the incubating.
The wild turkey is an example of a polygamous bird.
The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different species of birds.
At one extreme, in a group of birds called the magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at hatching.
In this case, the newly-hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away.
These birds are called precocial .
Other precocial birds include the domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese.
At the other extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of time.
For example, the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive parental care for six months, or until they are ready to fly, and then take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents ( Figure below ).
These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called altricial .
In most animals, male parental care is rare.
But it is very common in birds.
Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks.
Since birds often take great care of their young, some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism.
This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in another birdâ€™s nest.
The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite bird's eggs.
