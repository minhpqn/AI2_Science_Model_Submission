We've all done that.
Taking that deep breath in is an active process.
You can usually feel your chest move.
Why?
Obviously, muscles in your chest are doing the work.
Regulation of Breathing
To understand how breathing is regulated, you first need to understand how breathing occurs.
How Breathing Occurs
Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm.
The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ).
When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward.
This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs.
With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs.
When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur.
The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon.
