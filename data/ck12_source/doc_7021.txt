Give an overview of Heat Engines and Pressure Volume diagrams.
Calculate ideal efficiencies of heat engines.
Students will learn about Heat Engines, Pressure Volume diagrams and how to calculate ideal efficiencies of heat engines.
Q_{\text{in}} = Q_{\text{out}} + W +\Delta U
U is the internal energy of the gas. (This is the first law of Thermodynamics and applies to all heat engines.)
e_c = 1-\frac{T_c}{T_h} && \text{Efficiency of a Carnot (ideal) heat engine}
where  T_c  and  T_h  are the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, respectively.
adiabatic expansion is a process occurring without the exchange of heat with the environment
isothermal expansion is a process occurring without a change in temperature
isobaric expansion is a process occurring without a change in pressure
Heat engines transform input heat into work in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics.
For instance, as we learned in the previous Concept, increasing the temperature of a gas at constant volume will increase its pressure.
This pressure can be transformed into a force that moves a piston.
The mechanics of various heat engines differ but their fundamentals are quite similar and involve the following steps:
