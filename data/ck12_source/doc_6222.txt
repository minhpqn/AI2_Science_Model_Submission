For example, you might have noticed how the "fluff" of a dandelion moves in the wind.
Each piece of fluff carries a seed to a new location.
If you look under the scales of pine cone, you will see tiny seeds with "wings" that allow these seeds to be carried away by the wind.
Maple trees also have specialized fruits with wing-like parts that help seed dispersal ( Figure below ).
Maple seeds have wings that help the wind disperse them
Maple trees have fruits with “wings” that help the wind disperse the seeds.
Some flowering plants grow fleshy fruit that helps disperse their seeds.
When animals eat the fruit, the seeds pass through an animal’s digestive tract unharmed.
The seeds germinate after they are passed out with the animal's feces.
Berries, citrus fruits, cherries, apples, and a variety of other types of fruits are all adapted to be attractive to animals, so the animals will eat them and disperse the seed ( Figure below ).
Some non-fleshy fruits are specially adapted for animals to carry them on their fur.
You might have returned from a walk in the woods to find burrs stuck to your socks.
These burrs are actually specialized fruits designed to carry seeds to a new location.
Fleshy fruits aid in seed dispersal, since animals eat the fruits and carry the seeds to a new location
Fleshy fruits aid in seed dispersal, since animals eat the fruits and carry the seeds to a new location.
The seed contains a dormant embryo and stored food.
Fruits are adapted to disperse seeds with the help of animals or the wind.
