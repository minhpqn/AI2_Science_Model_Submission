Plants may not move, but that does not mean they don't respond to their environment.
Plants can sense gravity, light, touch, and seasonal changes.
For example, you might have noticed how a house plant bends toward a bright window.
Plants can sense and then grow toward the source of light.
Scientists say that plants are able to respond to "stimuli," or something—usually in the environment—that results in a response.
For instance, light is the stimulus, and the plant moving toward the light is the "response."
Hormones are special chemical messengers molecules that help organisms, including plants, respond to stimuli in their environment.
In order for plants to respond to the environment, their cells must be able to communicate with other cells.
Hormones send messages between the cells.
Animals, like humans, also have hormones, such as testosterone or estrogen, to carry messages from cell to cell.
In both plants and animals, hormones travel from cell to cell in response to a stimulus; they also activate a specific response.
Types of Plant Hormones
Five different types of plant hormones are involved in the main responses of plants, and they each have different functions ( Table below ).
Fruit ripening and abscission
Break the dormancy of seeds and buds; promote growth
Promote cell division; prevent senescence
Close the stomata; maintain dormancy
Involved in tropisms and apical dominance
The hormone ethylene has two functions.
It (1) helps ripen fruit and (2) is involved in the process of abscission , the dropping of leaves, fruits, and flowers.
