The standard entropy change is equal to the sum of all the standard entropies of the products minus the sum of all the standard entropies of the reactants.
The symbol “ n ” signifies that each entropy must first be multiplied by its coefficient in the balanced equation.
The entropy change for the formation of liquid water from gaseous hydrogen and oxygen can be calculated using this equation:
& 2\text{H}_2(g)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \\& \Delta S^\circ=2(69.9) - [2(131.0)+1(205.0)]=-327 \ \text{J/K} \cdot \text{mol}
The entropy change for this reaction is highly negative because three gaseous molecules are being converted into two liquid molecules.
According to the drive towards higher entropy, the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen is an unfavorable reaction.
In this case, the reaction is highly exothermic and the drive towards a decrease in energy allows the reaction to occur.
Calculations of change in entropy using standard entropy are described.
