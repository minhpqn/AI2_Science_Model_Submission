Many of the applications will be discussed in the additional concepts.
PCR was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis.
Due to the importance of this process and the significance it has had on scientific research, Dr.
Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, just 10 years after his discovery.
See  for animations of Dr.
Mullis and PCR.
To say that PCR, molecular cloning and the Human Genome Project has revolutionized biology and medicine would be an understatement.
These efforts have led to numerous accolades, including Nobel prizes, and more may follow.
Some of the ways that these discoveries have shaped our lives are the focus of the Concept Biotechnology (Advanced) concepts.
annealing step :
Second step of a PCR cycle; allows oligonucleotide primers to bind to their specific site on single-strnaded DNA.
denaturation step :
First step of a PCR cycle; disrupts the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases of the DNA strands, yielding single strands of DNA.
extension step :
Third step of a PCR cycle; allows Taq polymerase to extend primer, forming double-stranded DNA.
oligonucleotide primer :
Short single-stranded piece of DNA; hydrogen bonds to a DNA strand to serve as a initiation segment for DNA polymerase to extend.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) :
A repeating series of cycles used to amplify millions of times specific regions of a DNA strand.
Taq polymerase :
