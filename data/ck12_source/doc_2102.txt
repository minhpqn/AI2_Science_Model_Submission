Solar energy is used to heat homes and water, and to make electricity.
Scientists and engineers have many ways to get energy from the Sun ( Figure above ).
One is by using solar cells.
Solar cells are devices that turn sunlight directly into electricity.
Lots of solar cells make up an individual solar panel.
You may have seen solar panels on roof tops.
The Sun’s heat can also be trapped in your home by using south facing windows and good insulation.
Consequences of Solar Energy Use
Solar energy has many benefits.
It does not produce any pollution, and there is plenty of it available—much more than we could possibly use.
But solar energy has problems.
The Sun doesn't shine at night.
A special battery is needed to store extra energy during the day for use at night.
The technology for most uses of solar energy is still expensive.
Until solar technology becomes more affordable, most people will prefer to get their energy from other sources.
Solar energy is the result of nuclear fusion in our nearest star.
A liquid is heated and moves that energy by conduction.
Solar power is expensive, but as demand increases, technology improves and costs decrease.
