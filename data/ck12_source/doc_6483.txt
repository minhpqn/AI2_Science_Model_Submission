Describe abilities of materials to participate in redox reactions based on standard cell potential data.
Galvanized nails help protect the iron with a layer of zinc
Keeping rust away
When exposed to moisture, steel will begin to rust fairly quickly.
This creates a significant problem for items like nails that are exposed to the atmosphere.
The nails can be protected by coated them with zinc metal, making a galvanized nail.
The zinc is more likely to oxidize than the iron in the steel, so it prevents rust from developing on the nail.
