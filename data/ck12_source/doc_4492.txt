Literally, the muscle fibers get smaller in size.
To understand how this happens, you need to know more about the structure of muscle fibers.
Structure of Muscle Fibers
Each muscle fiber contains hundreds of organelles called myofibrils .
Each myofibril is made up of two types of protein filaments: actin filaments, which are thinner, and myosin filaments, which are thicker.
Actin filaments are anchored to structures called Z lines (see Figure below ).
The region between two Z lines is called a sarcomere .
Within a sarcomere, myosin filaments overlap the actin filaments.
The myosin filaments have tiny structures called cross bridges that can attach to actin filaments.

A sarcomere contains actin and myosin filaments between two Z lines.
Sliding Filament Theory
The most widely accepted theory explaining how muscle fibers contract is called the sliding filament theory .
According to this theory, myosin filaments use energy from ATP to “walk” along the actin filaments with their cross bridges.
This pulls the actin filaments closer together.
The movement of the actin filaments also pulls the Z lines closer together, thus shortening the sarcomere.
You can watch this occurring in a video animation at the link below.

When all of the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the fiber contracts.
