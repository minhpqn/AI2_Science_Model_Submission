Freezing Point of a Nonelectrolyte
Ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2 ) is a molecular compound that is used in many commercial anti-freezes.
A water solution of ethylene glycol is used in vehicle radiators to lower its freezing point and thus prevent the water in the radiator from freezing.
Calculate the freezing point of a solution of 400. g of ethylene glycol in 500. g of water.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
mass C 2 H 6 O 2 = 400. g
molar mass C 2 H 6 O 2 = 62.08 g/mol
mass H 2 O = 500.0 g = 0.500 kg
\text{mass H}_2\text{O}=500.0 \ \text{g}=0.500 \ \text{kg}
T_f \ \text{of solution}=? \ ^\circ \text{C}
This is a three-step problem.
First, calculate the moles of ethylene glycol.
Then, calculate the molality of the solution.
Finally, calculate the freezing point depression.
Step 2:
Solve.
