Population pyramid represents the age and sex structure of a population
A population pyramid represents the age-sex structure of a population.
What does a large base represent?
Another way to show how deaths affect populations is with survivorship curves .
These are graphs that represent the number of individuals still alive at each age.
Examples are shown in Figure below .
Survivorship curves reflect death rates at different ages
Survivorship curves reflect death rates at different ages.
The three types of curves shown in the figure actually represent different strategies species use to adapt to their environment:
Type I:
Parents produce relatively few offspring and provide them with a lot of care.
As a result, most of the offspring survive to adulthood so they can reproduce.
This pattern is typical of large animals, including humans.
Type II:
Parents produce moderate numbers of offspring and provide some parental care.
Deaths occur more uniformly throughout life.
This pattern occurs in some birds and many asexual species.
Type III:
Parents produce many offspring but provide them with little or no care.
As a result, relatively few offspring survive to adulthood.
