The double helix shape forms naturally and is very strong, making the two polynucleotide chains difficult to break apart.
How DNA folds into chromosomes
DNA Molecule.
Bonds between complementary bases help form the double helix of a DNA molecule.
The letters A, T, G, and C stand for the bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine.
The sequence of these four bases in DNA is a code that carries instructions for making proteins.
Shown is how the DNA winds into a chromosome.

Roles of Nucleic Acids
DNA is also known as the hereditary material or genetic information.
It is found in genes, and its sequence of bases makes up a code.
Between "starts" and "stops," the code carries instructions for the correct sequence of amino acids in a protein (see Figure below ).
DNA and RNA have different functions relating to the genetic code and proteins.
Like a set of blueprints, DNA contains the genetic instructions for the correct sequence of amino acids in proteins.
RNA uses the information in DNA to assemble the correct amino acids and help make the protein.
The information in DNA is passed from parent cells to daughter cells whenever cells divide.
The information in DNA is also passed from parents to offspring when organisms reproduce.
This is how inherited characteristics are passed from one generation to the next.
RNA codon and protein sequence
The letters G, U, C, and A stand for the bases in RNA.
