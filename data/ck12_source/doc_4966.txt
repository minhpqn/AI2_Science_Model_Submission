juxtacrine signaling :
Cell communication via direct contact.
neurotransmitter :
Chemical messages which are released at the synapse; relay the message/signal onto the next neuron or other type of cell.
paracrine signaling :
Cell communication over short distances.
Cell communication or cell signaling describes how cells share information.
Cell communication usually begins when a molecule (a ligand) binds to its receptor.
Cell communication can be over short or long distances.
