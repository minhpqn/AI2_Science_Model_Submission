When the temperature of a substance is changing, we can use the specific heat to determine the amount of heat that is being gained or lost.
When a substance is changing phase, we can use the heat of fusion or heat of vaporization to determine the amount of heat being gained or lost.
When a substance freezes from liquid to solid, the amount of heat given off is exactly the same as the amount of heat absorbed when the substance melts from solid to liquid.
The equations for heat gained or lost are given here:
The heat gained or lost during a temperature change:  Q = mc \Delta t
The heat gained or lost during a phase change of solid to liquid:
Q = mH_f .
The heat gained or lost during a phase change of liquid to gas:
Q = mH_v .
Example Problem: 5000.
Joules of heat is added to ice at 273 K.
All the heat goes into changing solid ice into liquid water.
How much ice is melted?
Solution: m=\frac{Q}{H_f}=\frac{5000 \ J}{3.34 \times 10^5 \ J/kg}=0.0150 \ kg
