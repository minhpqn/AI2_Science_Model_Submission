Molecular crystals, such as ice, have relatively low melting points and weak intermolecular forces
Ice crystal structure.
Ionic crystals are composed of alternating positive and negative ions.
Metallic crystals consist of metal cations surrounded by a “sea” of mobile valence electrons.
Covalent crystals are composed of atoms which are covalently bonded to one another.
Molecular crystals are held together by weak intermolecular forces.
