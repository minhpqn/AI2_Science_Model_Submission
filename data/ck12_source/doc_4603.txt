Antigens are also found on cancer cells and the cells of transplanted organs.
They trigger the immune system to react against the cells that carry them.
This is why a transplanted organ may be rejected by the recipient’s immune system.
How do B and T cells recognize specific antigens?
They have receptor molecules on their surface that bind only with particular antigens.
As shown in Figure below , the fit between an antigen and a matching receptor molecule is like a key in a lock.
Antigen receptor interaction
An antigen fits the matching receptor molecule like a key in a lock.
The body’s third line of defense is the immune response.
This involves the lymphatic system.
This system filters pathogens from lymph and produces lymphocytes.
Lymphocytes are the key cells in the immune response.
They are leukocytes that become activated by a particular antigen.
There are two major type of lymphocytes:
B cells and T cells.
