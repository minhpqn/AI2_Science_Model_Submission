Animals that have backbones are known as vertebrates.
Introduction to Vertebrates
Vertebrates are animals with backbones.
These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
Characteristics of Vertebrates
The primary feature shared by all vertebrates is the vertebral column , or backbone.
The vertebral column protects the spinal cord.
Other typical vertebrate traits include:
The cranium (skull) to protect the brain.
The brain is attached to the spinal cord.
An internal skeleton.
The internal skeleton supports the animal, protects internal organs, and allows for movement.
A defined head region with a brain.
The head region has an accumulation of sense organs.
Living vertebrates range in size from a carp species, as little as 0.3 inches, to the blue whale, which can be as large as 110 feet ( Figure below ).
Comparison of the size of a whale, carp, and human
A species of carp and an image of the blue whale (a mammal), the largest living vertebrate, reaching up to 110 feet long.
Shown below it is the smallest whale species, Hector's dolphin (about 5 feet in length), and beside it is a human.
These images are not to scale.
The carp is greatly exaggerated in size and is even smaller than depicted when compared to the blue whale.
