Why does a helium-filled balloon gradually sink?
What does temperature have to do with gas kinetic energies?
diffusion:
The tendency of molecules to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is uniform.
effusion:
The process of a confined gas escaping through a tiny hole in its container.
Grahamâ€™s law:
The rate of effusion or diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas.
