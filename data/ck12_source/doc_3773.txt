They became the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells.
Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
What is the evidence for this evolutionary pathway?
Biochemistry and electron microscopy provide convincing support.
The mitochondria and chloroplasts within our eukaryotic cells share the following features with prokaryotic cells:
Their organelle DNA is short and circular, and the DNA sequences do not match DNA sequences found in the nucleus.
Molecules that make up organelle membranes resemble those in prokaryotic membranes – and differ from those in eukaryotic membranes.
Ribosomes in these organelles are similar to those of bacterial ribosomes, and different from eukaryotic ribosomes.
Reproduction is by binary fission, not by mitosis.
Biochemical pathways and structures show closer relationships to prokaryotes.
Two or more membranes surround these organelles.
The "host" cell membrane and biochemistry are more similar to those of Archaebacteria, so scientists believe eukaryotes descended more directly from that major group ( Figure below ).
The timing of this dramatic evolutionary event (more likely a series of events) is not clear.
The oldest fossil clearly related to modern eukaryotes is a red alga dating back to 1.2 billion years ago.
However, many scientists place the appearance of eukaryotic cells at about 2 billion years.
Some time within Proterozoic Eon, then, all three major groups of life – Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes – became well established.
What Does it all Mean?
Eukaryotic cells, made possible by endosymbiosis, were powerful and efficient.
That power and efficiency gave them the potential to evolve new characteristics: multicellularity, cell specialization, and large size.
They were the key to the spectacular diversity of animals, plants, and fungi that populate our world today.
