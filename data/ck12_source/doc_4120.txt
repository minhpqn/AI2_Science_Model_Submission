Darwin drew this version of the “Tree of Life” on the left to represent how species evolve and diverge into separate directions.
Each point on the tree where one branch splits off from another represents the common ancestor of the species on the separate branches.
Scientists have drawn many different versions of the “Tree of Life” to show different features of evolution.
The Tree of Life on the right was made by Ernst Haeckel in 1879.
