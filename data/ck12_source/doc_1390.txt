People in earthquake-prone regions must be aware of the potential damage from earthquakes.
Seismologists have scales for measuring earthquake intensity and magnitude.
Cities in earthquake zones must build safe structures.
They also have guidelines for being safe in earthquakes.
Earthquakes are often associated with volcanoes.
Volcanoes erupt at all types of plate boundaries except transform.
Volcanic eruptions can be quiet or explosive.
Volcanoes have a variety of shapes.
The shapes range from large shields, to classic peaks, to small cones.
Supervolcano eruptions are rare but extremely deadly.
Volcanic activity creates unique landforms.
Hot springs and geysers result when water meets hot rock below ground.
Some geological activity, both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, is located away from plate boundaries.
