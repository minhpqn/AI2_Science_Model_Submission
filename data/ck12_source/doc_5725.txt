Each occupied sublevel designation is written followed by a superscript that is the number of electrons in that sublevel.
Define valence electron.
Be able to indicate valence electrons when given the electron configuration for an atom.
Chemical reaction of iodine
What makes a particular element very reactive and another element non-reactive?
A chemical reaction involves either electron removal, electron addition, or electron sharing.
The path a specific element will take depends on where the electrons are in the atom and how many there are.

In the study of chemical reactivity, we will find that the electrons in the outermost principal energy level are very important and so they are given a special name.
Valence electrons are the electrons in the highest occupied principal energy level of an atom.
In the second period elements listed above, the two electrons in the 1 s sublevel are called inner-shell electrons and are not involved directly in the elementâ€™s reactivity or in the formation of compounds.
Lithium has a single electron in the second principal energy level and so we say that lithium has one valence electron.
