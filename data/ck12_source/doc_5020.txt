A pathway which traces energy flow through an ecosystem.
heterotroph :
Organisms which must consume organic molecules; also known as a consumer.
inorganic molecule :
Molecule which does not contain carbon (with a few exceptions such as carbon dioxide); a molecule not necessarily made by living organisms.
organic molecule :
A molecule which contains carbon, made by living organisms; examples include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.
photosynthesis :
The process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose and oxygen, using sunlight for energy.
phototroph :
An organism that captures light energy from the sun and converts it into chemical energy inside their cell.
producer :
Organism that produces organic compounds from energy and simple inorganic molecules; an autotroph.
Food is chemical energy stored in organic molecules.
Food provides both the energy to do life’s work and the carbon to build life’s bodies.
Autotrophs make their own carbohydrate foods, transforming sunlight in photosynthesis or transferring chemical energy from inorganic molecules in chemosynthesis.
Heterotrophs consume organic molecules originally made by autotrophs.
All life depends absolutely upon autotrophs to make food molecules.
Water and carbon dioxide molecules are reactants in the process of photosynthesis.
Does this mean they are “food” for plants, algae, and blue-green bacteria?
