A protein has one subunit.
Would it have a quaternary structure?
polypeptide:
A sequence of amino acids between ten and one hundred in length.
primary structure:
The amino acid sequence of the protein.
protein:
A peptide that is greater than one hundred amino acids in length.
quaternary structure:
The specific interaction and orientation of the subunits of that protein.
secondary structure:
A highly regular sub-structure of the protein.
tertiary structure:
The overall three-dimensional structure of the protein.
Define active site.
Describe the process of an enzyme reaction.
Describe the process by which a competitive inhibitor alters the rate of an enzyme reaction.
Describe the process by which a non-competitive inhibitor alters the rate of an enzyme reaction.
