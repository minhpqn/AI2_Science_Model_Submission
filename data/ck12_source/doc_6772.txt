Analyze and solve more complicated problems involving energy conservation.
Students will learn how to analyze and solve more complicated problems involving energy conservation.
\sum E_{\text{initial}} = \sum E_{\text{final} } ;
The total energy does not change in closed systems
KE = \frac{1}{2} \ mv^2 ;
Kinetic energy
PE_g = mgh ;
Potential energy of gravity
PE_{sp} = \frac{1}{2} \ kx^2  ;
Potential energy of a spring
W = F_{x} \Delta x = Fd \ \cos \theta ;
Work is equal to the distance multiplied by the component of the force in the direction it is moving.
Guidance The main thing to always keep prescient in your mind is that the total energy before must equal the total energy after.
If some energy has transferred out of or into the system via work, you calculate that work done and include it in the energy sum equation.
Generally work done by friction is listed on the 'after' side and work put into the system, via a jet pack for example, goes on the 'before' side.
Another important point is that on turns or going over hills or in rollercoaster loops, one must include the centripetal motion equations -for example to insure that you have enough speed to make the loop.
