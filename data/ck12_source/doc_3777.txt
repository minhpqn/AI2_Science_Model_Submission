These adaptations included sexual reproduction , specialization of cells, and multicellularity .
Sexual reproduction created much more variety among offspring.
This increased the chances that at least some of them would survive when the environment changed.
It also increased the speed at which evolution could occur.
Some cells started to live together in colonies.
In some colonies, cells started to specialize in doing different jobs.
This made the cells more efficient as a colony than as individual cells.
By 1 billion years ago, the first multicellular organisms had evolved.
They may have developed from colonies of specialized cells.
Their cells were so specialized they could no longer survive independently.
However, together they were mighty.
They formed an organism that was bigger, more efficient, and able to do much more than any single-celled organism ever could.
The Precambrian Extinction
At the close of the Precambrian 544 million years ago, a mass extinction occurred.
In a mass extinction , many or even most species abruptly disappear from Earth.
There have been five mass extinctions in Earthâ€™s history.
Many scientists think we are currently going through a sixth mass extinction.
What caused the Precambrian mass extinction?
A combination of climatic and geologic events was probably responsible.
No matter what the cause, the extinction paved the way for a burst of new life, called the Cambrian explosion, during the following Paleozoic Era.
