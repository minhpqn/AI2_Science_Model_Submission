Frogs and Toads
Frogs and toads are amphibians in the order Anura.
In terms of classification, there is actually not a big difference between frogs and toads.
Frogs often have long legs that are good for hopping, skin that is smooth and moist, and special pads on their toes that help them climb.
Toads are more heavyset with shorter legs, and usually have drier skin, often with warty-looking bumps.
Frogs are more likely to live in or near water than toads.
