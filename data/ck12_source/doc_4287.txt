Life cycle of the sheep liver fluke
Life Cycle of the Sheep Liver Fluke.
The sheep liver fluke has a complicated life cycle with two hosts.
How could such a complicated way of life evolve?
Tapeworms and flukes have suckers and other structures for feeding on a host.
Tapeworms also have a scolex , a ring of hooks on their head to attach themselves to the host (see Figure below ).
Unlike other invertebrates, tapeworms lack a mouth and digestive system.
Instead, they absorb nutrients directly from the host’s digestive system with their suckers.
Tapeworm suckers and hooks
Tapeworm Suckers and Hooks.
The head of a tapeworm has several suckers.
At the very top of the head is a “crown” of hooks called a scolex.
Not all flatworms are parasites.
Some are free-living carnivores.
They eat other small invertebrates and decaying animals.
Most of the free-living species live in aquatic habitats, but some live in moist soil.
Platyhelminthes are flatworms such as tapeworms and flukes.
Flatworms have a mesoderm cell layer and simple organ systems.
They also show cephalization and bilateral symmetry.
Many flatworms are parasites with vertebrate hosts.
