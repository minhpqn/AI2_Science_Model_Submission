A ship sends out sound waves to create a picture of the seafloor below it.
The echo sounder pictured has many beams, and, as a result, it creates a three dimensional map of the seafloor beneath the ship.
Early echo sounders had only a single beam and created a line of depth measurements.
Features of the Seafloor
Scientists expected the seafloor to be flat and featureless.
So they were shocked by what they saw: tremendous topographical features like mountain ranges, rifts, and trenches.
Oceanographic research vessels continue to map the seafloor as they sail across the seas today.
The map below is a modern map with data from several decades.
The major features of the ocean basins and their colors on the map include:
mid-ocean ridges :
A long chain of mountains that rises up high above the deep seafloor.
An example is the light blue gash in middle of Atlantic Ocean.
Light blue is higher elevation than dark blue.
rift zones:
In the middle of the mid-ocean ridges is a rift zone.
The rift cuts the ridge into pieces.
It is lower in elevation than the mountains of the mid-ocean ridge.
deep sea trenches :
Trenches are found in the sea.
Some are near the edges of continents.
