When air cools, it can hold less water vapor, so some of the water vapor in the air changed to liquid water.
The process in which water vapor—or another gas—changes to a liquid is called condensation .
Another common example of condensation is pictured in the Figure below .

Condensation trail behind a jet
This picture shows the contrail ( con densation trail ) left behind by a jet.
Water vapor in its exhaust gases condensed on dust particles in the air.
When air is very humid, it doesn’t have to cool very much for water vapor in the air to start condensing.
The temperature at which condensation occurs is called the dew point.
The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content.
It is always less than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister air have dew points closer to the actual air temperature.
That’s why glasses of cold drinks “sweat” more on a hot, humid day than they do on a cool, dry day.

Q:
What happens when air temperature reaches the dew point?
A:
When air temperature reaches the dew point, water vapor starts condensing.
It may form dew (as on the spider web in the opening image), clouds, or fog.
Dew forms on solid objects on the ground.
Clouds form on tiny particles in the air high above the ground.
