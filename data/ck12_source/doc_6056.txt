The boiling points of various liquids can be illustrated in a vapor pressure curve ( Figure below ).
A vapor pressure curve is a graph of vapor pressure as a function of temperature.
To find the normal boiling point of a liquid, a horizontal line is drawn from the left at a pressure equal to standard pressure.
At whatever temperature that line intersects the vapor pressure curve of a liquid is the boiling point of that liquid.
Vapor pressure curves of various substances
Vapor pressure curves.
The boiling points of liquid also correlate to the strength of the intermolecular forces.
Recall that diethyl ether has weak dispersion forces, which meant that the liquid has a high vapor pressure.
The weak forces also mean that it does not require a large an input of energy to make diethyl ether boil and so it has a relatively low normal boiling point of 34.6°C.
Water, with its much stronger hydrogen bonding, has a low vapor pressure and a higher normal boiling point of 100°C.
As stated earlier, boiling points are affected by external pressure.
At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower.
With less pressure pushing down on the surface of the liquid, it boils at a lower temperature.
This can also be seen from the vapor pressure curves.
If one draws a horizontal line at a lower vapor pressure, it intersects each curve at a lower temperature.
The boiling point of water is 100°C at sea level, where the atmospheric pressure is standard.
In Denver, Colorado at 1600 m above sea level, the atmospheric pressure is about 640 mmHg and water boils at about 95°C.
On the summit of Mt.
Everest the atmospheric pressure is about 255 mmHg and water boils at only 70°C.
On the other hand, water boils at greater than 100°C if the external pressure is higher than standard.
