A:
You should be exposed to a 100-dB sound for no longer than 15 minutes.
An example of a sound this intense is the sound of a car horn.
Hearing loss caused by loud sounds is permanent.
However, this type of hearing loss can be prevented by protecting the ears from loud sounds.
People who work in jobs that expose them to loud sounds must wear hearing protectors.
Examples include construction workers who work around loud machinery for many hours each day.
But anyone exposed to loud sounds for longer than the permissible exposure time should wear hearing protectors.
Many home and yard chores and even recreational activities are loud enough to cause hearing loss if people are exposed to them for too much time.
You can see examples in the Figure below .
Sources of loud noises
These activities expose people to dangerously loud sounds that can cause hearing loss.
How Hearing Protectors Work
You can see two different types of hearing protectors in the Figure below .
Earplugs are simple hearing protectors that just muffle sounds by partially blocking all sound waves from entering the ears.
This type of hearing protector is suitable for lower noise levels, such as the noise of a lawnmower or snowmobile.
Electronic ear protectors work differently.
They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction.
This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero.
This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss.
