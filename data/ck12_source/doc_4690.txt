Science is an ongoing process of testing and evaluation, and is guided by a universal set of principles.
One of the intended lessons of "Goals of Science" is for you to become more familiar with the scientific process.
Humans are naturally interested in the world we live in.
Young children constantly pose the question "why".
The goal of science is to answer these question .
You may not realize it, but you are performing experiments all the time.
For example, when you shop for groceries, you may end up carrying out a type of scientific experiment ( Figure below ).
If you know you like Brand X of salad dressing but Brand Y is on sale, perhaps you will try Brand Y.
If you end up liking Brand Y, you may buy it again even when it is not on sale.
If you did not like Brand Y, not even a sale would entice you into buying it again.
Your conclusions are essentially based on an experiment.
To find out why a person might prefer a salad dressing over another, you might examine the cost, ingredient list, or packaging of the two salad dressings.
An experiment does not have to involve laboratory equipment; it can be as simple as trying new items while shopping
Shopping sometimes involves a little scientific experimentation.
You are interested in inventing a new type of salad that you can pack for lunch.
You might buy a vegetable or salad dressing that you have not tried before to discover if it would make an appealing addition to your salad.
If you like it, you will probably buy it again.
This is a type of experiment in which you have discovered a liking for something new.
There are many different areas of science, or scientific disciplines , but all scientific study involves:
relying on evidence to form conclusions
