Oxygen in Reactions
Define oxidation and reduction.
Describe oxidation-reduction reactions involving oxygen.
Peroxides are used to bleach teeth to a sparkling white color
Before (top) and after (bottom) teeth bleaching.
Are our teeth sparkling white?
Are they attractive?
We worry a lot about our smiles.
Over the years teeth do discolor some, so the procedure of teeth bleaching has become more and more popular.
Best done in a dentist’s office, various chemical preparations containing peroxides are used to whiten the teeth.
Less effective, but easier to use are “teeth-whitening” tooth pastes (also containing peroxides) that promise to give you a brighter smile and improve your life in every way.
Oxygen in Reactions
Many elements simply combine with oxygen to form the oxide of that element.
The heating of magnesium in air allows it to combine with oxygen from the air to form magnesium oxide (see video below).
2\text{Mg}(s)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{MgO}(s)

Compounds can also react with oxygen, possibly creating oxides of more than one element.
When methane burns, carbon dioxide and water are produced.
\text{CH}_4(g)+2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
Carbon dioxide is an oxide of carbon, while water is an oxide of hydrogen.
