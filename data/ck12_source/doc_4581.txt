Each food group represented by a colored band in MyPyramid is a good source of nutrients.
The key in Figure above shows the food group each band represents.
The wider the band, the more you should eat from that food group.
The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods that should be eaten only once in a while, such as ice cream and potato chips.
They contain few nutrients and may contribute excess Calories to the diet.
The figure “walking” up the side of MyPyramid represents the role of physical activity in balanced eating.
Regular exercise helps you burn any extra energy that you consume in foods and provides many other health benefits.
You should be active for about an hour a day most days of the week.
The more active you are, the more energy you will use.
In June 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture replaced My Pyramid with MyPlate.
MyPlate depicts the relative daily portions of various food groups.
See  for further information.
MyPlate is a visual guideline for balanced eating, replacing MyPyramid in 2011.
The following guidelines accompany MyPlate:
Enjoy your food, but eat less.
Avoid oversized portions.
Foods to Increase
