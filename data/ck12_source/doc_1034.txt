Errors are often unavoidable.
This is called experimental error .
Errors may be due to the equipment being used.
In this case, the numbers may be always skewed in one direction.
For example, a scale may always measure one-half of an ounce high.
People can also make errors.
A measurement may not be made precisely.
For example, a stopwatch may be stopped too soon or too late.
But probably not always in the same direction.
To correct for this, many measurements are taken.
The measurements are then averaged.
Experiments always have a margin of error associated with them.
Testing a hypothesis requires data.
Data can be gathered by observations or by experiments.
Observations can be done simply by looking at and measuring a phenomenon.
Observations can also be done by using advanced technology.
Experiments must be well-designed.
They must be done under controlled conditions.
Only one variable should be manipulated.
Errors are always possible in human endeavors.
