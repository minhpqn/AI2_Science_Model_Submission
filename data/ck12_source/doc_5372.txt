The ribosome has three tRNA binding sites: the A site, the P site, and the E site ( Figure below ).
The A site binds a tRNA with an attached amino acid.
The P site contains the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain attached, and the E site contains the tRNA that no longer has an attached amino acid.
This tRNA is preparing to exit the ribosome.
A single mRNA can be translated simultaneously by multiple ribosomes.
For an animation of translation, see
This cartoon depicts the relative location of the E, P, and A sites within the ribosome.
The A site binds a tRNA bound to an amino acid, the P site binds a tRNA bound to the polypeptide being synthesized, and the E site binds a tRNA without an attached amino acid before the tRNA exits the ribosome.
Role of tRNA
Transfer RNAs or tRNAs bring or tansfer the proper amino acid to the ribosome based on the genetic code.
The anticodon at the bottom of the tRNA molecule binds to the codon on the mRNA.
The codon on the mRNA is specific for an amino acid or stop codon.
Stop codons do not have corresponding tRNA molecules, and signify the end of translation.
The amino acid is attached to the 3' end of the tRNA.
Only one amino acid can be attached to a tRNA, based on that tRNA's anticodon.
Because there are 61 separate codons (actually 64, but three are stop codons) that can bind to anticodons, there must be 61 different tRNAs in a cell.
The covalent attachment of an amino acid to the tRNA is catalyzed by enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA syntheses through a process called aminoacylation.
Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, through aminoacylation, produces aminoacyl-tRNA molecules with an amino acid attached to their 3- ends.
There is a single aminoacyl tRNA synthetase for each amino acid.
This process is also known as "charging" the tRNA with the amino acid.
