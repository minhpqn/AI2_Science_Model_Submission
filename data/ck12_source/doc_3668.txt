Punnett square cross between two heterozygotes
This Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygotes, Bb.
Do you know where each letter (allele) in all four cells comes from?
Two pea plants, both heterozygous for flower color, are crossed.
The offspring will show the dominant purple coloration in a 3:1 ratio.
Or, about 75% of the offspring will be purple.
Predicting Offspring Genotypes
In the cross shown in Figure above , you can see that one out of four offspring (25 percent) has the genotype BB , one out of four (25 percent) has the genotype bb , and two out of four (50 percent) have the genotype Bb .
These percentages of genotypes are what you would expect in any cross between two heterozygous parents.
Of course, when just four offspring are produced, the actual percentages of genotypes may vary by chance from the expected percentages.
However, if you considered hundreds of such crosses and thousands of offspring, you would get very close to the expected results, just like tossing a coin.
Predicting Offspring Phenotypes
You can predict the percentages of phenotypes in the offspring of this cross from their genotypes.
B is dominant to b , so offspring with either the BB or Bb genotype will have the purple-flower phenotype.
Only offspring with the bb genotype will have the white-flower phenotype.
Therefore, in this cross, you would expect three out of four (75 percent) of the offspring to have purple flowers and one out of four (25 percent) to have white flowers.
