Type of Metamorphosis
Only difference between adult and larvae (young or non-adult insects) is size.
Occurs in the most primitive insects.
Newborn insect looks like a tiny version of the adult.
Silverfish, firebrats, springtails
Three stages: egg, nymph, and adult.
Young, called nymphs , usually similar to adult.
Growth occurs during the nymph stage.
Wings then appear as buds on nymphs or early forms.
When last molt is completed, wings expand to full adult size.
Dragonflies, grasshoppers, mantids, cockroaches, termites
Most insects undergo this type.
Each stage of the life cycle—egg, larva, pupa, and adult—looks different from the others.
Immature and adult stages have different forms, have different behaviors, and live in different habitats.
Immature form is called larvae and remains similar in form but increases in size.
Larvae usually have chewing mouthparts even if adult mouthparts are sucking ones.
At last larval stage of development, insect forms into pupa ( Figure below ) and does not eat or move.
During pupa stage, wing development begins, after which the adult emerges.
Butterflies, moths, flies, ants, bees, beetles
