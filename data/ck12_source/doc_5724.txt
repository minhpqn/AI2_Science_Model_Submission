Since there are three 2 p orbitals and each orbital holds two electrons, the 2 p sublevel is filled after six elements.
The Table below shows the electron configurations of the elements in the second period.
Electron Configurations of Second-Period Elements

1 s 2 2 s 2
1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 1
1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 2
1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 3
1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 4
1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 5
1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6
Electron configuration notation simplifies the indication of where electrons are located in a specific atom.
Superscripts are used to indicate the number of electrons in a given sublevel.
