Women are also under-represented in science, especially physical sciences such as chemistry and physics.
What explains this?
Throughout history, women—and also people of color of both genders—have rarely had the same chances as white males for education and careers in science.
Cultural, social, and economic biases have made it far harder for them than for white males to excel in this area.
This explains why there have been fewer scientists among their ranks.
Contributions of Women and People of Color
Despite their relative lack of opportunities, women and people of color have made many important contributions to science.
Several have won Nobel prizes for their discoveries.
Just a few of their contributions to physical science are presented in Table below .
