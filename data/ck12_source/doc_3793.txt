Create a taxonomy, modeled on the Linnaean classification system, for a set of common objects, such as motor vehicles, tools, or office supplies.
Identify the groupings that correspond to the different taxa in the Linnaean system.
Describe phylogenetic classification.
Interpret a phylogenetic tree and cladogram.
Distinguish phylogenetic classification from Linnaean classification.
Can two different species be related?
Of course they can.
For example, there are many different species of mammals, or of one type of mammal, such as mice.
And they are all related.
In other words, how close or how far apart did they separate from a common ancestor during evolution?
Determining how different species are evolutionarily related can be a tremendous task.
