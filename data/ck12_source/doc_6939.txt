Students will learn how to properly think about efficiency and how to calculate the efficiency of electrical devices.
P = V \cdot I  ;
Power in electricity is the voltage multiplied by the current
E = P \cdot \Delta t \;  ; the electrical energy used is equal to the power dissipated multiplied by the time the circuit is running
Eff = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}  ;
Efficiency is the Power out divided by the Power input
Assuming same time periods:
Eff = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}} = \frac{Work}{E_{in}}
Conservation of Energy & Electrical Efficiency:
Electrical energy is useful to us mostly because it is easy to transport and can be easily converted to or from other forms of energy.
Of course, conversion involves waste, typically as heat.
Electrical energy consumed can be determined by multiplying power by time (E = P \Delta t) .
Recall the equations for mechanical and thermal energy/work (PE=mgh, KE=1/2mv^2, Q=mc \Delta T) .
An important idea is the efficiency of an electrical device: the fraction of electrical energy consumed that goes into doing useful work (E_{out}/E_{in}) , expressed as a percentage.
You use a 100 W electric motor to lift a 10 kg mass 5 m, and it takes 20 s.
The electrical energy consumed is E_{elec} = P \cdot t = (100 \ W) (20 \ s) = 2000 \ J
The work done is against gravity, so we use PE = mgh = (10 \ kg) (10 \ m/s^2) (5 \ m) = 500 \ J
The efficiency is E_{out}/E_{in} = (500 \ J) / (2000 \ J) = 0.25 = 25\% \ \text{efficient}
