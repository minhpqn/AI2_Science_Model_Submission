Rutherford’s model proved to be an important step towards a full understanding of the atom.
However, it did not completely address the nature of the electrons and the way in which they occupied the vast space around the nucleus.
It was not until some years later that a full understanding of the electron was achieved.
This proved to be the key to understanding the chemical properties of elements.

Bombardment of gold foil with alpha particles showed that some particles were deflected.
The nuclear model of the atom consists of a small and dense positively charged interior surrounded by a cloud of electrons.
Use the link below to answer the following questions:
How thick was the gold foil?
What alpha source did he use?
How many were deflected straight back?
What was one drawback of Rutherford’s theory?
When did Rutherford and coworkers carry out their research?
What is an alpha particle?
How did Rutherford explain the observation that most alpha particles went straight through the gold foil?
What did he say about the particles that were deflected?
Describe Rutherford’s nuclear model.
alpha particle:
A type of natural radioactive particle, are positively charged particles with a mass about four times that of a hydrogen atom.
