List examples of metamorphic rocks.
Compare and contrast the two types of metamorphism.

Metamorphic Rock Classification
List and describe common metamorphic rocks.
What's the difference in these two rocks?
The rock on the left was the sedimentary rock shale.
Now it's the metamorphic rock slate.
Slate looks very similar to shale, but harder and more platy.
The rock on the right is gneiss.
The light and dark minerals have separated into bands.
Gneiss is produced by higher temperature metamorphism.
The original rock was different in both cases.
