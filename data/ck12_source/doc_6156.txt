The probability of rolling the 6 would remain the same, as would the probability of choosing the card.
Going back to our Venn diagrams, independent events are represented as those events that occur in both sets.
If we look just at Example 2, event A is randomly choosing a student holding a part-time job, and event B is randomly choosing a student on the honor roll.
These 2 events are independent of each other.
In other words, whether you hold a part-time job is not dependent on your being on the honor roll, or vice versa.
The outcome of one event is not dependent on the outcome of the second event.
To calculate the probability, you would look at the overlapping part of the diagram.
The region representing A and B is the probability of both events occurring.
Let’s look at a specific example.
In ABC High School, 30 percent of the students have a part-time job, and 25 percent of the students from the high school are on the honor roll.
Event A represents randomly choosing a student holding a part-time job.
Event B represents randomly choosing a student on the honor roll.
What is the probability of both events occurring?
Event A is randomly choosing a student holding a part-time job, and event B is randomly choosing a student on the honor roll.
These 2 events are independent of each other.
In other words, whether you hold a part-time job is not dependent on your being on the honor roll, or vice versa.
The outcome of one event is not dependent on the outcome of the second event.
To calculate the probability, you would look at the overlapping part of the Venn diagram.
The region representing A and B is the probability of both events occurring.
Let’s look at the probability calculation, which is done with the Multiplication Rule:
