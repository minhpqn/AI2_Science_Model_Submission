Why?
Viruses are usually considered to be nonliving.
Viruses do not meet most of the criteria of life.
They are not even made of cells.

A virus is a sub-microscopic particle that can infect living cells.
Viruses are much smaller than prokaryotes, ranging in size from about 20–300 nanometers (nm), though some can be larger.
Prokaryotes are typically 0.5–5.0 micrometres (µm) in length.
For example, if a virus was about the size of three soccer balls lying side-by-side, then a prokaryote would be about the size of soccer field.
An individual virus is called a virion.
It is a tiny particle much smaller than a prokaryotic cell.
Because viruses do not consist of cells, they also lack cell membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and other cell organelles.
Without these structures, they are unable to make proteins or even reproduce on their own.
Instead, they must depend on a host cell to synthesize their proteins and to make copies of themselves.
Although viruses are not classified as living things, they share two important traits with living things.
They have genetic material, and they can evolve.
This is why the classification of viruses has been controversial.
It calls into question just what it means to be alive.
