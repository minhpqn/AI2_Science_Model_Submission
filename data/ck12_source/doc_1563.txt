Heating and Global Winds
Earth is hottest at the Equator and gets cooler toward the poles.
The differences in heating create huge convection currents in the troposphere.
At the Equator, for example, warm air rises up to the tropopause.
When it can’t rise any higher, it flows north or south.
By the time the moving air reaches 30°N or °S latitude, it has cooled somewhat.
The cool air sinks to the surface.
Then it flows over the surface back to the Equator.
Other global winds occur in much the same way.
There are three enormous convection cells north of the Equator and three south of the Equator.
Global Winds and the Coriolis Effect
Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface.
This causes the Coriolis effect.
Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface due to Coriolis effect.
From which direction do the northern trade winds blow?
Without the Coriolis effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north.
But the Coriolis effect makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere.
The winds blow northwest to southeast or the reverse in the Southern Hemisphere.
The wind belts have names.
The Trade Winds are nearest the Equator.
