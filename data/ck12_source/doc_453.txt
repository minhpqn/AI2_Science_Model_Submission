The Urinary System
Sometimes, the urinary system ( Figure below ) is called the excretory system.
But the urinary system is only one part of the excretory system.
Recall that the excretory system is also made up of the skin, lungs, and large intestine, as well as the kidneys.
The urinary system is the organ system that makes, stores, and gets rid of urine.
