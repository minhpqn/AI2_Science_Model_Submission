Energy that is let off when the atom of a nucleus is split.
radiant energy:
Energy of electromagnetic radiation.
This is the topic of the concept "Solar Energy on Earth."
sound energy:
Energy from sound waves.
thermal energy:
Also called heat.
Conservation of Energy
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
It can change form.
For example, a piece of wood has chemical energy stored in its molecules.
When the wood burns, the chemical energy changes to heat energy and light energy.
Lightning converts electric potential energy into three kinds of energy.
They are light energy, sound energy, and thermal energy.
You convert food energy to movement ( Figure below ).
That's another way energy is transferred from one form to another!
This apple is a source of energy
If the girl eats this apple it will provide the energy needed for her to run.
