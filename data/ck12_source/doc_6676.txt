Displacement is a vector quantity (direction matters), where as distance is a scalor (only the amount matters).
Distance and displacement are the same in the case where the object travels in a straight line and always moving in the same direction.
Problem:
An indecisive car goes 120 m North, then 30 m south then 60m North.
What is the car's distance and displacement?
Distance is the total amount traveled.
Thus distance = 120 + 30 + 60 m = 210 m
Displacement is the amount displaced from the starting position.
Thus displacement = 120 - 30 + 60 m = 150 m.
Problem:
An 8^{\text{th}} grader is timed to run 24 feet in 12 seconds, what is her speed in meters per second?
D & = vt\\\24 \ ft & = v(12 \ s)\\\ v & = 24 \ ft/12 \ s = 2 \ ft/s\\\v & = 2 \ ft/s \ast (1 m/3.28 \ ft) = 0.61 \ m/s
