For example, during a fight-or-flight response, dilation and constriction of blood vessels allow more blood to flow to skeletal muscles and less to flow to digestive organs.
Dilation of blood vessels in the skin allows more blood to flow to the body surface so the body can lose heat.
Constriction of these blood vessels has the opposite effect and helps conserve body heat.
Blood Vessels and Blood Pressure
The force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels is called blood pressure .
Blood pressure is highest in arteries and lowest in veins.
When you have your blood pressure checked, it is the blood pressure in arteries that is measured.
High blood pressure, or hypertension , is a serious health risk but can often be controlled with lifestyle changes or medication.
You can learn more about hypertension by watching the animation at this link:
