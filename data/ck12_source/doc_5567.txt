What do you need to start building a house?
When building a house, you start with a blueprint of what the house will look like.  The plan states how many windows and what kind, how many doors and what style, how many rooms and what type (bedroom, kitchen, other).  The blueprint shows how the different pieces will go together to make the house.  As long as the blueprint is followed and exactly the same items are used, the houses will be identical.
