For example, the Borana people in Africa use birds to guide them to honey that they use in food.
Birds also play prominent and diverse roles in folklore, religion, and popular culture.
They have been featured in art since prehistoric times, when they appeared in early cave paintings.
Many young child know of Big Bird, a very large canary of Sesame Street fame.
Feathers are also used all over the world to stuff pillows, mattresses, sleeping bags, coats, and quilting.
Goose feathers are preferred because they are soft.
Manufacturers often mix goose feathers with down feathers to provide extra softness.
Birds and the Ecosystem
Birds are obviously important members of many ecosystems.
They are integral parts of food chains and food webs.
In a woodland ecosystem for example, some birds get their food mainly from plants.
Others chiefly eat small animals, such as insects or earthworms.
Birds and bird eggs, in turn, serve as food for such animals as foxes, raccoons, and snakes.
The feeding relationships among all the animals in an ecosystem help prevent any one species from becoming too numerous.
Birds play a vital role in keeping this balance of nature.
In addition to being important parts of food webs, birds play other roles within ecosystems.
Birds eat insects.
They are a natural way to control pests in gardens, on farms, and other places.
A group of birds gliding through the air can easily eat hundreds of insects each day.
Insect eating birds include warblers, bluebirds and woodpeckers.
