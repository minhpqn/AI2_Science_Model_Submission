Two important devices depend on electromagnetic induction: electric generators and electric transformers.
Both devices play critical roles in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our daily lives.
Electric generators use electromagnetic induction to change kinetic energy to electrical energy.
They produce electricity in power plants.
Electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current.
Some transformers increase voltage and other decrease voltage.
Q:
How do you think the girl on the exercise bike in the opening photo is using electromagnetic induction?
A:
As she pedals the bike, the kinetic energy of the turning pedals is used to move a conductor through a magnetic field.
This generates electric current by electromagnetic induction.
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field.
It occurs whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor move relative to one another so the conductor crosses lines of force in the magnetic field.
The current produced by electromagnetic induction is greater when the magnet or coil moves faster, the coil has more turns, or the magnet is stronger.
If the magnet or coil is moved back and forth repeatedly, alternating current is produced.
Electric generators and electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to generate electricity or change the voltage of electric current.
