How did the "trade winds" get their name?
Not so long ago ships could only sail in the direction the wind was blowing, more-or-less.
For centuries, a trip could be made or broken by how hard the wind blew.
The trade winds were named because they were a reliable way to get across the ocean.
Ships engaged in trade needed these winds to take or leave goods.
