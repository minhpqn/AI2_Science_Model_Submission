The protactinium-234 produced in the reaction is also radioactive, so it will decay as well.
A nuclear equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons and neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow.
If you compare the subscripts and superscripts on both sides of the equation above, you’ll see that they are the same.
Q:
What happens to the electron produced in the reaction above?
A:
Along with another electron, it can combine with an alpha particle to form a helium atom.
An alpha particle, which is emitted during alpha decay, consists of two protons and two neutrons.
Q:
Try to balance the following nuclear equation for beta-minus decay by filling in the missing subscript and superscript.
\mathrm{^{131}_{53} I} → \mathrm{^?_?
Xe} + \mathrm{^0_{-1} e} + energy
A:
The subscript of Xe is 54, and the superscript is 131.
Dangers of Beta Decay
Beta particles can travel about a meter through air.
They can pass through a sheet of paper or a layer of cloth but not through a sheet of aluminum or a few centimeters of wood.
They can also penetrate the skin and damage underlying tissues.
They are even more harmful if they are ingested or inhaled.
Beta decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many or too few neutrons relative to protons.
