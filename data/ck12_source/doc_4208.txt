So what happens to a vineyard in the middle of winter?
The vines cannot die each year.
Instead, the plants go into a state of dormancy, almost as if they are taking a long nap.
Like all organisms, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their environment.
Unlike animals, plants can’t run, fly, or swim toward food or away from danger.
They are usually rooted to the soil.
Instead, a plant’s primary means of response is to change how it is growing.
Plants also don’t have a nervous system to control their responses.
Instead, their responses are generally controlled by hormones , which are chemical messenger molecules.
Plant roots always grow downward because specialized cells in root caps detect and respond to gravity.
This is an example of a tropism.
A tropism is a turning toward or away from a stimulus in the environment.
Growing toward gravity is called geotropism .
Plants also exhibit phototropism , or growing toward a light source.
This response is controlled by a plant growth hormone called auxin .
As shown in Figure below , auxin stimulates cells on the dark side of a plant to grow longer.
This causes the plant to bend toward the light.
Phototropism is controlled by the growth hormone auxin.
Daily and Seasonal Responses
Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness.
