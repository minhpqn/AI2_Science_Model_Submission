The Eye of a Hurricane
At the center of a hurricane is a small area where the air is calm and clear.
This is called the eye of the hurricane ( Figure below ).
The eye forms at the low-pressure center of the hurricane.
Air in the eye rises upward.

The eye of this hurricane is easy to see from space.
Since hot water gives a hurricane its energy, the storm will grow stronger as long as it stays over the warm ocean.
If it goes ashore or moves over cooler water, it is cut off from the hot water energy.
This sill cause the storm to lose strength and slowly fade away.
Hurricanes typically last for five to ten days.
The winds push them until they are over cooler water or land.
When a hurricane disintegrates, it is replaced with intense rains and tornadoes.
Like tornadoes, hurricanes are classified on the basis of wind speed and damage ( Table below ).
