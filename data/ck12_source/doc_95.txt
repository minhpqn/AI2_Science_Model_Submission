Traits of Reptiles
Reptiles are tetrapods (four-legged) and ectothermic , meaning their internal temperature depends on the temperature of their environment.
This is why you may see reptiles sunbathing as they use the energy from the sun to warm their bodies.
Usually the sense organs of reptiles, like ears, are well developed, though snakes do not have external ears.
All reptiles have advanced eyesight.
Reptiles also have a sense of smell.
Crocodilians, turtles, and tortoises smell like most other land vertebrates.
But, some lizards, and all snakes, smell with their tongues, which is flicked out of the mouth to pick up scent molecules from the air.
Reptiles also have several adaptations for living on land.
They have a skin covered in scales to protect them from drying out.
All reptiles have lungs to breathe air.
Reptiles are also amniotes , which means their embryos are surrounded by a thin membrane.
This membrane protects the embryo from the harsh conditions of living on land.
Reptile eggs are also surrounded by a protective shell, which may be either flexible or inflexible.
How Do Reptiles Reproduce?
Most reptiles reproduce sexually, meaning there are two parents involved.
In some families of lizards and one snake family, however, asexual reproduction is possible.
This is when only one parent is involved in creating new life.
For example, the gecko females can make tiny clones of themselves without the aid of a male.
