It provides stiffness to counterbalance the pull of muscles.
Pharyngeal slits :
Pharyngeal slits are located in the pharynx.
The pharynx is the tube that joins the mouth to the digestive and respiratory tracts.
Body plan of a typical chordate
Body Plan of a Typical Chordate.
The body plan of a chordate includes a post-anal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.
In some chordates, all four traits persist throughout life and serve important functions.
However, in many chordates, including humans, all four traits are present only during the embryonic stage.
After that, some of the traits disappear or develop into other organs.
For example, in humans, pharyngeal slits are present in embryos and later develop into the middle ear.
Classification of Chordates
Living species of chordates are classified into three major subphyla:
Vertebrata, Urochordata, and Cephalochordata.
Vertebrates are all chordates that have a backbone.
The other two subphyla are invertebrate chordates that lack a backbone.
Chordates include vertebrates and invertebrates that have a notochord.
Chordates also have a post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.
Vertebrate chordates have a backbone.
