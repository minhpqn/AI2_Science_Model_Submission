Calculate the heat absorbed when 31.6 g of ice at 0Â°C is completely melted.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem .
mass = 31.6 g ice
molar mass H 2 O( s ) = 18.02 g/mol
molar heat of fusion = 6.01 kJ/mol
\Delta H=? \text{ J}
The mass of ice is first converted to moles.
This is then multiplied by the conversion factor of \left(\frac{6.01 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}}\right) in order to find the kJ of heat absorbed.
Step 2:
Solve .
31.6 \text{ g ice} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol ice}}{18.02 \text{ g ice}} \times \frac{6.01 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol ice}}=10.5 \text{ kJ}
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The given quantity is a bit less than 2 moles of ice, and so just less than 12 kJ of heat is absorbed by the melting process.
Molar heats of fusion and solidification are defined.
Calculations of heat changes during fusion and solidification are described.
