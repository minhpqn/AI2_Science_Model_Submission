Drawing of Sherlock Holmes
Who is Sherlock Holmes?
The famous fictional British detective Sherlock Holmes was often said to make the statement “elementary, my dear Watson.” In reality, the closest he ever came to that line was an exchange with Watson in the short story “The Crooked Man.” Holmes shows shrewd insight into Watson’s activities of the day.
When asked how he knew what Watson was doing, Holmes simply replies “Elementary.” Regardless of exactly how he put it, Sherlock was simply referring to what the Free Dictionary defines as “relating to, or constituting the basic, essential, or fundamental part.”
