Infection by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites can cause pneumonia.
An injury caused by chemicals or a physical injury to the lungs can also cause pneumonia.
Symptoms of pneumonia include cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing.
Treatment depends on the cause of pneumonia.
Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics.
Pneumonia is a common illness that affects people in all age groups.
It is a leading cause of death among the elderly and people who are chronically and terminally ill.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a common and often deadly disease caused by a genus of bacterium called Mycobacterium .
Tuberculosis most commonly attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body.
TB is a chronic disease, but most people who become infected do not develop the full disease.
Symptoms include a cough, which usually contains mucus and coughing up blood.
The TB bacteria are spread in the air when people who have the disease cough, sneeze, or spit, so it is very contagious.
To help prevent the spread of the disease, public health notices, such as the one pictured below ( Figure below ), remind people how to stop the spread of the disease.
Tuberculosis is easily spread through coughing, sneezing, and spitting
A public health notice from the early 20th century reminded people that TB could be spread very easily.
Lung cancer is a disease in which the cells found in the lungs grow out of control.
The growing mass of cells can form a tumor that pushes into nearby tissues.
The tumor will affect how these tissues work.
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men, and the second most common in women.
It is responsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide every year ( Figure below ).
