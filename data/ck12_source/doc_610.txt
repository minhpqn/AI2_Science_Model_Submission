Females do not need to use special feminine hygiene products.
In fact, using them may do more harm than good because they can irritate the vagina or other reproductive structures.
You should also avoid other behaviors that can put you at risk.
Do not get into contact with another personâ€™s blood or other body fluids.
For example, never get a tattoo or piercing unless you are sure that the needles have not been used before.
This is one of the most important ways to prevent an STI.
Of course, the only way to be fully protected against STIs is to refrain from sexual activity.
If you are a boy, you should always wear a protective cup when you play contact sports.
Contact sports include football, boxing, and hockey.
Wearing a cup will help protect the testes from injury.
You should also do a monthly self-exam to check for cancer of the testes.
If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every four to six hours.
Leaving tampons in for too long can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome .
This is a serious condition.
Signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome develop suddenly, and the disease can be fatal.
The disease involves fever, shock, and problems with the function of several body organs.
Girls should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check for breast cancer.
Although breast cancer is rare in teens, it's a good idea to start doing the exam when you are young.
It will help you get to know what is normal for you.
To keep the reproductive system healthy, keep the genitals clean and avoid coming into contact with body fluids, like blood or semen.
