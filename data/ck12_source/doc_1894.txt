Principles of Relative Dating
Describe how Steno's laws are used to determine the geologic history of a region.
Where's a good place to see geology?
The Southwestern United States is a fantastic place to see geology.
The arid climate means that that the rocks are not covered by vegetation.
In many places, especially the national parks, the formations are fantastic.

Relative Age Dating
Early geologists had no way to determine the absolute age of a geological material.
If they didn't see it form, they couldn't know if a rock was one hundred years or 100 million years old.
What they could do was determine the ages of materials relative to each other.
Using sensible principles they could say whether one rock was older than another.
They could also determine when a process occurred relative to those rocks.
Laws of Stratigraphy
The study of rock strata is called stratigraphy .
The laws of stratigraphy can help scientists understand Earthâ€™s past.
