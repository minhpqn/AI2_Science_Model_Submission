They are known as metalloids.
Examples of metalloids include silicon and boron.

A chemical compound is a new substance that forms when atoms of two or more elements react with one another.
A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into other chemical substances.
A compound that results from a chemical reaction always has a unique and fixed chemical composition.
The substances in the compound can be separated from one another only by another chemical reaction.
This is covered further in Concept Biochemistry (Advanced) .
Atoms bond with each other through the interactions of their electrons, specifically their outermost or valence electrons.
The atoms of a compound are held together by chemical bonds.
Chemical bonds form when atoms share electrons.
There are different types of chemical bonds, and they vary in how strongly they hold together the atoms of a compound.
Two of the strongest types of bonds are covalent and ionic bonds.
Covalent bonds form between atoms that have little if any difference in electronegativity, and result when atoms share electrons.
Electronegativity is the power of an atom to attract electrons toward itself.
Ionic bonds , in contrast, form between atoms that are significantly different in electronegativity.
An ion is an atom that has gained or lost at least one electron.
Ionic bonds form between ions of opposite charges.
An example of a chemical compound is water.
