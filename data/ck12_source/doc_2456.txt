Relationship between kinetic energy and state of matter
Q:
How could you use a bottle of cola to demonstrate these relationships between kinetic energy and state of matter?
A:
You could shake a bottle of cola and then open it.
Shaking causes carbon dioxide to come out of the cola solution and change to a gas.
The gas fizzes out of the bottle and spreads into the surrounding air, showing that its particles have enough kinetic energy to spread apart.
Then you could tilt the open bottle and pour out a small amount of the cola on a table, where it will form a puddle.
This shows that particles of the liquid have enough kinetic energy to slide over each other but not enough to pull apart completely.
If you do nothing to the solid glass of the cola bottle, it will remain the same size and shape.
Its particles do not have enough energy to move apart or even to slide over each other.
According to the kinetic theory, particles of matter are in constant motion.
The energy of motion is called kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy of particles of matter determines the state of matter.
Particles of solids have the least kinetic energy and particles of gases have the most.
