The law of reflection states that, when a light ray strikes a reflecting surface, the angle of incidence (measured from the normal line) is equal to the angle of reflection (also measured from the normal line).
If the reflecting surface is a very smooth surface, the reflection will be regular, in which the light rays maintain their position relative to each other.
If the reflecting surface is rough, the reflection will be diffuse and objects will be distorted in the reflection.
Images in a plane mirror are reversed left and right but not reversed top and bottom.
Use the video on reflection to answer the questions that follow.
Both the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are measured from the _________.
In reflection, the angle of incidence _________  the angle of reflection.
How does regular reflection differ from diffuse reflection?
If a light ray strikes a mirrored surface at an angle of 25Â° to the surface, what is the angle of incidence?
For problem #2, what will be the angle of reflection?
A dry cement road is a diffuse reflector.  When it rains, the water fills in all the little holes and cracks in the cement road and it becomes a smooth regular reflector.  At night, when you are depending on the light from your headlights to show you the lines on the road, a wet road becomes much darker and it is more difficult to see the lines.  Explain why this occurs.
law of reflection:
The law of reflection says that the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected.
regular reflection:
If a parallel beams of light falls on a smooth surface, the reflected beams are also parallel.
diffuse reflection:
When the reflecting surface is rough, parallel incident beams of light would be reflected in non-parallel, random directions.
