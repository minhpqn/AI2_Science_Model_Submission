A self-adjusting mechanism of a stimulus and a response; controlled by a product or effect of the system; also known as a feedback loop.
kinase :
A type of enzyme catalyzes phosphorylation; transfers phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific substrates.
The cell cycle is controlled through feedback mechanisms involving cyclin and CDK proteins.
Three important checkpoints are the G 1 , G 2 , and M phase checkpoints.
