The arc around the galaxies at the center of this image is caused by gravitational lensing.
The addition of gravitational pull from dark matter is required to explain this phenomenon.
What is Dark Matter?
What is dark matter?
Actually, we don’t really know.
Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth.
The Universe could contain lots of objects that don’t have enough mass to glow on their own.
There might just be a lot of black holes.
Another possibility is that the Universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know.
If it doesn’t interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly.
Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination.
Ordinary matter is part of it.
That is mixed with some kind of matter that we haven’t discovered yet.
Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the Universe.
We know that the Universe is expanding.
Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity.
Would the Universe just expand forever?
If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday start to contract?
This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch.
This is the opposite of the Big Bang.
