Water pollution comes from many sources.
One of the biggest sources is runoff.
Runoff picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses.
It carries the chemicals to bodies of water.
The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of algae, creating algal blooms (see Figure below ).
The algae use up oxygen in the water so that other aquatic organisms cannot survive.
This has occurred over large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones , where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life.
A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico.
Measures that can help prevent these problems include cutting down on fertilizer use.
Preserving wetlands also helps because wetlands filter runoff water.
Nutrients in fertilizer cause an algal bloom
Algal Bloom.
Nutrients from fertilizer in runoff caused this algal bloom.
Soil and water are renewable resources but may be ruined by careless human actions.
Soil can be depleted of nutrients.
It can also be eroded by wind or water.
Over-use and pollution of freshwater threaten the limited supply that people depend on.
