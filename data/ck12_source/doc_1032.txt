Answering some questions requires experiments .
An experiment is a test that may be performed in the field or in a laboratory.
An experiment must always be done under controlled conditions.
The goal of an experiment is to test a hypothesis.
The data from the experiment will verify or falsify the hypothesis.
In an experiment, it is important to change only one factor.
All other factors must be kept the same.
independent variable :
The factor that will be changed.
dependent variable :
The factors that depend on the independent variable.
An experiment must have a control group .
In the control group, nothing is changed.
It is not subjected to the independent variable.
For example, say you want to test if Vitamin C prevents colds.
You gather a large number of people to be your sample group.
Then you divide your sample group up.
Some receive Vitamin C and some do not.
Those who do not receive the Vitamin C are the control group.
