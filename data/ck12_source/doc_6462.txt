Step 3:
Use a line to connect the atoms that are undergoing a change in oxidation number.
On the line, write the oxidation-number change.
Walkthrough of connecting atoms that are oxidized or reduced in a redox reaction
The carbon atom’s oxidation number increases by 2, while the iron atom’s oxidation number decreases by 3.
As written, the number of electrons lost does not equal the number of electrons gained.
In a balanced redox equation, these must be equal.
So, the increase in oxidation number of one atom must be made equal to the decrease in oxidation number of the other.
Step 4:
Use coefficients to make the total increase in oxidation number equal to the total decrease in oxidation number .
In this case, the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6.
So the oxidation-number increase should be multiplied by 3, while the oxidation-number decrease should be multiplied by 2.
The coefficient is also applied to the formulas in the equation.
So a 3 is placed in front of the CO and in front of the CO 2 .
A 2 is placed in front of the Fe on the right side of the equation.
The Fe 2 O 3 does not require a coefficient because the subscript of 2 after the Fe indicates that there are already two iron atoms.

Step 5:
Check the balancing for both atoms and charge.
Occasionally, a coefficient may need to be placed in front of a molecular formula that was not involved in the redox process.
