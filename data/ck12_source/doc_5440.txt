Discuss three specific transcription factors.
When a homeodomain binds to DNA, the actual binding portion of the homeodomain is:
A leucine zipper.
A helix-turn-helix motif.
In the zinc fingers motif, the spacing of the helical segments is performed by:
An alpha helix.
Gene Regulation and Cancer - Advanced
Discuss gene regulation in terms of the development of cancer.
What controls a growing tumor?
There are two main types of genes involved in cancer formation.
Mutations in these genes lead to the development of cancer.
One type of gene, a pro to-oncogene, is normally a transcription factor.
When transcription does not occur properly, detrimental effects can result.
Regulation of Gene Expression in Cancer
Carcinogenesis is the process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells.
The process is also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis and it depends on both the activation of oncogenes and deactivation of tumor suppressor genes .
Proto-oncogenes, the non-cancerous normal version of an oncogene, can be a transcription factor like c-fos, c-jun and c-myc, or a gene whose product is involved in signal transduction, leading to altered gene expression.
When mutations cause the regulation of this process to be disturbed, cell proliferation can be enhanced leading to tumorigenesis.
At least two separate mutations are necessary to develop cancer.
For example, a mutation in a proto-oncogene would not necessarily lead to cancer, as normally functioning tumor suppressor genes would counteract the effects of the oncogene.
