You can make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a mirror or lens than the focal length.
Virtual images are typically right-side-up.
You can make virtual images by moving the lens closer to the object than the focal length.
In ray tracing problems, you will do a careful ray tracing with a ruler (including the extrapolation of rays for virtual images).
It is best if you can use different colors for the three different ray tracings.
When sketching diverging rays, you should use dotted lines for the extrapolated lines in front of a lens in order to produce the virtual image.
When comparing measured distances and heights to calculated distances and heights, values within 10 % are considered “good.” Use the Table ( below ) as your guide.
( convex )
Ray #1:
Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, refracts and travels through to the focus.
Ray #2:
Leaves tip, travels through focus on same side, travels through lens, and exits lens parallel to optic axis on opposite side.
Ray #3:
Leaves tip, passes straight through center of lens and exits without bending.
( concave )
Ray #1:
Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, refracts OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the SAME side as the candle.
Ray #2:
Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel from the lens.
Ray #3:
