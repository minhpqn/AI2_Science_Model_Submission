Notice that in order to write and balance the equation correctly, it is important to remember the seven elements that exist in nature as diatomic molecules (H 2 , N 2 , O 2 , F 2 , Cl 2 , Br 2 , and I 2 ).
One sort of combination reaction that occurs frequently is the reaction of an element with oxygen to form an oxide.
Metals and nonmetals both react readily with oxygen under most conditions.
Magnesium reacts rapidly and dramatically when ignited, combining with oxygen from the air to produce a fine powder of magnesium oxide.
2\text{Mg}(s)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{MgO}(s)
This reaction can be seen in the following video:

Sulfur reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide.
\text{S}(s)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{SO}_2 (g)
When nonmetals react with one another, the product is a molecular compound.
Often, the nonmetal reactants can combine in different ratios and produce different products.
Sulfur can also combine with oxygen to produce sulfur trioxide.
2\text{S}(s)+3\text{O}_2 (g) \rightarrow 2\text{SO}_3 (g)
Transition metals are capable of adopting multiple positive charges within their ionic compounds.
Therefore, most transition metals are capable of forming different products in a combination reaction.
Iron reacts with oxygen to form both iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide.
& 2\text{Fe}(s)+\text{O}_2 (g) \rightarrow 2\text{FeO}(s)\\& 4 \text{Fe}(s)+3\text{O}_2 (g) \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)

Combination Reactions
Potassium is a very reactive alkali metal that must be stored under oil in order to prevent it from reacting with air.
