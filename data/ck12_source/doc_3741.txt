Examples include silent point mutations.
They are neutral because they do not change the amino acids in the proteins they encode.
Many other mutations have no effect on the organism because they are repaired before protein synthesis occurs.
Cells have multiple repair mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA.
One way DNA can be repaired is illustrated in Figure below .
If a cell’s DNA is permanently damaged and cannot be repaired, the cell is likely to be prevented from dividing.
DNA repair pathway
DNA Repair Pathway.
This flow chart shows one way that damaged DNA is repaired in E. coli bacteria.
Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur.
They are called beneficial mutations .
They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their environment.
Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur.
They increase an organism’s changes of surviving or reproducing, so they are likely to become more common over time.
There are several well-known examples of beneficial mutations.
Here are just two:
Mutations in many bacteria that allow them to survive in the presence of antibiotic drugs.
The mutations lead to antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.
A unique mutation is found in people in a small town in Italy.
The mutation protects them from developing atherosclerosis, which is the dangerous buildup of fatty materials in blood vessels.
