Besides providing a home, the fungus also provides nutrients.
In turn, the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the fungus by performing photosynthesis, obtaining energy directly from the sun.
A lichen is also an example of a mutualistic relationship.
Because lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in new ecosystems.

Fungi and Insects
Many insects have a symbiotic relationship with certain types of fungi:
Ants and termites grow fungi in underground “fungus gardens” that they create.
When the ants or termites have eaten a big meal of wood or leaves, they also eat some fungi from their gardens.
The fungi help them digest the wood or leaves.
The fungi secrete certain enzymes that the ants or termites cannot produce on their own.
Ambrosia beetles live in the bark of trees.
Like ants and termites, they grow fungi inside the bark of trees and use it to help digest their food.
Fungi as Parasites
Although lots of symbiotic relationships help both organisms, sometimes one of the organisms is harmed.
When that happens, the organism that benefits, and is not harmed, is called a parasite .
This type of relationship is known as parasitism.
Examples of parasitic fungi include the following:
Beginning in 1950, Dutch Elm trees in the United States began to die.
