Charles Richter developed the Richter magnitude scale in 1935.
The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake's largest jolt of energy.
This is determined by using the height of the waves recorded on a seismograph.
The Richter scale is logarithmic.
The magnitudes jump from one level to the next.
The height of the largest wave increases 10 times with each level.
So the height of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake.
A magnitude 5 is 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake.
With each level, thirty times more energy is released.
A difference of two levels on the Richter scale equals 900 times more released energy.
The Richter scale has limitations.
A single sharp jolt measures higher on the Richter scale than a very long intense earthquake.
Yet, this is misleading because the longer quake releases more energy.
Earthquakes that release more energy are likely to do more damage.
As a result, another scale was needed.
The Moment Magnitude Scale
The moment magnitude scale is the favored method of measuring earthquake magnitudes.
It measures the total energy released by an earthquake.
Moment magnitude is calculated by two things.
One is the length of the fault break.
