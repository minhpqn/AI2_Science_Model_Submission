What attractive forces develop between polar molecules?
What creates London dispersion forces?
Are London dispersion forces permanent or temporary?
Are the dispersion forces for Cl 2 stronger or weaker than the ones for Br 2 ?
dipole-dipole forces:
The attractive forces that occur between polar molecule s
London dispersion forces:
The intermolecular forces that occur between atoms and between nonpolar molecules as a result of the motion of electrons.
Van der Waals forces:
The weakest intermolecular force and consist of dipole-dipole forces and dispersion forces .
Define hydrogen bond.
Describe molecular structures that will participate in hydrogen bond formation.
Structure of nitrogen gas
Structure of ammonia
What’s the difference between these two molecules?
A rough rule of thumb is that higher molecular-weight materials have higher boiling points than their lower molecular weight counterparts.
More energy is needed to move the larger molecule from the liquid state to the vapor state.  However, ammonia has a boiling point of -33.34°C and a molecular weight of 17 while nitrogen (molecular weight 28) has a boiling point of -195.8°C.  The lighter ammonia molecule must have other factors that influence its physical properties.
The attractive force between water molecules is a dipole interaction.
The hydrogen atoms are bound to the highly electronegative oxygen atom (which also possesses two lone pair sets of electrons, making for a very polar bond.  The partially positive hydrogen atom of one molecule is then attracted to the oxygen atom of a nearby water molecule (see Figure below ).
