The rock may also be compressed by other geological processes.
If the rock is buried deeply, it may experience high temperatures.
Regional metamorphic rocks display foliation, which can result in blueschist
(A) Regional metamorphic rocks often display layering called foliation. (B) Regional metamorphism with high pressures and low temperatures can result in blueschist.
Metamorphism does not cause a rock to melt completely.
It only causes the minerals to change by heat or pressure.
If the rock melts completely, it will cool to become an igneous rock.
Hornfels is a rock with alternating bands of dark and light crystals.
Hornfels is a good example of how minerals rearrange themselves during metamorphism ( Figure above ).
The minerals in hornfels separate by density.
The result is that the rock becomes banded.
Gneiss forms by regional metamorphism from extremely high temperature and pressure.
Any type of rock—igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic—can become a metamorphic rock.
Contact metamorphism occurs when a rock is altered by heat from a nearby magma.
Regional metamorphism occurs over a large area when a rock is buried or compressed.
