Confocal Microscopy
Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique used to increase optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by using point illumination and a spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane.
These important features also allow confocal microscopes to collect double and triple labels(most commonly used for detecting fluorescent labels), since precise colocalizations can be performed.
Examples of specific uses of the confocal microscope are:
to resolve the structure of various complex three-dimensional objects, such as networks of cytoskeletal fibers in the cytoplasm of cells
the arrangements of chromosomes and genes in a cell's nucleus during different points in the cell division cycle
observing pollen grains whose complex cell wall can only be seen clearly using confocal microscopy
Cutting-edge confocal microscopes, at the University of California, San Francisco are helping scientists create three-dimensional images of cells, and may help lead to new medical breakthroughs, including a treatment for Type 1 diabetes.

confocal microscopy :
An optical imaging technique used to increase optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by using point illumination and a spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane.
electron microscope :
A microscope that uses electrons instead of light; allows a researcher to see things at very high magnification, far higher than an optical microscope can magnify.
magnification :
Enlarging an image of an object so that it appears much bigger than its actual size; also refers to the number of times an object is magnified.
