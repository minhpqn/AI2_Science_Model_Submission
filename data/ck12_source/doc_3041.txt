What is Pascal’s law?
Apply Pascal’s law to the ketchup packet shown in the Figure below .
Explain what will happen if you tear a small hole in one corner of a packet and then squeeze the packet.
Ketchup packet practice problem for Pascal's law
State Bernoulli’s law.
Relate Bernoulli’s law to flight.
Look at the large bar (labeled “TELMEX”) across the back of this racecar.
The bar is called a spoiler.
It causes air pressure to push the car toward the ground.
This increases friction between the wheels and the pavement, helping the car to hug the track.
How does a spoiler work?
Bernoulli’s law has the answer.
What Is Bernoulli’s Law?
Bernoulli’s law states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as air is less when the fluid is moving faster.
Pressure is the amount of force applied per given area.
The law is named for Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician who discovered it during the 1700s.
Bernoulli used mathematics to arrive at his law.
