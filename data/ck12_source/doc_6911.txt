One can determine the number of excess electrons (or protons if positive charge) by dividing the objects charge by the fundamental charge.
Most objects are electrically neutral (equal numbers of electrons and protons) and that's why gravity dominates on a macro scale.
Question If an object has +0.003 C of charge, how many excess protons does the object have?
Answer q = Ne \text{ }  0.003 \text{C} = N \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} N =  1.875 \times 10^{16}  ; protons
