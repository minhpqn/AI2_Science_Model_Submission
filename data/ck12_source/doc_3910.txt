The multicolored shrimp in the front and the green goby fish behind it have a mutualistic relationship.
Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected.
One species typically uses the other for a purpose other than food.
For example, mites attach themselves to larger flying insects to get a “free ride.” Hermit crabs use the shells of dead snails for homes.
Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the parasite ) benefits while the other species (the host ) is harmed.
Many species of animals are parasites, at least during some stage of their life.
Most species are also hosts to one or more parasites.
Some parasites live on the surface of their host.
Others live inside their host.
They may enter the host through a break in the skin or in food or water.
For example, roundworms are parasites of mammals, including humans, cats, and dogs (see Figure below ).
The worms produce huge numbers of eggs, which are passed in the host’s feces to the environment.
Other individuals may be infected by swallowing the eggs in contaminated food or water.
Roundworms are a parasite in a dog's intestine
Roundworms like this one might eventually fill a dog’s intestine unless it gets medical treatment.
Some parasites kill their host, but most do not.
It’s easy to see why.
If a parasite kills its host, the parasite is also likely to die.
Instead, parasites usually cause relatively minor damage to their host.
Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits.
