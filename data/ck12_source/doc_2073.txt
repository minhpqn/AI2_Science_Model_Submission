When your leg is poised to kick the ball but is not yet moving, your leg has potential energy.
A ball at the top of a hill has the potential energy of location.
Kinetic energy is the energy of anything in motion.
Your muscles move your leg, your foot kicks the ball, and the ball gains kinetic energy ( Figure below ).
The kinetic energy was converted from potential energy that was in your leg before the kick.
The action of kicking the ball is energy changing forms.
The same is true for anything that involves change.
