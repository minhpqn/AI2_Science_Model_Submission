A Snowbird is usually a person who is retired.
Like a migrating bird, they go where the weather is good.
A snowbird may spend summers "at home" in Michigan or New York.
But they travel to Arizona or Florida to spend their winters in the Sun and warmth.
What would a reverse snowbird be?
A person who spent summers in the 100+ degree heat and winters in the sub-0 cold.
Brrrr....
Latitude and Climate
Latitude is the distance north or south of the Equator.
It’s measured in degrees, from 0° to 90°.
Several climate factors vary with latitude.
Latitude and Temperature
Temperature changes with latitude ( Figure below ).
At the Equator, the Sun’s rays are most direct.
This is where temperatures are highest.
At higher latitudes, the Sun’s rays are less direct.
The farther an area is from the Equator, the lower its temperature.
At the poles, the Sun’s rays are least direct.
Much of the area is covered with ice and snow, which reflect a lot of sunlight.
Temperatures are lowest here.
