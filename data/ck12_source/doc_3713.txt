What molecule is it?
You probably answered "DNA." Today, it is commonly known that DNA is the genetic material.
For a long time, scientists knew such molecules existed.
They were aware that genetic information was contained within organic molecules.
However, they didnâ€™t know which type of molecules play this role.
In fact, for many decades, scientists thought that proteins were the molecules that carry genetic information.
In this section, you will learn how scientists discovered that DNA carries the code of life.
DNA, the Genetic Material
DNA , deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic material in your cells.
It was passed on to you from your parents and determines your characteristics.
The discovery that DNA is the genetic material was another important milestone in molecular biology.
Griffith Searches for the Genetic Material
Many scientists contributed to the identification of DNA as the genetic material.
In the 1920s, Frederick Griffith made an important discovery.
He was studying two different strains of a bacterium, called R (rough) strain and S (smooth) strain.
He injected the two strains into mice.
The S strain killed (virulent) the mice, but the R strain did not (non-virulent) (see Figure below ).
Griffith also injected mice with S-strain bacteria that had been killed by heat.
As expected, the killed bacteria did not harm the mice.
However, when the dead S-strain bacteria were mixed with live R-strain bacteria and injected, the mice died.
