Naming Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds are named for their positive and negative ions.
The name of the positive ion always comes first, followed by the name of the negative ion.
For example, positive sodium ions and negative chloride ions form the compound named sodium chloride.
Similarly, positive calcium ions and negative chloride ions form the compound named calcium chloride.
Q:
What is the name of the ionic compound that is composed of positive barium ions and negative iodide ions?
A:
The compound is named barium iodide.
Properties of Ionic Compounds
The crystal structure of ionic compounds is strong and rigid.
It takes a lot of energy to break all those ionic bonds.
As a result, ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points.
You can see the melting and boiling points of several different ionic compounds in the Table below .
To appreciate how high they are, consider that the melting and boiling points of water, which is not an ionic compound, are 0째C and 100째C, respectively.
