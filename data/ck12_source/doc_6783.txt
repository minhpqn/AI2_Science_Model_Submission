The Big Idea
The third conservation law is conservation of angular momentum.
This vector quantity is the product of rotational velocity and rotational inertia.
In any closed system (including the universe) the quantity of angular momentum is fixed.
Angular momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but cannot be lost or gained.
If a system has its angular momentum changed from the outside it is caused by a torque.
Torque is a force applied at a distance from the center of rotation.
Kinematics of Rotation
Apply the kinematic equations for rotation.
Students will learn how to apply the kinematic equations for rotation.
v = r \omega
linear speed v is equal to the angular speed  \omega  multiplied by the radius of the rotating object.
a = r \alpha
linear acceleration a is equal to the angular acceleration  \alpha multiplied by the radius of the rotating object.
\theta (t) = \theta_0 + \omega_0 t + 1/2 \alpha t^2
Rotational equivalent of  x (t) = x_i + v_i t +1/2at^2
\omega (t) = \omega_0 + \alpha t
Rotational equivalent of  v_f = v_i + at
\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2 \alpha (\triangle \theta)
Rotational equivalent of  v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a \Delta x
