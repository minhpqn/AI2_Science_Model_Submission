Each skeletal muscle consists of hundreds or even thousands of skeletal muscle fibers .
The fibers are bundled together and wrapped in connective tissue, as shown Figure below .
The connective tissue supports and protects the delicate muscle cells and allows them to withstand the forces of contraction.
It also provides pathways for nerves and blood vessels to reach the muscles.
Skeletal muscles work hard to move body parts.
They need a rich blood supply to provide them with nutrients and oxygen and to carry away their wastes.

Skeletal Muscle Structure.
A skeletal muscle contains bundles of muscle fibers inside a “coat” of connective tissue.

Skeletal Muscles and Bones
Skeletal muscles are attached to the skeleton by tough connective tissues called tendons (see Figure above ).
Many skeletal muscles are attached to the ends of bones that meet at a joint .
The muscles span the joint and connect the bones.
When the muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to move.
