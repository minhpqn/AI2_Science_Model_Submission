Using the fact that the satellite will have the same period of revolution as Earth, calculate the radius of its orbit.
What is the ratio of the radius of this orbit to the radius of the Earth?
Draw a sketch, to scale, of the Earth and the orbit of this digital TV satellite.
If the mass of the satellite were to double, would the radius of the satellite’s orbit be larger, smaller, or the same?
Why?
A top secret spy satellite is designed to orbit the Earth twice each day ( i.e., twice as fast as the Earth’s rotation).
What is the height of this orbit above the Earth’s surface?
Two stars with masses 3.00\times10^{31} \;\mathrm{kg} and 7.00\times10^{30} \;\mathrm{kg} are orbiting each other under the influence of each other’s gravity.
We want to send a satellite in between them to study their behavior.
However, the satellite needs to be at a point where the gravitational forces from the two stars are equal.
The distance between the two stars is 2.0\times10^{10} \;\mathrm{m} .
Find the distance from the more massive star to where the satellite should be placed. ( Hint:
Distance from the satellite to one of the stars is the variable.)
Calculate the mass of the Earth using only: (i) Newton’s Universal Law of Gravity; (ii) the Moon-Earth distance (Appendix B ); and (iii) the fact that it takes the Moon 27 days to orbit the Earth.
A space station was established far from the gravitational field of Earth.
Extended stays in zero gravity are not healthy for human beings.
Thus, for the comfort of the astronauts, the station is rotated so that the astronauts feel there is an internal gravity.
The rotation speed is such that the apparent acceleration of gravity is 9.8 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 .
The direction of rotation is counter-clockwise.
If the radius of the station is 80 \;\mathrm{m} , what is its rotational speed, v ?
