\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2} \ \text{mv}^2

\text{m} = \text{mass}
\text{v} = \text{velocity}
Energy is defined as the capacity to do work or to produce heat.
As discussed previously, kinetic energy is one type of energy and is associated with motion.
Another frequently encountered energy is potential energy , a type of energy that is stored in matter and released during a chemical reaction.
The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy and is named after English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-1889).
If we go back to the equation for kinetic energy written above, we can put units in (kg for mass and m 2 /s 2 for velocity squared).
Then, in terms of SI base units a joule is equal to a kilogram times meter squared divided by a second squared (kg • m 2 /s 2 ).
Another common unit of energy that is often used is the calorie (cal), which is equivalent to 4.184 J.
