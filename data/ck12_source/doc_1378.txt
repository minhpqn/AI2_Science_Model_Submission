The cinders are piled on top of one another.
The cinders can be mafic, intermediate, or felsic in composition.
These volcanoes usually do not produce streams of lava.
Cinder cones often form near larger volcanoes.
Most composite and shield volcanoes have nearby cinder cones.
Cinder cones usually build up very rapidly.
They only erupt for a short time.
Many only produce one eruption.
For this reason, cinder cones do not reach the sizes of stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes ( Figure below ).

Magma composition determines both eruption type and volcano type.
Composite volcanoes are common at convergent boundaries.
Shield volcanoes are produced at divergent plate boundaries and intraplate.
Cinder cones are made of small fragments of a variety of compositions usually from a single eruption.
They are found with composite and shield volcanoes.
