Discuss the role of ethics in science.
Units of Measurement - Advanced
Identify the units of measurement that scientists use.
List common SI base units.
Name common SI prefixes.
How do you measure something really really small?
If we are talking about a cell, then not with a ruler.
Units must exist that can describe sizes many times smaller than the smallest marking on a ruler.
Units of Measurement
The measurements that scientists use are based on the International System of Units (SI), which is a form of the metric system.
The term SI is shortened from the French term Le Système international d'unités .
It is the world's most widely used system of units, both in science and business.
It is useful to scientists because it is based on multiples of 10.
The SI was developed in 1960 from an older metric system and is used in almost every country.
The SI is not static, as the technology of measurement progresses, units are created and definitions are changed through international agreement among many nations.
The international system of units is made up of a seven base units, shown in the SI Base Units Table below .
From these seven base units several other units are derived.
thermal energy (temperature)
amount of substance
A prefix may be added to SI units to make a multiple of the original unit.
