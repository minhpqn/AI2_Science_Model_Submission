They form different, stable elements when they decay.
The decay of an unstable isotope to a stable element occurs at a constant rate.
This rate is different for each parent-daughter isotope pair.
The decay rate is measured in a unit called the half-life.
The half-life is the time it takes for half of a given amount of an isotope to decay.
For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years.
Imagine that you start out with 100 grams of carbon-14.
In 5,730 years, half of it decays.
This leaves 50 grams of carbon-14.
Over the next 5,730 years, half of the remaining amount will decay.
Now there are 25 grams of carbon-14.
How many grams will there be in another 5,730 years?
The figure below graphs the rate of decay of a substance ( Figure below ).

The rate of decay of a radioactive substance is constant over time.
A half-life is the time it takes for half of the parent isotopes of an element to change to the daughter product.
With alpha decay, the nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons.
Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years.
