Change the –e at the end of the name of the alkane to –al .
Nomenclature of aldehydes
For ketones, R and R’ must be carbon chains, of either the same or different lengths.
The steps for naming ketones, followed by two examples, are shown below.
Name the parent compound by finding the longest continuous chain that contains the carbonyl group.
Change the –e at the end of the name of the alkane to –one .
Number the carbon atoms in the chain in a way that the carbonyl group has the lowest possible number.
Add the numerical prefix into the name before the name of the ketone.
Use a hyphen between the number and the name of the ketone.

Properties of Aldehydes and Ketones
Aldehydes and ketones can work weak hydrogen bonds with water through the carbonyl oxygen atom.
The lower members of both series (3 carbons or fewer) are soluble in water in all proportions.
As the length of the carbon chain increases, water solubility decreases.
Similar to ethers, neither aldehydes nor ketones can hydrogen bond with themselves.
As a result, their boiling points are generally lower than those of alcohols.
Unlike alkanes however, aldehydes and ketones are polar molecules due to the more electronegative oxygen atom.
The dipole-dipole interactions are stronger than the dispersion forces present in alkanes.
The boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are intermediate between those of alkanes and alcohols.
For example, the boiling point of ethane is -89°C, ethanal is 20°C, and ethanol is 78°C.
