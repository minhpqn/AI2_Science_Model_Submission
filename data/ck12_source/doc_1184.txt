Sulfate minerals contain sulfur atoms bonded to oxygen atoms.
Like halides, they can form in places where salt water evaporates.
Many minerals belong in the sulfate group, but there are only a few common sulfate minerals.
Gypsum is a common sulfate mineral that contains calcium, sulfate, and water.
Gypsum is found in various forms.
For example, it can be pink and look like it has flower petals.
However, it can also grow into very large white crystals.
Gypsum crystals that are 11-meters-long have been found.
That is about as long as a school bus!
Gypsum forms at the Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park ( Figure below ).

Sulfides contain metal elements combined with sulfur.
Sulfides are different from sulfates.
They do not contain oxygen.
Pyrite is a common sulfide mineral ( Figure below ).
It contains iron combined with sulfur.
Pyrite is also known as “fool’s gold.” Gold miners have mistaken pyrite for gold because pyrite has a greenish gold color.
