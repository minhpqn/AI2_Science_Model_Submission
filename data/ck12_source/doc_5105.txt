Bacteria lack many of the structures that eukaryotic cells contain.
For example, they don't have a nucleus.
They also lack membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts.
The DNA of a bacterial cell is also different from a eukaryotic cell.
Bacterial DNA is contained in one circular chromosome, located in the cytoplasm.
Eukaryotes have several linear chromosomes.
Bacteria also have two additional unique features: a cell wall and flagella.
The Cell Wall
Bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan .
This complex molecule consists of sugars and amino acids.
The cell wall is important for protecting bacteria.
The cell wall is so important that some antibiotics, such as penicillin, kill bacteria by preventing the cell wall from forming.
Some bacteria depend on a host organism for energy and nutrients.
These bacteria are known as parasites .
If the host starts attacking the parasitic bacteria, the bacteria release a layer of slime that surrounds the cell wall.
This slime offers an extra layer of protection.
Some bacteria also have tail-like structures called flagella ( Figure below ).
Flagella help bacteria move.
As the flagella rotate, they spin the bacteria and propel them forward.
Though some eukaryotic cells do have a flagella, a flagella in eukaryotes is rare.
