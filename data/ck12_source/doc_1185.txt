Pyrite has a similar color to gold.
The appearance of the striations make pyrite different from gold.
Silicates, made of building blocks of silica tetrahedrons, are the most abundant minerals on Earth.
Silica tetrahedrons combine together in six different ways to create rings, single and double chains, large flat sheets, or 3-dimensional structures.
Other mineral groups have other chemical components like carbonates, oxides, or phosphates.
Minerals that are native elements are made of only one element.
