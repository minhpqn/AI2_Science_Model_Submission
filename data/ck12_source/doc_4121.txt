What did the first life forms look like?
The first forms of life on Earth were probably smaller and simpler than even these bacteria.
The first forms of life had to be simple single-celled organisms.
But how did life begin on Earth?
Origin of Life
There is good evidence that life has probably existed on Earth for most of Earth’s history.
Fossils of blue-green algae found in Australia are the oldest fossils of life forms on Earth.
They are at least 3.5 billion years old ( Figure below ).

Some of the oldest fossils on Earth were found along the coast of Australia, similar to the area shown here.
Life from Random Reactions
How did life begin?
In order to answer this question, scientists need to know what kinds of materials were available at that time.
We know that the ingredients for life were present at the beginning of Earth’s history.
Scientists believe early Earth did not contain oxygen gas, but did contain other gases, including:
Where did these ingredients come from?
Some chemicals were in water and volcanic gases ( Figure below ).
Other chemicals would have come from meteorites in space.
Energy to drive chemical reactions was provided by volcanic eruptions and lightning.
Today, we have evidence that life on Earth came from random reactions between chemical compounds, which formed molecules , or groups of atoms bonded together.
