Can you guess one of the main organs of the cardiovascular system?
Yes, your heart.
Functions of the Cardiovascular System
Your cardiovascular system has many jobs.
At times the cardiovascular system can work like a pump, a heating system, or even a postal carrier.
To do these tasks, your cardiovascular system works with other organ systems, such as the respiratory, endocrine, and nervous systems.
The cardiovascular system ( Figure below ) is made up of the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood.
It moves nutrients, gases (like oxygen), and wastes to and from your cells.
Every cell in your body depends on your cardiovascular system.
If your cells don't receive nutrients, they cannot survive.
The main function of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen to each of your cells.
Blood receives oxygen in your lungs (the main organs of the respiratory system) and then is pumped, by your heart, throughout your body.
The oxygen then diffuses into your cells, and carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, moves from your cells into your blood to be delivered back to your lungs and exhaled.
Each cell in your body needs oxygen, as oxygen is used in cellular respiration to produce energy in the form of ATP.
Without oxygen, lactic acid fermentation would occur in your cells, which can only be maintained for a brief period of time.
Arteries carry blood full of oxygen ("oxygen-rich") away from the heart and veins return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.
The cardiovascular system also plays a role in maintaining body temperature.
It helps to keep you warm by moving warm blood around your body.
Your blood vessels also control your body temperature to keep you from getting too hot or too cold.
When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter.
