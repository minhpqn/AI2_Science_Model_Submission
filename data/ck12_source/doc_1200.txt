First we need to learn what the rocks types and processes are.
What is a Rock?
A rock is a naturally formed, non-living Earth material.
Rocks are made of minerals.
The minerals may be so tiny that you can only see them with a microscope.
The minerals may be really large.
A rock may be made of only one type of mineral.
More often rocks are made of a mixture of different minerals.
A few types of rocks are made from materials that are not minerals.
For example, coal is organic so it is not a mineral, nor is it made of minerals.
Yet coal is a rock.

(A) Granite has large crystals because it cools slowly. (B) Basalt has very small crystals because it cools quickly. (C) Coal is made up of organic material. (D) Jade is made of the mineral jadeite.
Rocks are named for the combinations of minerals they are made of and the ways those minerals came together.
Remember that different minerals form under different environmental conditions.
So the minerals in a rock contain clues about the conditions in which the rock formed ( Figure above ).
Geologists group rocks based on how they form.
There are three major rock types.
Each will be described in more detail in the coming concepts.
Igneous rocks form when magma cools below Earthâ€™s surface or lava cools at the surface.
