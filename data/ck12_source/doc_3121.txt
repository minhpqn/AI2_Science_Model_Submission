Check your knowledge of forms of energy with the game at this URL:
Make a table of forms of energy.
In your table, list and define five of the forms of energy described in this article.
Include an example of each form.
Identify three different forms of energy represented by the Figure below .
Define energy conversion.
Give examples of energy changing from one form to another.
Describe energy changes between kinetic and potential energy.
Sari and Daniel are spending a stormy Saturday afternoon with cartons of hot popcorn and a spellbinding movie.
They are obviously too focused on the movie to wonder where all the energy comes from to power their weekend entertainment.
They’ll give it some thought halfway through the movie when the storm causes the power to go out!
Watching movies, eating hot popcorn, and many other activities depend on electrical energy.
Most electrical energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels, which contain stored chemical energy.
When fossil fuels are burned, the chemical energy changes to thermal energy and the thermal energy is then used to generate electrical energy.
These are all examples of energy conversion.
Energy conversion is the process in which one kind of energy changes into another kind.
When energy changes in this way, the energy isn’t used up or lost.
The same amount of energy exists after the conversion as before.
Energy conversion obeys the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
