Controlling Hazardous Waste
The greatest source of hazardous waste is industry.
Agriculture is another major source.
Even households produce a lot of hazardous waste.
Hazardous Waste from Industry and Agriculture
Thanks to the lessons of Love Canal, the U.S. now has laws requiring the safe disposal of hazardous waste.
Companies must ensure that hazardous waste is not allowed to enter the environment in dangerous amounts.
They must also protect their workers from hazardous materials.
For example, they must provide employees with the proper safety gear and training ( Figure below ).

Household Hazardous Waste
Cleaning products, lawn chemicals, paints, batteries, motor oil—these are just some of the many hazardous materials that may be found in households.
You might think that a household doesn’t produce enough hazardous waste to worry about.
But all the waste from all the households adds up.
A city of just 50,000 people might produce more than 40 tons of hazardous waste each year!
Clearly, how households deal with hazardous waste matters.
What can your family do?
Reduce, reuse, recycle, or properly dispose of the wastes.
