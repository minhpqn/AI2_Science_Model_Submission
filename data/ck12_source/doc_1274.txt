What creates an island arc?
How is a continental arc different from an island arc?
Continent-Continent Convergent Plate Boundaries
Describe continent-continent convergent plate boundaries.
Explain how mountains are formed.
What do you see at a continent-continent convergent plate boundary?
Big mountains!
The best place to see two continental plates converging is in the Himalaya Mountains.
These mountains are the highest above sea level on Earth.
They are very popular with mountain climbers.
Another type of convergent plate boundary is when two continental plates collide.
Continental lithosphere is low in density and very thick.
Continental lithosphere cannot subduct.
So when two continental plates collide, they just smash together.
This is just like what happens if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your hands together.
The material has nowhere to go but up ( Figure below )!
Earthquakes and metamorphic rocks result from the tremendous forces of the collision.
But the crust is too thick for magma to get through.
As a result, there are no volcanoes at continent-continent collision zones.
