Spindle fibers line up the sister chromatids of each chromosome along the equator of the cell.
Anaphase II:
Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.
Telophase II and Cytokinesis:
The spindle breaks down, and new nuclear membranes form.
The cytoplasm of each cell divides, and four haploid cells result.
Each cell has a unique combination of chromosomes.

You can watch an animation of meiosis at this link:
Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes.
Meiosis involves two cell divisions and produces four haploid cells.
Sexual reproduction has the potential to produce tremendous genetic variation in offspring.
This is due in part to crossing-over during meiosis.
See Meiosis at  for a detailed summary.
