An equation that shows only the formulas of the reactants and products with nothing to indicate the relative amounts.
Balance chemical equations when given the skeleton information.
Portrait of John Dalton
When you cook a meal, quite often there are leftovers because you prepared more than people would eat at one sitting.
Sometimes when you repair a piece of equipment, you end up with what are called “pocket parts”, small pieces you put in your pocket because you’re not sure where they belong.
Chemistry tries to avoid leftovers and pocket parts.
In normal chemical processes, we cannot create or destroy matter (law of conservation of mass).
If we start out with ten carbon atoms, we need to end up with ten carbon atoms.
John Dalton’ atomic theory said that chemical reactions basically involve the rearrangement of atoms.
Chemical equations need to follow these principles in order to be correct.
Balancing Chemical Equations
A balanced equation is a chemical equation in which mass is conserved and there are equal numbers of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
We can write a chemical equation for the reaction of carbon with hydrogen gas to form methane (CH 4 ).
& \quad \ \text{C}(s) \quad \quad + \quad \text{H}_2 (g) \quad \quad \rightarrow \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{CH}_4(g)\\& 2 \ \text{C atoms} \quad \quad 2 \ \text{H atoms} \quad \quad \quad 1 \ \text{C atom}, 4 \ \text{H atoms}
In order to write a correct equation, you must first write the correct skeleton equation with the correct chemical formulas.
Recall that hydrogen is a diatomic molecule and so is written as H 2 .
When we count the number of atoms of both elements, shown under the equation, we see that the equation is not balanced.
There are only 2 atoms of hydrogen on the reactant side of the equation, while there are 4 atoms of hydrogen on the product side.
We can balance the above equation by adding a coefficient of 2 in front of the formula for hydrogen.
\text{C}(s)+2\text{H}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CH}_4 (g)
