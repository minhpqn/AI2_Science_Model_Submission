Discuss how your muscles continue to work for you even when your respiratory and cardiovascular system can no longer keep up a continuous supply of oxygen.
Is there enough ATP?
Yes.
But not to keep this effort up for a long time.
Short spurts of sprinting are sustained by fermentation in muscle cells.
This produces just enough ATP to allow these short bursts of increased activity.
Lactic Acid Fermentation:
Muscle Cells and Yogurt
For chicken or turkey dinners, do you prefer light meat or dark?
Do you consider yourself a sprinter or a long distance runner?
What is the biological difference between light meat or dark meat?
Or between the two types of runners?
Would you believe it has something to do with muscle color?
Light meat or dark?
Sprinting or endurance?
Muscle cells know two ways of making ATP â€“ aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
Are Drumsticks and Athletic Prowess Related?
Muscle color reflects its specialization for aerobic or anaerobic metabolism.
Although humans are obligate aerobes , our muscle cells have not given up on ancient pathways which allow them to keep producing ATP quickly when oxygen runs low.
The difference is more pronounced in chickens and grouse ( Figure below ), which stand around all day on their legs.
