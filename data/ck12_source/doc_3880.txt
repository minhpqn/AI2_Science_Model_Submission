Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and uses it to make organic compounds.
Carbon dioxide is given off when dead organisms and other organic materials decompose.
Burning organic material, such as fossil fuels, releases carbon dioxide.
Carbon cycles far more slowly through geological processes such as sedimentation .
Carbon may be stored in sedimentary rock for millions of years.
When volcanoes erupt, they give off carbon dioxide that is stored in the mantle.
Carbon dioxide is released when limestone is heated during the production of cement.
Ocean water releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when water temperature rises.
Carbon dioxide is also removed when ocean water cools and dissolves more carbon dioxide from the air.
Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years.
Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis.
In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.
Carbon must be recycled through living organisms or it stays in the atmosphere.
Carbon cycles quickly between organisms and the atmosphere.
Due to human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years.
