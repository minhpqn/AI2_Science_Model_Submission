A wave caused by a disturbance with more energy has greater amplitude.
Imagine dropping a small pebble into a pond of still water.
Tiny ripples will move out from the disturbance in concentric circles.
The ripples are low-amplitude waves with very little energy.
Now imagine throwing a big boulder into the pond.
Very large waves will be generated by the disturbance.
These waves are high-amplitude waves and have a great deal of energy.
Wave amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave passes through.
Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height between a crest and the resting position.
Wave amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is compressed by the wave.
Wave amplitude is determined by the energy of the disturbance that causes the wave.
A wave caused by a disturbance with more energy has greater amplitude.
