It shows just the numbers of valence electrons in each of these groups.
For elements in groups 3â€“12, determining the number of valence electrons is more complicated.

Q:
Based on both periodic tables above ( Figures above and above ), what are examples of elements that have just one valence electron?
What are examples of elements that have eight valence electrons?
How many valence electrons does oxygen (O) have?
A:
Any element in group 1 has just one valence electron.
Examples include hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na).
Any element in group 18 has eight valence electrons (except for helium, which has a total of just two electrons).
Examples include neon (Ne), argon (Ar), and krypton (Kr).
Oxygen, like all the other elements in group 16, has six valence electrons.
Valence Electrons and Reactivity
The table salt pictured in the Figure below contains two elements that are so reactive they are rarely found alone in nature.
Instead, they undergo chemical reactions with other elements and form compounds.
Table salt is the compound named sodium chloride (NaCl).
It forms when an atom of sodium (Na) gives up an electron and an atom of chlorine (Cl) accepts it.
When this happens, sodium becomes a positively charged ion (Na + ), and chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl - ).
