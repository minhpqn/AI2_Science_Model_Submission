The four lobes of each of the sp 3 hybrid orbitals then overlap with the normal unhybridized 1s orbitals of each hydrogen atoms to form the tetrahedral methane molecule.
Electrons hybridize in order to form covalent bonds.
Nonequivalent orbitals mix to form hybrid orbitals.
Use the link below to answer the following questions.  Read only the sections on ammonia and water hybridization.
What are the bond angles in ammonia and in water?
What contributes to these unexpected bond angles?
What happens to the lone pair electrons in ammonia when hybridization occurs?
Does the same thing happen with water?
Why is carbon expected to form only two covalent bonds?
How many covalent bonds does carbon actually form?
What needs to happen to allow carbon to form four bonds?
hybridization:
The mixing of the atomic orbitals in an atom to produce a set of hybrid orbitals.
hybrid orbitals:
The atomic orbitals obtained when two or more nonequivalent orbitals form the same atom combine in preparation for bond formation.
Hybrid Orbitals - sp and sp2
Describe the formation of sp and sp 2 orbitals.
Paired electrons are similar to Romeo and Juliet
How do you open the closed circle?
Romeo and Juliet were two of the great lovers of all time.
