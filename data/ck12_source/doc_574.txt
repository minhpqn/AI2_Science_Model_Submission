How is egg different from sperm?
Egg and sperm are both gametes, or reproductive cells.

The egg also does not have a tail.
And the female only releases one egg at time, while the male releases millions of sperm at a time.
Eggs and Egg Production
When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain all of the eggs they will ever produce.
But these eggs are not fully developed.
They develop only after she starts having menstrual periods at about age 12 or 13.
Just one egg develops each month.
