Compare and contrast the reactivity of beryllium (Be) and barium (Ba).
Identify transition metals.
List properties of transition metals.
Describe the lanthanides and actinides.
What do all of the objects pictured above have in common?
All of them are made completely or primarily of copper.
Copper has an amazing variety of uses, including cooking pots, plumbing pipes, roofing tiles, jewelry, musical instruments, and electric wires.
Copper is a good choice for these and many other objects because of its properties.
It can be formed into wires and flat sheets, it’s a great conductor of heat and electricity, it’s hard and strong, and it doesn’t corrode easily.
In all these ways, copper is a typical transition metal.
What Are Transition Metals?
Transition metals are all the elements in groups 3–12 of the periodic table.
In the periodic table pictured in Figure below , they are the elements shaded yellow, pink, and purple.
The transition metals make up about 60 percent of all known elements.
In addition to copper (Cu), well known examples of transition metals include iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) (Copper (Cu) is pictured in its various applications in the opening image).
