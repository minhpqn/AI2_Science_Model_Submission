Diana raises a 1000.
N piano a distance of 5.00 m using a set of pulleys.  She pulls in 20.0 m of rope.
How much effort force did Diana apply if this was an ideal machine?
What force was used to overcome friction if the actual effort force was 300.
N?
What was the work output?
What was the ideal mechanical advantage?
What was the actual mechanical advantage, if the input force was 300N?
A moverâ€™s dolly is used to pull a 115 kg refrigerator up a ramp into a house.
The ramp is 2.10 m long and rises 0.850 m.
The mover exerts a force of 496 N up the ramp.
How much work does the mover do?
How much work is spent overcoming friction?
What is the ideal mechanical advantage of a screw whose head has a diameter of 0.812 cm and whose thread width is 0.318 cm?
simple machine:
A mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force.
ideal machine:
An ideal simple machine in one in which the work input equals the work output.
effort force:  The force used to move an object over a distance.
resistance force:
