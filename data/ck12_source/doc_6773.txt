What is its speed when it gets to the bottom of the cliff?
\sqrt{ \frac{2g}{h} }
None of the above
In the picture above, a 9.0 \;\mathrm{kg} baby on a skateboard is about to be launched horizontally.
The spring constant is 300 \;\mathrm{N/m} and the spring is compressed 0.4 \;\mathrm{m} .
For the following questions, ignore the small energy loss due to the friction in the wheels of the skateboard and the rotational energy used up to make the wheels spin.
What is the speed of the baby after the spring has reached its uncompressed length?
After being launched, the baby encounters a hill 7 \;\mathrm{m} high.
Will the baby make it to the top?
If so, what is his speed at the top?
If not, how high does he make it?
Are you finally convinced that your authors have lost their minds?
Look at that picture!
When the biker is at the top of the ramp shown above, he has a speed of 10 \;\mathrm{m/s} and is at a height of 25\;\mathrm{m} .
The bike and person have a total mass of 100 \;\mathrm{kg} .
He speeds into the contraption at the end of the ramp, which slows him to a stop.
What is his initial total energy? (Hint:
Set U_g = 0 at the very bottom of the ramp.)
What is the length of the spring when it is maximally compressed by the biker? (Hint:
The spring does not compress all the way to the ground so there is still some gravitational potential energy.
