Today, most electronic signals are digital signals.
Digital signals consist of rapid pulses of voltage that repeatedly switch the current off and on.
The Figure below represents digital signals.
This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0’s (current off) and 1’s (current on).
This is called a binary (“two-digit”) code.
The majority of modern electronic devices, including computers and many mobile phones, encode data as digital signals.
Compared with analog signals, digital signals are easier to transmit and more accurate.
Typical digital signal
A message encoded by changing the voltage of an electric current is called an electronic signal.
The use of electric current for this purpose is known as electronics.
Electronic signals may be analog or digital signals.
Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage in an electric circuit.
Digital signals, which are the main type of signals used today, consist of rapid pulses of voltage that repeatedly switch the current off and on.
