The mirror in the opening photo is a plane mirror.
This is the most common type of mirror.
It has a flat reflective surface and forms only virtual images.
The image formed by a plane mirror is also right-side up and life sized.
But something is different about the image compared with the real object in front of the mirror.
Left and right are reversed.
Look at the girl brushing her teeth in the Figure below .
She is using her left hand to brush her teeth, but her image (on the left) appears to be brushing her teeth with the right hand.
All plane mirrors reverse left and right in this way.
The term mirror image refers to how left and right are reversed in an image compared with the object.

Some mirrors have a curved rather than flat surface.
Curved mirrors can be concave or convex.
A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl.
This type of mirror forms either real or virtual images, depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point.
The focal point is the point in front of the mirror where the reflected rays meet.
You can see how concave mirrors form images in the Figure below and at the following URL.
Concave mirrors are used behind car headlights.
They focus the light and make it brighter.
Concave mirrors are also used in some telescopes.
