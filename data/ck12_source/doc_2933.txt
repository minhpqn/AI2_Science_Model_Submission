A gene or piece of DNA is put in a vector , or carrier molecule, producing a recombinant DNA molecule.
The vector is placed into a host cell, such as a bacterium.
The gene is copied (or cloned) inside of the bacterium.
As the bacterial DNA is copied, so is the vector DNA.
As the bacteria divide, the recombinant DNA molecules are divided between the new cells.
Over a 12- to 24-hour period, millions of copies of the cloned DNA are made.
The cloned DNA can produce a protein (like insulin) that can be used in medicine or in research.
Bacteria have small rings of DNA in the cytoplasm, called plasmids ( Figure below ).
A plasmid is not part of the bacterial chromosome, but an additional pieced of DNA.
When putting foreign DNA into a bacterium, the plasmids are often used as a vector.
Viruses can also be used as vectors.
The manipulation of the plasmid DNA, and then the insertion of the recombinant plasmid into a bacterium, is an invaluable tool in scientific research.
Drawing of a plasmid, a DNA loop inside a bacteria
This image shows a drawing of a plasmid.
The plasmid has two large segments and one small segment depicted.
The two large segments (green and blue) indicate antibiotic resistances usually used in a screening procedure.
The antibiotic resistance segments ensure only bacteria with the plasmid will grow.
The small segment (red) indicates an origin of replication.
The origin of replication is where DNA replication starts, copying the plasmid.
Recombinant DNA is the combination of DNA from two different sources.
