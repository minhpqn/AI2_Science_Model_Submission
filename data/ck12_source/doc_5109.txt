Compare conjugation, transformation, and transduction.
How can bacteria reproduce so rapidly?
Bacteria can divide very rapidly.
This image is of a growing colony of E. coli bacteria.
In the right environment, a single E. coli can divide to form a colony of hundreds of bacteria in just a few hours.
Bacteria, being single-celled prokaryotic organisms, do not have a male or female version.
Bacteria reproduce asexually.
In asexual reproduction , the "parent" produces a genetically identical copy of itself.
Bacteria reproduce through a process called binary fission .
