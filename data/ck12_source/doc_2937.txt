It is now possible to find out a person's entire genetic code by determining all the bases in his or her DNA.
What might be the benefits?
Human Genome Project
A person’s genome is all of his or her genetic information.
In other words, the human genome is all the information that makes us human.
And unless you have an identical twin, your genome is unique.
No one else has a genome just like yours, though all our genomes are similar.
The Human Genome Project ( Figure below ) was an international effort to sequence all 3 billion bases that make up our DNA and to identify within this code more than 20,000 human genes.
Scientists also completed a chromosome map, identifying where the genes are located on each of the chromosomes.
The Human Genome Project was completed in Though the Human Genome Project is finished, analysis of the data will continue for many years.
To say the Human Genome Project has been beneficial to mankind would be an understatement.
Karyotype of human chromosomes
To complete the Human Genome Project, all 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human body were sequenced.
Each chromosome contains thousands of genes.
This is a karyotype, a visual representation of an individual’s chromosomes lined up by size.
Exciting applications of the Human Genome Project include the following:
The genetic basis for many diseases can be more easily determined.
Now there are tests for over 1,000 genetic disorders.
The technologies developed during this effort, and since the completion of this project, will reduce the cost of sequencing a person's genome.
This may eventually allow many people to sequence their individual genome.
