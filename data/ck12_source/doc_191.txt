Understand the difference between position vs time and velocity vs time graphs.
In a footrace such as the one pictured, the initial velocity of a runner is zero
In a footrace such as the one shown here, the initial velocity of a runner is zero.
The runner increases his velocity out of the starting blocks and his velocity continues to increase as the race proceeds.
For the well-trained athlete, his highest velocity is maintained through the finish line.
The instantaneous velocity of an object is the velocity of the object at a given moment.
If the object is moving with constant velocity, then the instantaneous velocity at every moment, the average velocity, and the constant velocity are all the same.
Position vs Time Graphs
Consider a position versus time graph for an object starting at  t =0 and  x = 0 that has a constant velocity of 80. m/s.
A position versus time graph for an object starting at t=0 and x=0 that has a constant velocity of 80 m/s
The velocity of an object can be found from a position vs time graph.
On a position vs time graph, the displacement is the vertical separation between two points and the time interval is the horizontal separation.
The ratio of displacement to time interval is the average velocity.
This ratio is also the slope of the line.
Therefore, the slope of the straight line is the average velocity.
For the motion pictured above,
\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}=\frac{400. \ \text{m}}{5.0 \ \text{s}}=80. \ \text{m/s}
For accelerated motion (the velocity is constantly changing), the position vs time graph will be a curved line.
The slope of the curved line at any point is the instantaneous velocity at that time.
If we were using calculus, the slope of a curved line could be calculated.
