Environmental Impacts of Mining
Describe the environmental costs of mining.
Can you tell that this was a mine?
Mining can do a lot of damage to a region.
Mining companies are now supposed to return the land to its natural state when they are done.
Sometimes this works really well.

Mining and the Environment
Mining provides people with many resources they need.
But mining can be hazardous to the environment.
For surface mines, miners clear the land of soil and plants.
Nearby lakes and streams may be inundated with sediment.
The mined rock may include heavy metals.
These also enter the sediment and water.
Removing metals from rock may involve toxic chemicals.
Acid flow from a mine site will change the chemistry of a nearby stream or lake.
U.S. law states that once mining is complete, the land must be restored to its natural state.
This process is called reclamation .
A pit may be refilled with dirt.
