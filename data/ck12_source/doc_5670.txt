How many neutrons are present in this atom?
What is the mass number of a cobalt atom that has 27 protons and 30 neutrons?
mass number:
The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom.
Describe three isotopes of hydrogen.
State how isotopes are named.
Explain why many isotopes are radioactive.
Is this creature a space alien?
It may look alien, but the sketch is actually just a scientist wearing a special suit to protect himself from harmful radiation.
The scientist is working with radioactive chemicals called isotopes.
Not all isotopes are radioactive, but many of them are.
To understand why, you first need to know what isotopes are.
What Are Isotopes?
All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but some may have different numbers of neutrons.
For example, all carbon atoms have six protons, and most have six neutrons as well.
But some carbon atoms have seven or eight neutrons instead of the usual six.
Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes .
Many isotopes occur naturally.
Usually one or two isotopes of an element are the most stable and common.
Different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties.
