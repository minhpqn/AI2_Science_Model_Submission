Drill rigs can be small and closely spaced.
They can be large and solitary.
This is true, especially when they are in deep water offshore.
Oil is a thick, dark brown or black liquid.
It is found in rock layers of Earth's crust.
Oil is currently the most commonly used source of energy in the world.
How Oil Forms
The way oil forms is similar, in many ways, to coal.
Tiny organisms like plankton and algae die and settle to the bottom of the sea.
Sediments settle over the organic material.
Oxygen is kept away by the sediments.
When the material is buried deep enough, it is exposed to high heat and pressure.
Over millions of years, the organic material transforms into liquid oil.
The United States produces only about one-quarter as much oil as it uses.
The main oil producing regions in the U.S. are the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alaska, and California.
Geologists look for oil in folded layers of rock called anticlines ( Figure below ).
Oil moves through permeable rock and is trapped by the impermeable cap rock.
Anticlinal structural trap - trapping oil between rock layers
Oil (red) is found in the porous rock layer (yellow) and trapped by the impermeable layer (brown).
The folded structure has allowed the oil to pool so a well can be drilled into the reservoir.
