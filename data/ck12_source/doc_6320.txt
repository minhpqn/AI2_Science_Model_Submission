As the forward reaction proceeds, it begins to slow down as the concentrations of the H 2 and the I 2 decrease.
As soon as some HI has formed, it begins to decompose back into H 2 and I 2 .
The rate of the reverse reaction starts out slow because the concentration of HI is low.
Gradually, the rate of the forward reaction decreases while the rate of the reverse reaction increases.
Eventually the rate of combination of H 2 and I 2 to produce HI becomes equal to the rate of decomposition of HI into H 2 and I 2 .
When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions have become equal to one another, the reaction has achieved a state of balance.
A reversible reaction is defined.
