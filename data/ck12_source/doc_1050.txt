Some geologists study the Moon.
Others look for petroleum.
Still others specialize in studying soil.
Some geologists can tell how old rocks are and determine how different rock layers formed.
There is probably an expert in almost anything you can think of related to Earth!
Geologists might study rivers and lakes, the underground water found between soil and rock particles, or even water that is frozen in glaciers.
Earth scientists need geographers who explore the features of Earth’s surface.
They work with cartographers, who make maps.
Studying the layers of rock beneath the surface helps us to understand the history of planet Earth ( Figure below ).
Geologists ask a lot of questions.
They wonder what they need to know about earthquakes to be able to predict them in time to evacuate a region.
They ask what will happen to shorelines as sea level rises.
Some even wonder what would happen if the magnetic field reverses!
Geologists study folded rock layers to explain what happened over time
These folded rock layers have bent over time.
Studying rock layers helps scientists to explain these layers and the geologic history of the area.
Oceanography is the study of the oceans.
The word oceanology might be more accurate, since “ology” is “the study of.” “Graph” is “to write” and refers to mapmaking.
But mapping the oceans is how oceanography started.
More than 70% of Earth’s surface is covered with water.
