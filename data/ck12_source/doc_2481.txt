He published his results, along with detailed descriptions of his procedures and observations, in the 1660s.
These steps were unheard of in his day.
Mainly because of his careful research and the details he provided about it, Boyle has been called the “father of modern chemistry.”
It’s Crowded in Here
Imagine a container of gas molecules like the one in the Figure below .
The container in the sketch has a lid that can be pushed down to shrink the volume of the gas inside.
Notice what happens as the lid is lowered.
The gas molecules crowd closer together because there is less space for them to occupy and they have nowhere else to go.
Gas molecules have a lot of energy.
They are always moving and bouncing off each other and anything else in their path.
When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure.
Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space, because the greater crowding results in more collisions.
In other words, decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure.
If you go to the URL below, you can watch a simulation of this.

You Go Up and I’ll Go Down
As the volume of gas in the container pictured in the Figure above gets smaller, the pressure of the gas molecules becomes greater.
When two variables change in opposite directions like this, the variables have an inverse, or “upside-down,” relationship.
Q:
How could you show an inverse relationship with a graph?
