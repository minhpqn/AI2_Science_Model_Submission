Water near shore generally has more dissolved nutrients than water farther from shore.
This is because most nutrients enter the water from land.
They are carried by runoff, streams, and rivers that empty into a body of water.
Water near the bottom of lakes and the ocean may contain more nutrients than water closer to the surface.
When aquatic organisms die, they sink to the bottom.
Decomposers near the bottom of the water break down the dead organisms and release their nutrients back into the water.
Anglerfish live in the ocean.
Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes .
Organisms that live in marine biomes must be adapted to the salt in the water.
For example, many have organs for excreting excess salt.
Two ocean zones are particularly challenging to marine organisms: the intertidal zone and the deep ocean.
The intertidal zone is the narrow strip along the coastline that is covered by water at high tide and exposed to air at low tide (see Figure below ).
There are plenty of nutrients and sunlight in the intertidal zone.
However, the water is constantly moving in and out, and the temperature keeps changing.
These conditions require adaptations in the organisms that live there, such as the barnacles in Figure below .
The intertidal zone can be identified in by comparing these pictures of high tide and low tide
These pictures show the intertidal zone of the Bay of Fundy, on the Atlantic coast in Maine.
Can you identify the intertidal zone from the pictures?
Barnacles are adapted to the intertidal zone by anchoring to rocks
Barnacles secrete a cement-like substance that anchors them to rocks in the intertidal zone.
