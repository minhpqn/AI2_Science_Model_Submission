Describe Earth’s magnetic field.
Explain how Earth’s magnetic field protects organisms from solar radiation.
Describe how some animals use Earth’s magnetic field for navigation.
You may recognize the eerie green glow in this cold northern sky as the northern lights, or aurora borealis.
But do you know what causes the northern lights?
Earth’s magnetic field is a major factor.
Earth’s Magnetic Field
Like a bar magnet, planet Earth has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field over which it exerts magnetic force.
Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetosphere.
You can see it in the Figure below

Like an Umbrella
The sun gives off radiation in solar winds.
You can see solar winds in the Figure above .
Notice what happens to solar winds when they reach the magnetosphere.
They are deflected almost completely by Earth’s magnetic field.
Radiation in solar wind would wash over Earth and kill most living things were it not for the magnetosphere.
It protects Earth’s organisms from radiation like an umbrella protects you from rain.
Q:
Now can you explain the northern lights?
