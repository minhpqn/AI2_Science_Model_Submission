At present, there is no cure for HIV infection.
A vaccine against HIV could stop this disease, and such a vaccine is in development, though it could take many years before it can be given to prevent this virus.
The HIV particle budding out of this immune cell indicates that this cell is infected
In this picture, the large structure on the bottom is a human immune cell.
It is infected with HIV.
A new HIV particle is shown budding out of the immune cell.
AIDS is not really a single disease.
It is a set of symptoms and other diseases.
It results from years of damage to the immune system by HIV.
AIDS occurs when helper T cells fall to a very low level, making it difficult for the affected person to fight various diseases and other infections.
These people develop infections or cancers that people with a healthy immune systems can easily resist.
These diseases are usually the cause of death of people with AIDS.
The first known cases of AIDS occurred in 1981.
Since then, AIDS has led to the deaths of more than 35 million people worldwide.
Many of them were children.
The greatest number of deaths occurred in Africa.
It is also where medications to control HIV are least available.
There are currently more people infected with HIV in Africa than any other part of the world.
Well over 30 million people are living with HIV worldwide.
HIV causes AIDS by destroying disease-fighting cells produced by the immune system.
