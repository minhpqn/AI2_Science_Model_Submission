For an ecosystem to be stable, populations in that system must be healthy, and that usually means reproducing as much as their environment allows.
Do organisms reproduce yearly or every few years?
Do organisms reproduce for much of their life, or just part of their life?
Do organisms produce many offspring at once, or just a few, or even just one?
Do many newborn organisms die, or do the majority survive?
All these factors play a role in the growth of a population.
Organisms can use different strategies to increase their reproduction rate.
Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care.
This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure below ).
Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers.
Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity.
Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure below ).
In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies.
Two reproductive strategies used are altricial strategies with few helpless young and precocial strategies with many well-developed young
(left) A hummingbird nest with young illustrates an altricial reproductive strategy, with a few small eggs, helpless young, and intensive parental care. (right) The Canada goose shows a precocial reproductive strategy.
It lays a large number of large eggs, producing well-developed young.
Migration is the movement of individual organisms into, or out of, a population.
Migration affects population growth rate.
There are two types of migration:
Immigration is the movement of individuals into a population from other areas.
