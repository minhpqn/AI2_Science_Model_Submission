Though the final product of photosynthesis is glucose, the glucose is conveniently stored as starch.
Starch is approximated as (C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n , where n is in the thousands.
Starch is formed by the condensation of thousands of glucose molecules.

Avoid Misconceptions When Teaching About Plants at
Why is it more appropriate to say chloroplasts, rather than chlorophyll, are necessary for photosynthesis?
Why is much more than six water molecules necessary for photosynthesis?
Do plants absorb any green light?
Explain your answer.
Describe organisms that use chemosynthesis.
Is it possible to live in temperatures over 175°F?
It is if you're a Pompeii worm.
The Pompeii worm, the most heat-tolerant animal on Earth, lives in the deep ocean at super-heated hydrothermal vents.
Covering this deep-sea worm's back is a fleece of bacteria.
These microbes contain all the genes necessary for life in extreme environments.
Why do bacteria that live deep below the ocean’s surface rely on chemical compounds instead of sunlight for energy to make food?
Most autotrophs make food by photosynthesis, but this isn’t the only way that autotrophs produce food.
Some bacteria make food by another process, which uses chemical energy instead of light energy.
This process is called chemosynthesis .
In chemosynthesis, one or more carbon molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane, CH 4 ) and nutrients is converted into organic matter, using the oxidation of inorganic molecules (such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) or ammonia (NH 3 )) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight.
