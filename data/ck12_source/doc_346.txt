You can help keep your bones and skeletal system healthy by eating well and getting enough exercise.
Weight-bearing exercises help keep bones strong.
Weight-bearing exercises and activities work against gravity.
Such activities include basketball, tennis, gymnastics, karate, running, and walking.
When the body is exercised regularly by performing weight-bearing activity, bones respond by adding more bone cells to increase their bone density.
Did you know that what you eat as a teenager can affect how healthy your skeletal system will be in 30, 40, and even 50 years?
Calcium and vitamin D are two of the most important nutrients for a healthy skeletal system.
Your bones need calcium to grow properly.
If you do not get enough calcium in your diet as a teenager, your bones may become weak and break easily later in life.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones lose mass and become more fragile than they should be.
Osteoporosis also makes bones more likely to break.
Two of the easiest ways to prevent osteoporosis are eating a healthy diet that has the right amount of calcium and vitamin D and to do some sort of weight-bearing exercise every day.
Foods that are a good source of calcium include milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Non-dairy sources of calcium include Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli.
Many fruit juices, fruit drinks, tofu, and cereals have calcium added to them.
It is recommended that teenagers get 1300 mg of calcium every day.
For example, one cup (8 fl. oz.) of milk provides about 300 mg of calcium, or about 30% of the daily requirement.
Other sources of calcium are pictured in the Figure below .
Milk, cheese, orange juice, broccoli, and sardines are all good examples of calcium sources
There are many different sources of calcium.
