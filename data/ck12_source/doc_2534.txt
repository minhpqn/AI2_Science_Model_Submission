Nonetheless, from his research he developed one of the most important theories in all of science.
Based on his research results, he was able to demonstrate that atoms actually do exist, something that Democritus had only guessed.
Portrait of John Dalton
Dalton did many experiments that provided evidence for the existence of atoms.
For example:
He investigated pressure and other properties of gases, from which he inferred that gases must consist of tiny, individual particles that are in constant, random motion.
He researched the properties of compounds, which are substances that consist of more than one element.
He showed that a given compound is always comprised of the same elements in the same whole-number ratio and that different compounds consist of different elements or ratios.
This can happen, Dalton reasoned, only if elements are made of separate, discrete particles that cannot be subdivided.
From his research, Dalton developed a theory about atoms.
Dalton’s atomic theory consists of three basic ideas:
All substances are made of atoms.
Atoms are the smallest particles of matter.
They cannot be divided into smaller particles, created, or destroyed.
All atoms of the same element are alike and have the same mass.
Atoms of different elements are different and have different masses.
Atoms join together to form compounds, and a given compound always consists of the same kinds of atoms in the same proportions.
Dalton’s atomic theory was accepted by many scientists almost immediately.
Most of it is still accepted today.
However, scientists now know that atoms are not the smallest particles of matter.
