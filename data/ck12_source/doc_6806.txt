Use the graph of the sunspot cycle below to answer the following questions. (Note that this is real data from our sun, so it doesn’t look like a perfect sine wave.
What you need to do is estimate the best sine wave that fits this data.)
Estimate the period T in years.
When do we expect the next “solar maximum?”

Calculate periods, frequencies, etc. of spring systems in harmonic motion.
Students will learn to calculate periods, frequencies, etc. of spring systems in harmonic motion.
T = \frac{1}{f} ;
Period is the inverse of frequency
T_{\text{spring}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} ;
Period of mass m on a spring with constant k
F_{sp} = -kx  ; the force of a spring equals the spring constant multiplied by the amount the spring is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium point.
The negative sign indicates it is a restoring force (i.e. direction of the force is opposite its displacement from equilibrium position.
