While the crew of the HMS Beagle mapped the coastline of South America, they traveled to a group of islands called the Galápagos.
The Galápagos are a group of 16 volcanic islands near the equator, about 600 miles from the west coast of South America.
Darwin spent months on foot exploring the islands.
The specimens he collected from the Galápagos and sent back to England greatly influenced his ideas of evolution ( Figure below ).

The Galápagos Islands are a group of 16 volcanic islands 600 miles off the west coast of South America.
The islands are famous for their many species found nowhere else.
It was on these islands where Darwin began to develop his theory of evolution.
On the Galápagos, Darwin observed that the same kind of animal differed from one island to another.
For example, the iguanas (large lizards) differed between islands ( Figure below ).
The members of one iguana species spent most of their time in the ocean, swimming and diving underwater for seaweed, while those of another iguana species lived on land and ate cactus.
Darwin wondered why there were two species of iguanas on the same set of islands that were so different from one another.
What do you think?
Land and marine iguanas on the Galapagos Islands
The Galápagos iguanas are among the signature animals of the Galápagos Islands.
Here both a land iguana and a marine iguana are shown.
Darwin also observed giant tortoises on the Galápagos ( Figure below ).
These tortoises were so large that two people could ride on them.
Darwin noticed that different tortoise species lived on islands with different environments.
He realized that the tortoises had traits that allowed them to live in their particular environments.
