The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium.
For a given medium, sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures.
You can compare the speed of sound in dry air at different temperatures in the following Table below .
At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly, so it takes them longer to transfer the energy of the sound waves.
Temperature of Air
Speed of Sound Waves (m/s)
Q:
What do you think the speed of sound might be in dry air at a temperature of -20 °C?
A:
For each 1 degree Celsius that temperature decreases, the speed of sound decreases by 0.6 m/s.
So sound travels through dry, -20 °C air at a speed of 319 m/s.
The speed of sound is the distance that sound waves travel in a given amount of time.
The speed of sound in dry air at 20 °C is 343 meters per second.
Generally, sound waves travel most quickly through solids, followed by liquids, and then by gases.
For a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures.
