This type of transformer is called a step-up transformer.
Thatâ€™s because it steps up, or increases, the voltage.
Schematic of a step up transformer
When coil S has fewer turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is less than the voltage in the primary current (see Figure below ).
This type of transformer is called a step-down transformer because it steps down, or decreases, the voltage.

Q:
Both step-up and step-down transformers are used in the electrical grid that carries electricity from a power plant to your home.
Where in the grid do you think step-down transformers might be used?
A:
One place that step-down transformers are used is on the electric poles that supply current to homes.
They reduce the voltage of the electric current before it enters home circuits.
An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of an electric current.
A step-up transformer increases voltage.
A step-down transformer decreases voltage.
