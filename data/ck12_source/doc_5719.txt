What is the difference between the two helium electrons?
What does the Pauli exclusion principle state?
What does the two values for the spin quantum number allow?
Pauli exclusion principle:
No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.
Hund's Rule and Orbital Filling Diagrams
State Hund’s rule.
Apply Hund’s rule to the filling of orbitals.
Use orbital filling diagrams to describe the locations of electrons in an atom.
Electron orbitals are limited, like the weight on a bridge
Have you ever wondered what those load limit signs mean on a bridge?
The sign above says that nothing over five tons is allowed because it will do damage to the structure.
There are limits to the amount of weight that a bridge can support, there are limits to the number of people that can safely occupy a room, and there are limits to what can go into an electron orbital.
The last of the three rules for constructing electron arrangements requires electrons to be placed one at a time in a set of orbitals within the same sublevel.
This minimizes the natural repulsive forces that one electron has for another.
Hund’s rule states that orbitals of equal energy are each occupied by one electron before any orbital is occupied by a second electron and that each of the single electrons must have the same spin.
The Figure below shows how a set of three p orbitals is filled with one, two, three, and four electrons.
Diagram of Hund's rule in boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen
The 2p sublevel, for the elements boron (Z = 5), carbon (Z = 6), nitrogen (Z = 7), and oxygen (Z = 8).
According to Hund’s rule, as electrons are added to a set of orbitals of equal energy, one electron enters each orbital before any orbital receives a second electron.
