How did Lavoisier demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions?
Define synthesis reaction.
Describe an example of a synthesis reaction.
In this photo of Los Angeles, California, the air over the city is brown with smog.
A major component of smog is nitrogen dioxide, which is a toxic gas with a sharp odor.
Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the eyes and throat and trigger asthma attacks.
Where does this poisonous gas come from?
It forms when nitric oxide—from sources such as car exhaust—reacts with oxygen in the air.
This reaction is a synthesis reaction.
What Is a Synthesis Reaction?
A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more reactants combine to form a single product.
A synthesis reaction can be represented by the general equation:
A + B → C
In this equation, the letters A and B represent the reactants that begin the reaction, and the letter C represents the product that is synthesized in the reaction.
The arrow shows the direction in which the reaction occurs.
Q:
What is the chemical equation for the synthesis of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) from nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O 2 )?
A:
The equation for this synthesis reaction is:
2NO + O 2 → 2NO 2
