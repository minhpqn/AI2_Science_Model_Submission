The bubbles indicate that vapor is being formed, which lets you know that a chemical reaction is taking place.
Many chemical reactions are going on constantly inside your body.
In fact, there are probably thousands of chemical reactions occurring every second in every one of your cells.
And as all living things are comprised of chemicals, understanding how chemicals work is essential to understanding how living things work.
Chemicals of Life
If you pull a flower petal from a plant and break it in half, and then take that piece and break it in half again, and take the next piece and break it half, and so on, and so on, until you cannot even see the flower anymore, what do you think you will find?
We know that the flower petal is made of cells , but what are cells made of?
Scientists have broken down matter , or anything that takes up space and has mass—like a cell—into the smallest pieces that cannot be broken down anymore.
Every physical object, including rocks, animals, flowers, and your body, are all made up of matter.
Matter is made up of a mixture of things called elements.
Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances.
There are more than 100 known elements, and 92 occur naturally around us.
The others have been made only in the laboratory.
Inside of elements, you will find identical atoms.
An atom is the simplest and smallest particle of matter that still has chemical properties of the element.
Atoms are the building block of all of the elements that make up the matter in your body or any other living or non-living thing.
Atoms are so small that only the most powerful microscopes can see them.
Atoms themselves are composed of even smaller particles, including positively charged protons , uncharged neutrons , and negatively charged electrons .
Protons and neutrons are located in the center of the atom, or the nucleus, and the electrons move around the nucleus.
How many protons an atom has determines what element it is.
