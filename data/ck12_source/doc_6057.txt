Pressure cookers do not allow the vapor to escape and the vapor pressure increases.
Since water now boils at a temperature above 100Â°C, the food cooks more quickly.
A pressure cooker increases the boiling point of water, which allows for faster cooking
The effect of decreased air pressure can be demonstrated by placing a beaker of water in a vacuum chamber.
At a low enough pressure, about 20 mmHg, water will boil at room temperature.
A vapor pressure curve is a graph of vapor pressure as a function of temperature.
Boiling points are affected by external pressure.
