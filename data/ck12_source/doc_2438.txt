Q:
How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when matter changes state?
A:
You could find the mass of a quantity of liquid water.
Then you could freeze the water and find the mass of the ice.
The mass before and after freezing would be the same, showing that mass is conserved when matter changes state.
Burning and other changes in matter do not destroy matter.
The mass of matter is always the same before and after the changes occur.
The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed.
