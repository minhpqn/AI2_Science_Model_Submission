Crack!
Crash!
Thud!
That’s what you’d hear if you were in the forest when this old tree cracked and came crashing down to the ground.
But what if there was nobody there to hear the tree fall?
Would it still make these sounds?
This is an old riddle.
To answer the riddle correctly, you need to know the scientific definition of sound.
In science, sound is defined as the transfer of energy from a vibrating object in waves that travel through matter.
Most people commonly use the term sound to mean what they hear when sound waves enter their ears.
The tree above generated sound waves when it fell to the ground, so it made sound according to the scientific definition.
But the sound wasn’t detected by a person’s ears if there was nobody in the forest.
