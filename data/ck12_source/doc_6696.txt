28.9 \;\mathrm{m} south of starting point
No, even if you swim directly north the river will still take you south at 1 m/s
Explain the parabolic motion of a thrown object.
The aim here is to understand and explain the parabolic motion of a thrown object, known as projectile motion.
Motion in one direction is unrelated to motion in other perpendicular directions.
Once the object has been thrown, the only acceleration is in the y (up/down) direction due to gravity.
The x (right/left) direction velocity remains unchanged.
In projectile motion, the horizontal displacement of an object from its starting point is called its range.
Vertical (  y  ) speed is zero only at the highest point of a thrown object's flight.
Since in the absence of air resistance there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, this component of velocity does not change over time.
This is a counter-intuitive notion for many. (Air resistance will cause velocity to decrease slightly or significantly depending on the object.
But this factor is ignored for the time being.)
Motion in the vertical direction must include the acceleration due to gravity, and therefore the velocity in the vertical direction changes over time.
The shape of the path of an object undergoing projectile motion in two dimensions is a parabola.

Projectile Motion (PhET Simulation)
Determine which of the following is in projectile motion.
Remember that “projectile motion” means that gravity is the only means of acceleration for the object.
