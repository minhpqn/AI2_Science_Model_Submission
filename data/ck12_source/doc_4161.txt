Vascular plants evolved leaves to collect sunlight.
At first, leaves were tiny and needle-like, which helped reduce water loss.
Later, leaves were much larger and broader, so plants could collect more light.
With their vascular tissues and other adaptations, early vascular plants had the edge over nonvascular plants.
The could grow tall and take advantage of sunlight high up in the air.
Bryophytes were the photosynthetic pioneers onto land, but early vascular plants were the photosynthetic pioneers into air.
Diversity of Seedless Vascular Plants
Surviving descendants of early vascular plants include clubmosses and ferns .
There are 1,200 species of clubmoss and more than 20,000 species of fern.
Both types of vascular plants are seedless and reproduce with spores.
Two examples are pictured in Figures below and below .
Clubmosses look like mosses and grow low to the ground.
Unlike mosses, they have roots, stems, and leaves, although the leaves are very small.
Ferns look more like “typical” plants.
They have large leaves and may grow very tall.
Some even develop into trees.
Clubmosses are often confused with mosses
Clubmosses like these are often confused with mosses.
Ferns are rarely confused with mosses
There’s no confusing ferns with mosses.
