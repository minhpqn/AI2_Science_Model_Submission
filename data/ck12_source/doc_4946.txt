Water channel proteins allow water to diffuse across the membrane at a very fast rate.
Ion channel proteins allow ions to diffuse across the membrane.
A gated channel protein is a transport protein that opens a "gate," allowing a molecule to pass through the membrane.
Gated channels have a binding site that is specific for a given molecule or ion.
A stimulus causes the "gate" to open or shut.
The stimulus may be chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force, depending on the type of gated channel.
For example, the sodium gated channels of a nerve cell are stimulated by a chemical signal which causes them to open and allow sodium ions into the cell.
Glucose molecules are too big to diffuse through the plasma membrane easily, so they are moved across the membrane through gated channels.
In this way glucose diffuses very quickly across a cell membrane, which is important because many cells depend on glucose for energy.
A carrier protein is a transport protein that is specific for an ion, molecule, or group of substances.
Carrier proteins "carry" the ion or molecule across the membrane by changing shape after the binding of the ion or molecule.
Carrier proteins are involved in passive and active transport.
A model of a channel protein and carrier proteins is shown in Figure below .
Facilitated diffusion through the cell membrane.
Channel proteins and carrier proteins are shown (but not a gated-channel protein).
Water molecules and ions move through channel proteins.
Other ions or molecules are also carried across the cell membrane by carrier proteins.
The ion or molecule binds to the active site of a carrier protein.
The carrier protein changes shape, and releases the ion or molecule on the other side of the membrane.
The carrier protein then returns to its original shape.
