Identify the sites of the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain.
The Krebs Cycle - Advanced
Relate the history of oxygen in the atmosphere to the evolution of photosynthesis, aerobic respiration, mitochondria, and life on earth.
Describe the fate in eukaryotic cells of the pyruvate molecules produced by glycolysis if oxygen is present.
Recognize that for most organisms, if oxygen is present, the products of glycolysis enter the mitochondria for stage 2 of cellular respiration - the Krebs Cycle.
Trace carbon and hydrogen atoms through the Krebs Cycle.
Analyze the importance of the Krebs Cycle to cellular respiration by following the pathway taken by chemical energy.
What type of acid do these fruits contain?
Citric acid.
Citric acid is also the first product formed in the Krebs cycle, and therefore this acid occurs in the metabolism of virtually all living things.
Enticing clues - volcanic gases, vast iron ore sediments, and bubbles of ancient air trapped in amber – suggest dramatic changes during the history of earth’s atmosphere.
Correlating these clues with the fossil record leads to two major conclusions: that early life evolved in the absence of oxygen, and that oxygen first appeared between 2 and 3 billion years ago ( Figure below ) because of photosynthesis by the blue green bacteria, cyanobacteria.
The chemistry of cellular respiration reflects this history.
Its first stage, glycolysis , is universal and does not use oxygen.
Oxygen has increased in the atmosphere throughout the history of the earth.
Note the logarithmic scale, which indicates great increases after first photosynthesis (in bacteria) and then land plants evolved.
