Describe different types of solutions and give an example of each.
The properties of solutions is largely determined by the combination of solute and solvent
Have you ever been in a band?
Dixieland music arose in New Orleans in the early 1900s.
This driving style of music emphasized improvisation on the basic musical theme.
Much of the sound quality associated with this music is due to the brass instruments (including the trumpet, trombone, and tuba).
New Orleans is still the home of Dixieland, and the French Quarter echoes nightly to the sounds of this exciting music.
The focus of Water  was on water's role in the formation of aqueous solutions.
We examined the primary characteristics of a solution, how water is able to dissolve solid solutes, and we differentiated between a solution, a suspension, and a colloid.
There are many examples of solutions that do not involve water at all, or that involve solutes that are not solids.
The Table below summarizes the possible combinations of solute-solvent states, along with examples of each.
water in air
oxygen in nitrogen (gas mixture)
salt in water
alcohol in water
carbon dioxide in water
zinc in copper (brass alloy)
mercury in silver and tin (dental amalgam)
Our air is a homogeneous mixture of many different gases and therefore qualifies as a solution.
Approximately 78% of the atmosphere is nitrogen, making it the solvent for this solution.
