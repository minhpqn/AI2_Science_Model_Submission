Although crocodiles and alligators have a few differences, they are very much alike and belong to the same order, Crocodilia.
Alligators and Crocodiles
Crocodilia, containing both alligators and crocodiles, is an order of large reptiles.
Reptiles belonging to Crocodilia are the closest living relatives of birds.
Reptiles and birds are the only known living descendants of the dinosaurs.
Some would day that alligators and crocodiles actually look like small dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs that evolved wings are the ancestors of birds.
The basic crocodilian body plan ( Figure below ) is a very successful one and has changed little over time.
Modern species actually look very similar to their Cretaceous ancestors of 84 million years ago.
All species of crocodilians have similar body structures, including an elongated snout, powerful jaws, muscular tail, large protective scales, streamlined body, and eyes and nostrils that are positioned on top of the head.

Characteristics of Crocodiles
Crocodilians have a flexible, semi-erect posture.
They can walk either in a low, sprawled “belly walk,” or hold their legs more directly underneath them to perform the “high walk.” Most other reptiles can only walk in a sprawled position.
All crocodilians have, like humans, teeth set in bony sockets.
But unlike mammals, they replace their teeth throughout life.
Crocodiles and gharials (large crocodilians with longer jaws) have salivary glands on their tongue, which are used to remove salt from their bodies.
This helps with life in a saltwater environment.
Crocodilians are often seen lying with their mouths open, a behavior called gaping .
