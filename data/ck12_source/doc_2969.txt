Bicyclist accelerating on a downhill stretch
Q:
The cyclist slows down at the end of the race.
His velocity changes from 6 m/s to 2 m/s during a period of 4 seconds without any change in direction.
What was his average acceleration during these 4 seconds?
A:
Use the equation given above for acceleration:
\text{acceleration} & =\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\\ & = \frac{6 \ \text{m/s}-2 \ \text{m/s}}{4 \ \text{s}} \\\ & = \frac{4 \ \text{m/s}}{4 \ \text{s}} \\\ & = \frac{1 \ \text{m/s}}{1 \ \text{s}} \\\ & = 1 \ \text{m/s}^2
To calculate average acceleration when direction is not changing, divide the change in velocity by the change in time using the formula: \text{acceleration}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\\\
The SI unit for acceleration is m/s 2 .

During the final 5 seconds of a race, a cyclist increased her velocity from 4 m/s to 7 m/s.
What was her average acceleration during those last 5 seconds?
Show how to draw a velocity-time graph.
Explain what the slope of a velocity-time graph represents.
The sprinter in this image is just taking off from the starting blocks to run a short race down a straight track.
She starts in a burst of speed and will pick up even more speed during the first few seconds of the race.
Sheâ€™ll keep running at top speed until she crosses the finish line.
