When a mechanical wave encounters an impenetrable barrier, the complete wave pulse will be reflected and the reflected wave will be inverted.
The following video shows a wave machine in action.
Use this video to answer the questions that follow.

What happens to the wave when it is reflected from an open end?
What happens to the wave when it is reflected from a fixed end?
Draw a diagram showing a surface with a normal line.  On the diagram, show a wave ray striking the surface with an angle of incidence of 60^\circ .  Draw the reflection ray on the diagram and label the angle of reflection.
Light strikes a mirrorâ€™s surface at 30^\circ  to the normal.
What will the angle of reflection be?
If the angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray is 90^\circ  , what is the angle of incidence?
When a water wave is reflected from a concrete wall, will the reflected wave be inverted or upright?
If you tie a heavy spring to a light spring and send a wave pulse down the heavy spring, some of the wave will be reflected when the wave passes into the lighter spring.  Will the reflected pulse be upright or inverted?
reflection:
The change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated.
law of reflection:
Says the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected.
angle of incidence:
The angle formed by a ray incident on a surface and a perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence.
angle of reflection:
The angle formed by a reflected ray and a perpendicular to the surface at the point of reflection.
