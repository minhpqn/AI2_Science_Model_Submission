Substance involved in a chemical reaction that is present at the beginning of the reaction.
symbiont :
An organism in a symbiotic relationship.
Theory of Endosymbiosis :
Theory that proposes that eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria, evolved from ancient, free-living prokaryotes that invaded other prokaryotic cells.
Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions which transfer energy from glucose (deliverable or fuel energy) to ATP (usable energy).
Analyzing a campfire can clarify your understanding of cellular respiration.
A campfire breaks chemical bonds in wood, releasing stored energy as light and heat; respiration breaks chemical bonds in glucose, releasing stored energy and transferring some to 38 ATP; some energy is lost as heat.
This equation summarizes the process of cellular respiration:
In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria organize enzymes and electron carriers and compartmentalize ions so that cellular respiration proceeds efficiently.
Cellular respiration, in many ways the opposite of photosynthesis, shows the interdependence of producers and consumers.
Combined, the two equations demonstrate how energy flows and the carbon and oxygen cycle between organisms and environment.
