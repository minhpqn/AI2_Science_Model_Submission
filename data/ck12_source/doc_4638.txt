Explain the importance of the corpus luteum.
What's amazing about these cells?
Many things.
A human egg cell.
Just add sperm and you have the necessary ingredients for a new baby.
What's amazing about these cells is that they are all produced before the girl is even born.
Before the girl is even born, plans for the next generation have begun.
And that is the start of an amazing process.
At birth, a femaleâ€™s ovaries contain all the eggs she will ever produce.
However, the eggs do not start to mature until she enters puberty.
After menarche, one egg typically matures each month until a woman reaches middle adulthood.
The process of producing eggs in the ovary is called oogenesis .
Eggs, like sperm, are haploid cells, and their production occurs in several steps that involve different types of cells, as shown in Figure below .
You can follow the process of oogenesis in the figure as you read about it below.
Oogenesis.
Oogenesis begins before birth but is not finished until after puberty.
A mature egg forms only if a secondary oocyte is fertilized by a sperm.
Oogenesis begins long before birth when an oogonium with the diploid number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis.
It produces a diploid daughter cell called a primary oocyte .
The primary oocyte, in turn, starts to go through the first cell division of meiosis (meiosis I).
