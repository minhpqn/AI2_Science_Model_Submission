The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what they consume.
Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy.
For example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants.
The caterpillar pictured below ( Figure below ) is a herbivore.
Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments are also herbivores.
Carnivores feed on animals, either herbivores or other carnivores.
Snakes that eat mice are carnivores.
Hawks that eat snakes are also carnivores ( Figure below ).
Omnivores eat both producers and consumers.
Most people are omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables, and grains from plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals.
Dogs, bears, and raccoons are also omnivores.
Both caterpillars and hawks are consumers
Examples of consumers are caterpillars (herbivores) and hawks (carnivore).
Decomposers and Stability
Decomposers ( Figure below ) get nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes.
Through this process, decomposers release nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, back into the environment.
These nutrients are recycled back into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them.
They are passed to other organisms when they are eaten or consumed.
Many of these nutrients are recycled back into the soil, so they can be taken up by the roots of plants.
The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of the decomposers.
