It also shows that fitness may depend on the environment.
What do you think might happen if malaria was eliminated in an African population with a relatively high frequency of the S allele?
How might the fitness of the different genotypes change?
How might this affect the frequency of the S allele?
Natural Selection and Polygenic Traits
Sickle-cell trait is controlled by a single gene.
Natural selection for polygenic traits is more complex, unless you just look at phenotypes.
Three ways that natural selection can affect phenotypes are shown in Figure below .
You can also watch an animation comparing the three ways at the link below.
Stabilizing selection occurs when phenotypes at both extremes of the phenotypic distribution are selected against.
This narrows the range of variation.
An example is human birth weight.
Babies that are very large or very small at birth are less likely to survive.
This keeps birth weight within a relatively narrow range.
Directional selection occurs when one of two extreme phenotypes is selected for.
This shifts the distribution toward that extreme.
This is the type of natural selection that the Grants observed in the beak size of Gal√°pagos finches.
Disruptive selection occurs when phenotypes in the middle of the range are selected against.
This results in two overlapping phenotypes, one at each end of the distribution.
An example is sexual dimorphism .
