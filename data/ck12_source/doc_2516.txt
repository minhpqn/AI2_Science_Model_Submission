The weak nuclear force changes subatomic particles from one type to another.
When protons change to neutrons, this changes atoms of one element to atoms of a different element.
Do the atom builder activity at the following URL.
Use the activity to build a stable atom that has three protons.
Make sure you take atomic forces into account in your atom.
Include enough protons and electrons to avoid creating a charged or radioactive atom.
If you need help, read the atom builder guides listed at the bottom of the Web page.
Which subatomic particles are affected by electromagnetic force?
How does this force affect them?
What is the strong nuclear force?
How does it hold the nucleus together?
How does the weak nuclear force differ from the other fundamental forces inside the atom?
How can it change an atom of one element to an atom of a different element?
Define atomic number.
Explain what mass number represents.
Athletes wearing the same-colored jerseys are all on the same team.
In addition, each playerâ€™s jersey has a unique number to distinguish him from his teammates.
Imagine how confusing it would be if members of both teams wore the same-colored jerseys or all the members of a team had the same number on their jerseys.
How could you tell the athletes apart?
