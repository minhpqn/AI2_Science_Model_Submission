Single Covalent Bonds
A covalent bond forms when two orbitals with one electron each overlap each other.  For the hydrogen molecule, this can be shown as:
Electronic configuration of a hydrogen molecule
Upon formation of the H 2 molecule, the shared electrons must have opposite spin, so they are shown with opposite spin in the atomic 1 s orbital.
The halogens also form single covalent bonds in their diatomic molecules.  An atom of any halogen, such as fluorine, has seven valence electrons.  Its unpaired electron is located in the 2 p orbital.
Electronic configuration of a fluorine molecule
The single electrons in the third 2 p orbital combine to form the covalent bond:
Picture of electron distribution in a fluorine molecule
On the left is a fluorine atom with seven valence electrons.
On the right is the F 2 molecule.
The diatomic fluorine molecule (F 2 ) contains a single shared pair of electrons.  Each F atom also has three pair of electrons that are not shared with the other atom.  A lone pair is a pair of electrons in a Lewis electron-dot structure that is not shared between atoms.
The oxygen atom in the water molecule shown below has two lone pair sets of electrons.  Each F atom has three lone pairs.  Combined with the two electrons in the covalent bond, each F atom follows the octet rule.
Sample Problem 9.1:  Lewis Electron Dot Structures
Draw the Lewis electron dot structure for water.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem
molecular formula of water = H 2 O
1 O atom = 6 valence electrons
2 H atoms = 2 Ã— 1 = 2 valence electrons
total number of valence electrons = 8
