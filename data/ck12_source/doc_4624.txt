The male reproductive system has two goals: to produce and deliver sperm and to secrete testosterone.
Might seem simple.
But there are a number of complicated processes and structures - including over 100 feet of tubules - that go into these simple goals.
The male reproductive system has two main functions: (1) to produce sperm, the male gamete, and (2) to release the male sex hormone, testosterone, into the body.
Male Reproductive Structures
The reproductive system in both males and females consists of structures that produce reproductive cells, or gametes, and secrete sex hormones.
A gamete is a haploid cell that combines with another haploid gamete during fertilization.
Recall that haploid cells have one complete set of chromosomes; in humans that would be 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.
Sex hormones are chemical messengers that control sexual development and reproduction.
The male reproductive system consists of structures that produce male gametes called sperm and secrete the male sex hormone testosterone.
The main structures of the male reproductive system are shown in Figure below .
Locate them in the figure as you read about them below.

Organs of the male reproductive system include the penis, testes, and epididymis.
Several ducts and glands are also part of the system.
Do you know the reproductive functions of any of these structures?
The penis is an external genital organ with a long shaft and enlarged tip called the glans penis.
The shaft of the penis contains erectile tissues that can fill with blood and cause an erection.
