How do you make complex cells?
You start with simple ones.
The first cells were most likely primitive prokaryotic-like cells, even more simplistic than these E. coli bacteria.
The first cells were probably no more than organic compounds, such as a simplistic RNA, surrounded by a membrane.
Was it a phospholipid bilayer membrane?
Probably not — it was likely a simplistic membrane able to separate the inside from the outside.
Over time, as other organic compounds such as DNA and proteins developed, cells also evolved into more complex structures.
Once a cell was able to be stable, reproduce itself, and pass its genetic information to the next generation, then there was life.
