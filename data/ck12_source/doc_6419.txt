Different mole ratios occur for other polyprotic acids or bases with multiple hydroxides such as Ca(OH) 2 .
Reactions Involving a Weak Acid or Weak Base
Reactions where at least one of the components is weak do not generally result in a neutral solution.
The reaction between weak nitrous acid and strong potassium hydroxide is shown below.
In order to write the net ionic equation, the weak acid must be written as a molecule since it does not ionize to a great extent in water.
The base and the salt are fully dissociated.
\text{HNO}_2(aq)+\text{K}^+(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{K}^+(aq)+\text{NO}^-_2(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
The only spectator ion is the potassium ion, resulting in the net ionic equation:
\text{HNO}_2(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{NO}^-_2(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
The strong hydroxide ion essentially “forces” the weak nitrous acid to become ionized.
The hydrogen ion from the acid combines with the hydroxide ion to form water, leaving the nitrite ion as the other product.
The resulting solution is not neutral (pH = 7), but instead is slightly basic.
Reactions can also involve a weak base and strong acid, resulting in a solution that is slightly acidic.
The molecular and net ionic equations for the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia are shown below.
& \text{HCl}(aq)+\text{NH}_3(aq) \rightarrow \text{NH}_4\text{Cl}(aq) \\& \text{H}^+(aq)+\text{NH}_3(aq) \rightarrow \text{NH}^+_4(aq) \qquad \qquad (\text{Cl}^- \ \text{is spectator ion)}
Reactions between acids and bases that are both weak may result in solutions that are neutral, acidic, or basic.
Neutralization is defined.
Equations for acid-base neutralizations are given.
