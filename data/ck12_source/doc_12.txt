You may ask, "Why are so many frogs deformed?" Or, "Is there something in their environment causing these defects, like water pollution?" Yet, you do not know if this large number of deformities is "normal" for frogs.
What if many of the frogs found in ponds and lakes all over the world have similar deformities?
Before you look for causes, you need to find out if the number and kind of deformities is unusual.
So besides finding out why the frogs are deformed, you should also ask: "Is the percentage of deformed frogs in this pond greater than the percentage of deformed frogs in other places?"

Research Existing Knowledge About the Topic
No matter what you observe, you need to find out what is already known about your questions.
For example, is anyone else doing research on deformed frogs?
If yes, what did they find out?
Do you think that you should repeat their research to see if it can be duplicated?
During your research, you might learn something that convinces you to change or refine your question.
From this, you will construct your hypothesis.
Construct a Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation.
A good hypothesis allows you to make more predictions.
For example, you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is running into the pond and causing frogs to have extra legs.
If that's true, then you can predict that the water in a pond of non-deformed frogs will have lower levels of that pesticide.
That's a prediction you can test by measuring pesticide levels in two sets of ponds, those with deformed frogs and those with nothing but healthy frogs.
Every hypothesis needs to be written in a way that it can:
