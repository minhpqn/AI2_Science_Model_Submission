Once the sea water in these evaporation ponds has evaporated, the salt can be harvested.
Filtration is a separation method used to separate out pure substances in mixtures comprised of particles some of which are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material.
Particle size can vary considerably, given the type of mixture.
For instance, stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like bacteria, viruses, and protozoans.
Some water filters can filter out bacteria, the length of which is on the order of 1 micron.
Other mixtures, like soil, have relatively large particle sizes, which can be filtered through something like a coffee filter.

Mixtures can be separated using a variety of techniques.
Chromatography involves solvent separation on a solid medium.
Distillation takes advantage of differences in boiling points.
Evaporation removes a liquid from a solution to leave a solid material.
Filtration separates solids of different sizes.
