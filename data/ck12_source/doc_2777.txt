Explain why.
A:
The substrates (reactants) fit precisely into the active site of the enzyme like a key into a lock.
Being brought together in the enzyme in this way helps the reactants react more easily.
After the product is formed, it is released by the enzyme.
The enzyme is now ready to pick up more reactants and catalyze another reaction.

More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life.
Many enzymes are needed for the digestion of food.
Two examples are amylase and pepsin.
Both are described in the Figure below .
Amylase and pepsin are used in our digestive system
Enzymes are catalysts in living things.
They speed up biochemical reactions.
Under the conditions inside living cells, biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to support life without the help of enzymes.
Enzymes increase the rate of biochemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting.
More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life, and many help digest food.
Two examples are amylase and pepsin.
