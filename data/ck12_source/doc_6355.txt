The  K_{sp} expression can be written in terms of the variable s .
Because the value of the  K_{sp} is so small, we can make the assumption that the value of  s will be very small compared to 0.040.
This simplifies the mathematics involved in solving for s .
K_{sp}&=(s)(0.040)^2=0.0016 \ s=3.0 \times 10^{-16} \\s&=\frac{K_{sp}}{\left [\text{OH}^- \right ]^2}=\frac{3.0 \times 10^{-16}}{0.0016}=1.9 \times 10^{-13} \ \text{M}
The concentration of the zinc ion is equal to  s and so [Zn 2+ ] = 1.9 × 10 -13  M.
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The relatively high concentration of the common ion, OH − , results in a very low concentration of zinc ion.
The molar solubility of the zinc hydroxide is less in the presence of the common ion than it would be in water.
The common ion and common ion effect are described.
Calculations involving the common ion effect are described.
