Assume that the truck driver in the animation puts on the brakes just as the truck enters the picture, but the truck still crashes into the car.
Explain how inertia is involved.
What force affects the acceleration of the ladder after it leaves the truck?
What is inertia?
How does inertia affect the motion of an object?
What is the relationship between inertia and mass?
Jonathan and Cody’s older brother Josh, who is pictured in the Figure below , is standing at the top of a half-pipe at Newton’s Skate Park.
Gravity is exerting a downward force on the skateboard, as seen in the picture.
Why doesn’t it tip over the edge and start rolling down the side of the half-pipe?
Practice problem for understanding inertia
Newton's Second Law
State Newton’s second law of motion.
Compare and contrast the effects of force and mass on acceleration.
These boys are racing around the track at Newton’s Skate Park.
The boy who can increase his speed the most will win the race.
Tony, who is closest to the camera in this picture, is bigger and stronger than the other two boys, so he can apply greater force to his skates.
Q :
Does this mean that Tony will win the race?
A :
Not necessarily, because force isn’t the only factor that affects acceleration.
