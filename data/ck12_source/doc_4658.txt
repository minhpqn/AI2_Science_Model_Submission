Adulthood and Aging
Adulthood does not have a definite starting point.
A person may be physically mature by age 16 or 17 but not defined as an adult by law until older ages.
In the U.S., you can’t join the armed forces or vote until age 18.
You can’t buy or use alcohol or take on many legal and financial responsibilities until age 21.
