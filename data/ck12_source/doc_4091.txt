Explain how Lamarck, Lyell, and Wallace influenced Darwin's work.
How old is Earth?
Earth is now believed to be over 4.5 billion years old.
But during Darwin's time, most people believed that the Earth was only about 6,000 years old.
If Darwin hadn't learned about the work of geologists that suggested that the Earth was much older, he might have never have developed his theory of evolution.
When Darwin returned to England five years later, in 1836, at the end of his voyage, he did not rush to announce his discoveries.
Unlike other naturalists before him, Darwin did not want to present any ideas unless he had strong evidence supporting them.
Instead, once Darwin returned to England, he spent over twenty years examining specimens, talking with other scientists and collecting more information before he presented his theories.
Some of Darwin’s ideas conflicted with widely held beliefs, including those from religious leaders.
At that time, many people believed that organisms never change and never go extinct, and that the world was only about 6,000 years old, always existing in the same way, never changing.
These beliefs delayed Darwin in presenting his findings.
How did Darwin come up with his theories?
Charles Darwin was influenced by the ideas of several people.
Before the voyage of the Beagle , Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed the idea that species change over time.
However, Darwin differed with Lamarck on several key points.
Lamarck proposed that traits acquired during one’s lifetime could be passed to the next generation.
Darwin did not agree with this.
The findings of Charles Lyell , a well-known geologist, also influenced Darwin.
Lyell's writings taught Darwin about geology, paleontology, and the changing Earth.
Lyell's findings suggested the Earth must be much older than 6,000 years.
