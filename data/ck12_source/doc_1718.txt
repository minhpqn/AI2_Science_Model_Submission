Mercury can rise in the tube, because there’s no air pressing down on it.

Some of the most commonly used weather instruments.
Weather instruments collect data from all over the world at thousands of weather stations ( Figure below ).
Many are on land, but some float in the oceans on buoys.
There’s probably at least one weather station near you.
Other weather devices are needed to collect weather data in the atmosphere.
They include weather balloons, satellites, and radar ( Figure below ).
Weather stations, balloons, satellites, and radar are used to make weather forecasts
Weather stations collect data on land and sea.
Weather balloons, satellites, and radar collect data in the atmosphere.
Weather stations contain many instruments for measuring weather conditions.
The weather balloon ( Figure above ) will rise into the atmosphere until it bursts.
As it rises, it will gather weather data and send it to the surface.
Many weather satellites orbit Earth.
They constantly collect and transmit weather data from high above the surface.
A radar device sends out radio waves in all directions.
The waves bounce off water in the atmosphere and then return to the sender.
The radar data shows where precipitation is falling.
It’s raining in the orange-shaded area shown above.
