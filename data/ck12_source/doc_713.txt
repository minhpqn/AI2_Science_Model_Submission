Wave interference pattern
In the early 1800s, light was assumed to be a particle.
There was a significant amount of evidence to point to that conclusion, and famous scientist Isaac Newton's calculations all support the particle theory.
In 1803, however, Thomas Young performed his famous Double Slit Experiment to prove that light was a wave.
Young shined a light onto the side of a sealed box with two slits in it, creating an interference pattern on the inside of the box opposite the slits.
As seen above, interference patterns are characterized by alternating bright and dark lines.
The bright lines are a result of constructive interference, while the dark lines are a result of destructive interference.
By creating this interference pattern, Young proved light is a wave and changed the course of physics.
Calculating Wavelength from Double Slit Pattern
Using the characteristics of the double slit interference pattern, it is possible to calculate the wavelength of light used to produce the interference.
To complete this calculation, it is only necessary to measure a few distances.
As can be seen below, five distances are measured.
In the sketch, L  is the distance from the two slits to the back wall where the interference pattern can be seen. d  is the distance between the two slits.
To understand x , look again at the interference pattern shown above.
The middle line, which is the brightest, is called the central line .
The remaining lines are called fringes .
The lines on either side of the central line are called the first order fringes, the next lines are called the second order fringes, and so on. x  is the distance from the central line to the first order fringe.
Calculating wavelength from a double slit pattern
r 1  and r 2  are the distances from the slits to the first order fringe.
We know that the fringes are a result of constructive interference, and that the fringe is a result of the crest of two waves interfering.
