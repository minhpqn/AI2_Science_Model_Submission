Describe the key features of sponges.
Summarize feeding in sponges.
Do animals wash your dishes?
Natural sponges, like the one in the picture above, are actually animals taken from the sea!
The sponges in your home, however, were most likely never living things.
Most sponges used in kitchens today are made from unnatural materials.
Sponges ( Figure below ) are classified in the phylum Porifera, from the Latin words meaning "having pores." These pores allow the movement of water into the spongesâ€™ sac-like bodies.
Sponges must pump water through their bodies in order to eat.
Because sponges are sessile , meaning they cannot move, they filter water to obtain their food.
They are, therefore, known as filter feeders.
Filter feeders must filter the water to separate out the organisms and nutrients they want to eat from those they do not.
Sea sponges often have tube-like bodies with many tiny pores
The sponges often have tube-like bodies with many tiny pores.
There are roughly 5,000 sponge species.
You might think that sponges don't look like animals at all.
They don't have a head or legs.
Internally, they do not have brains, stomachs, or other organs.
This is because sponges evolved much earlier than other animals.
In fact, sponges do not even have true tissues.
Instead, their bodies are made up of specialized cells (cell-level organization) that do specific jobs.
