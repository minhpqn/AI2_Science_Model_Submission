For example, up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and down quarks have a charge of -1/3.
Quarks also have a different type of charge, called color charge, although it has nothing to do with the colors that we see.
Quarks are never found alone but instead always occur in groups of two or three quarks.
There are also six types of leptons, including electrons.
Leptons have an electric charge of either -1 or 0.
Electrons, for example, have a charge of -1.
Leptons have mass, although the mass of electrons is extremely small.
There are four known types of bosons, which are force-carrying particles.
Each of these bosons carries a different fundamental force between interacting particles.
In addition, there is a particle which may exist, called the "Higgs Boson", which gives objects the masses they have.
Some types of bosons have mass; others are massless.
Bosons have an electric charge of +1, -1, or
Q:
Protons consist of three quarks: two up quarks and one down quark.
Neutrons also consist of three quarks: two down quarks and one up quark.
Based on this information, what is the total electric charge of a proton?
Of a neutron?
A:
These combinations of quarks give protons a total electric charge of +1 (2/3 + 2/3 â€“ 1/3 = 1) and neutrons a total electric charge of 0
The interactions of matter particles are subject to four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.
