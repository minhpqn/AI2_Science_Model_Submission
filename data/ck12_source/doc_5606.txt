Picture of a farm
How has farming evolved?
As farming becomes more expensive and less profitable (at least for small farms), many families will sell the land to builders who want to erect either commercial or residential properties.
In order to sell, an accurate property tile is needed.
The dimensions of the farm must be determined and the acreage calculated from those dimensions.
Dimensional Analysis and Derived Units
Some units are combinations of SI base units.
A derived unit is a unit that results from a mathematical combination of SI base units.
We have already discussed volume and energy as two examples of derived units.
Some others are listed in the Table below :
