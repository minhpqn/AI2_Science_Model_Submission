This is called molting .
The jointed appendages of arthropods may be used as legs for walking.
Being jointed makes them more flexible.
Try walking or climbing stairs without bending your knees, and youâ€™ll see why joints are helpful.
In most arthropods, the appendages on the head have been modified for other functions.
Figure below shows some of head appendages found in arthropods.
Sensory organs such as eyes are also found on the head.

Arthropod Head.
Arthropods have evolved a variety of specialized appendages and other structures on their head.
Some arthropods have special excretory structures.
They are called coxal glands and Malpighian tubules .
Coxal glands collect and concentrate liquid waste from blood.
They excrete the waste from the body through a pore.
Malphigian tubules carry waste from the digestive tract to the anus.
The waste is excreted through the anus.
Like mollusks and annelids, aquatic arthropods may have gills to exchange gases with the water (discussed below).
Terrestrial arthropods, on the other hand, have special respiratory structures to exchange gases with the air.
These are described in Figure below .
