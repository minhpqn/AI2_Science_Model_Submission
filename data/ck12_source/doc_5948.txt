Converting Moles to Mass
Chromium metal is used for decorative electroplating of car bumpers and other surfaces.  Find the mass of 0.560 moles of chromium.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
molar mass of Cr = 52.00 g mol
0.560 mol Cr
0.560 mol Cr = ? g
One conversion factor will allow us to convert from the moles of Cr to mass.
Step 2:
Calculate.
0.560 \ \text{mol Cr} \times \frac{52.00 \ \text{g} \ \text{Cr}}{1 \ \text{mol Cr}}=29.1 \ \text{g Cr}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Since the desired amount was slightly more than one half of a mole, the mass should be slightly more than one half of the molar mass.  The answer has three significant figures because of the 0.560 mol.
A similar conversion factor utilizing molar mass can be used to convert from the mass of an substance to moles.  In a laboratory situation, you may perform a reaction and produce a certain amount of a product which can be massed.  It will often then be necessary to determine the number of moles of the product that was formed.  The next problem illustrates this situation.
Sample Problem:
Converting Mass to Moles
A certain reaction produces 2.81 g of copper(II) hydroxide, Cu(OH) 2 .  Determine the number of moles produced in the reaction.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
