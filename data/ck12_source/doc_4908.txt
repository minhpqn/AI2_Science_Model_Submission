Outline the form and function of ribosomes.
Where are proteins made?
Proteins are made on ribosomes.
The chemical structure of a ribosome is shown above.
A ribosome is an organelle made out of just protein and RNA.
Its role in protein synthesis is extremely important.
And it is the structure of the ribosome that allows it to function as it does.
Ribosomes are small organelles and are the site of protein synthesis (translation).
Ribosomes can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm.
They can also be attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, and others are attached to the nuclear envelope.
Unlike other organelles, ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane.
Translation is the process of ordering the amino acids in the assembly of a protein.
The word ribosome comes from ribo nucleic acid and the Greek soma (meaning body).
Two Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work relating to the ribosome.
The 1974 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Albert Claude, Christian de Duve and George Emil Palade for the discovery of the ribosome, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A.
Steitz and Ada E.
Yonath for discovering the detailed structure and mechanism of the ribosome.
Ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions, such as translation.
Ribosomes, which are just made out of rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and protein, have been classified as ribozymes , because the rRNA has enzymatic activity.
The rRNA is important for the peptidyl transferase activity that bonds amino acids.
