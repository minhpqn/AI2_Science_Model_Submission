His sweat is soaking up his shirt because he has so much thermal energy.
Jogging is hot work because of the heat from the sun and the hard work he puts into his run.
Sound energy is a form of mechanical energy that starts with a vibration in matter.
For example, the singerâ€™s voice starts with vibrations of his vocal cords, which are folds of tissue in his throat.
The vibrations pass to surrounding particles of matter and then from one particle to another in waves.
Sound waves can travel through air, water, and other substances, but not through empty space.
Nuclear energy is energy that is stored in the nuclei of atoms because of the strong forces that hold the nucleus together.
The energy can be released in nuclear power plants by splitting nuclei apart.
It is also released when unstable (radioactive) nuclei break down, or decay.
Q:
The fans at a rock concert also produce or use several forms of energy.
What are they?
A:
The fans see the concert because of electromagnetic energy (light) that enters their eyes from the well-lit musicians on stage.
They hear the music because of the sound energy that reaches their ears from the amplifiers.
They use mechanical energy when they clap their hands and jump from their seats in excitement.
Their bodies generate thermal energy , using the chemical energy stored in food they have eaten.
Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many different forms.
Energy can also change from one form to another.
Forms of energy include mechanical, chemical, electrical, electromagnetic, thermal, sound, and nuclear energy.
