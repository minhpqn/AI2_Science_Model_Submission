Components of the central nervous system
This diagram shows the components of the central nervous system.
The brain is the most complex organ of the human body and the control center of the nervous system.
It contains an astonishing 100 billion neurons!
The brain controls such mental processes as reasoning, imagination, memory, and language.
It also interprets information from the senses.
In addition, it controls basic physical processes such as breathing and heartbeat.
The brain has three major parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem.
These parts are shown in Figure below and described in this section.

Parts of the brain
In this drawing, assume you are looking at the left side of the head.
This is how the brain would appear if you could look underneath the skull.
The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain.
It controls conscious functions such as reasoning, language, sight, touch, and hearing.
