They use mirrors and lenses to reflect and refract light and form images.
The light microscope and telescope use convex lenses and mirrors to make enlarged images of very tiny or distant objects.
A camera uses a convex lens to make a reduced image of an object.
A laser is a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just one wavelength and color.
Pulses of laser light carry communication signals through optical fibers.
At the following URL, practice using a telescope with the telescope simulator.
Select an object to view, and then try different combinations of aperture and eyepiece size.
For each combination, adjust the focus until the image is sharp and clear.
Make a data table to record 10 different combinations of aperture and eyepiece size and the resulting magnification.
Draw one conclusion based on the data in your completed table.
Explain how a compound microscope uses convex lenses to make an enlarged image of a tiny object.
Compare and contrast reflecting and refracting telescopes.
Write a paragraph explaining how a camera works.
Assume you are explaining it to a much younger student.
Draw a sketch as a visual aid.
Explain how reflection is involved in the production of laser light.
How are optical fibers used?
Vision and the Eye
Describe how the eye collects and focuses light.
Explain the role of the brain in vision.
