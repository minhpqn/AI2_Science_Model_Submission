For this part, we'll only add the value for the rod being rotated about one end and one of the masses because one of the masses is at the axis of rotation.
I&=\Sigma I_i = \frac{1}{3}mL^2 + ML^2\\\ I&=\frac{1}{3}.5\text{kg} * (3\;\text{m})^2 + 2\;\text{kg} * (3\;\text{m})^2\\\ I&=19.5\;\text{kg*m}^2\\\
(b):For the second part, we'll sum the moment of inertia's of both masses and the rod being rotated about it's center.
I&=\frac{1}{12}m(\frac{L}{2})^2 + 2M(\frac{L}{2})^2\\\ I&=\frac{1}{12}.5\;\text{kg}*(\frac{3\text{m}}{2})^2 + 2 * 2\;\text{kg} * (\frac{3\text{m}}{2})^2\\\ I&=9.1\;\text{kg*m}^2\\\

You have two coins; one is a standard U.S. quarter, and the other is a coin of equal mass and size, but with a hole cut out of the center.
Which coin has a higher moment of inertia?
The wood plug, shown below, has a lower moment of inertia than the steel plug because it has a lower mass.
Which of these plugs would be easier to spin on its axis?
Explain.
Even though they have the same mass, the plug on the right has a higher moment of inertia (I), than the plug on the left, since the mass is distributed at greater radius.
Which of the plugs would be harder to slow down?
Explain.
Use the moment of inertia table in the Key Equations section in order to answer the following questions:
Calculate the moment of inertia of the Earth about its spin axis.
Calculate the moment of inertia of the Earth as it revolves around the Sun.
Calculate the moment of inertia of a hula hoop with mass 2 \;\mathrm{kg} and radius 0.5 \;\mathrm{m} .
Calculate the moment of inertia of a rod 0.75 \;\mathrm{m} in length and mass 1.5 \;\mathrm{kg} rotating about one end.
Repeat d., but calculate the moment of inertia about the center of the rod.
