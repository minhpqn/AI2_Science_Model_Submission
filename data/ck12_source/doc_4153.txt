Each scale has a seed attached (right).
Later, seed plants called angiosperms evolved.
They produce flowers , which consist of both male and female reproductive structures.
The female reproductive structure in a flower includes an organ called an ovary .
Eggs form in ovules inside ovaries, which also enclose and protect developing seeds after fertilization occurs.
In many species of flowering plants, ovaries develop into fruits , which attract animals that disperse the seeds.
The evolution of seeds and pollen allowed plants to reproduce on land without moisture.
Flowering plants evolved flowers with ovaries that formed fruits.
They have been the most successful plants of all.
