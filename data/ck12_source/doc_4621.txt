It typically takes several years after infection with HIV for the drop in T cells to cripple the immune system.
What do you think explains the brief spike in T cells that occurs early in the HIV infection shown here?
AIDS is not a single disease but a set of diseases.
It results from years of damage to the immune system by HIV.
It occurs when helper T cells fall to a very low level and opportunistic diseases occur (see Figure above ).
Opportunistic diseases are infections and tumors that are rare except in people with immunodeficiency.
The diseases take advantage of the opportunity presented by people whose immune systems canâ€™t fight back.
Opportunistic diseases are usually the direct cause of death of people with AIDS.

AIDS and HIV were first identified in 1981.
Scientists think that the virus originally infected monkeys but then jumped to human populations, probably sometime during the early to mid-1900s.
This most likely occurred in West Africa, but the virus soon spread around the world (see Figure below ).
Since then, HIV has killed more than 25 million people worldwide.
The hardest hit countries are in Africa, where medicines to slow down the virus are least available.
The worldwide economic toll of HIV and AIDS has also been enormous.
HIV global rates of infection
This map shows the number of people in different countries with HIV infections and AIDS in 2008.
The rate of spread of the infection is higher Africa than in the U.S., yet the U.S. has a relatively large number of people with HIV infections and AIDS.
Why might there be more survivors with HIV infections and AIDS in the U.S. than in Africa?
