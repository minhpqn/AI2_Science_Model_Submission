The Fluid States
Pressure in Fluids
Calculate the pressure below the surface of liquids using the formula P=\rho gh .
Russian ocean submersible can withstand a great amount of pressure
This is the Russian ocean submersible “Mir.” Submersibles like this are necessary for research or work at great depths in the ocean because of the massive pressure.
This craft can operate as deep as 6000 meters below the surface.
The pressure at 6000 meters below the ocean surface exceeds 8500 pounds per square inch.
Pressure in Fluids
Pressure  is defined as force per unit area, where the force  F  is understood to be acting perpendicular to the surface area,  A .
The SI unit for pressure is N/m 2 .
This unit is also known as a pascal  (Pa): 1 Pa = 1 N/m 2 .
Example:  Consider a 80.0 kg person whose two feet cover an area of cm 2 .
Determine the pressure applied to the ground by his feet.
Solution:  The force exerted by this person on the ground would be (80.0 kg)(9.80 m/s 2 ) = 784 N.
The area over which this force is exerted would be 0.0500 m 2 .
P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{784 \ \text{N}}{0.0500 \ \text{m}^2}=15,700 \ \text{Pa}
It has been determined experimentally that a fluid exerts pressure equally in all directions.  In the sketch below, from any given point below the surface of the fluid, the pressure in all directions is the same.
The fluid exerts the same pressure upward from this point as it does downward.
Fluid exterting pressure equally below the surface
We can calculate how the pressure of a fluid varies with depth, assuming the fluid has uniform density.
