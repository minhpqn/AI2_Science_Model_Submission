According to Mendel's law of segregation, there are two hereditary factors for each trait that must segregate during gamete (egg and sperm) production.
As a result, offspring receive one factor from each parent, resulting in two factors for each trait in the offspring.

Mendel's Experiment at
In Mendel's experiments, did it matter if the dominant trait came from the seed plant or the pollen plant?
Yellow is a dominant trait in peas.
You breed two plants with yellow peas, and some of the offspring's peas are green?
How can this be?
Explain your answer fully.
For some of his experiments Mendel saw a 9:3:3:1 ratio, consisting of 9 yellow/smooth, 3 yellow/wrinkled, 3 green/smooth, and 1 green/wrinkled.
What did he conclude from this ratio?
Explain where these ratios came from.
What is the difference between a dominant trait and a recessive trait?
Explain the law of segregation.
When Mendel crossed a TT tall plant with a tt short plant, what did he observe in the F1 generation?
Why?
If PP purple plants are crossed with pp white plants, what will be the possible combinations of factors if the F1 generation is allowed to self-pollinate?
Explain the relationship between probability and genetics.
Use a Punnett square to make predictions about the traits of the offspring of a genetic cross.
What's the chance of the coin landing on heads?
