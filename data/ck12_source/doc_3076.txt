On the other hand, the hammer decreases the distance over which the force is applied.
The hand pushing down on the handle moves the handle over a distance of several inches, whereas the hammer pulls up on the nail only an inch or two.
Q :
Where is the fulcrum of the hammer when it is used to pull a nail out of a board?
In other words, around what point does the hammer rotate?
A :
The fulcrum is the point where the head of the hammer rests on the surface of the board.
Classes of Levers
Other levers change force or distance in different ways than a hammer removing a nail.
How a lever changes force or distance depends on the location of the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum.
The input force is the force applied by the user to the lever.
The output force is the force applied by the lever to the object.
Based on the location of input and output forces, there are three basic types of levers, called first-class, second-class, and third-class levers.
The Table below describes the three classes.
You can see animations of the classes, as well as more examples, at this URL:

Î” = fulcrum I = input force O = output force
The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever.
The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force.
The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine.
