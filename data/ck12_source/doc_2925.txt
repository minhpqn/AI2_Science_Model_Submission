Human Genetic Disorders
Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in one or a few genes.
Others are caused by chromosomal mutations.
Some human genetic disorders are X-linked or Y-linked, which means the faulty gene is carried on these sex chromosomes.
Other genetic disorders are carried on one of the other 22 pairs of chromosomes; these chromosomes are known as autosomes or autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes.
Some genetic disorders are due to new mutations, others can be inherited from your parents.
Autosomal Recessive Disorders
Some genetic disorders are caused by recessive alleles of a single gene on an autosome.
An example of  autosomal recessive genetic disorders  are Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis.
Children with cystic fibrosis have excessively thick mucus in their lungs, which makes it difficult for them to breathe.
The inheritance of this recessive allele is the same as any other recessive allele, so a Punnett square can be used to predict the probability that two carriers of the disease will have a child with cystic fibrosis.
Recall that carriers have the recessive allele for a trait but do not express the trait.
What are the possible genotypes of the offspring in the following table ( Table below )?
What are the possible phenotypes?
According to this Punnett square, two parents that are carriers ( Ff ) of the cystic fibrosis gene have a 25% chance of having a child with cystic fibrosis ( ff ).
The affected child must inherit two recessive alleles.
The carrier parents are not affected.
Tay-Sachs disease is a severe genetic disorder in which affected children do not live to adulthood, so the gene is not passed from an affected individual.
Carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene are not affected.
How does a child become affected with Tay-Sachs?
