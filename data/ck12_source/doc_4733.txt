Dolly the sheep is seen here on display in the National museum of Scotland.
In 1997, Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned, and quickly became world-famous.
She was euthanized in 2003 after she developed a common, but serious lung disease.
To “grow” her, researchers at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, collected DNA from a mammary cell of another sheep (technically her (older) twin sister), and then injected the DNA into a stem cell which had its own DNA removed.
That stem cell then developed into an embryo.
Because research may have a great effect on the well-being of individual people and society in general, scientists are required to behave ethically.
Scientists who conduct themselves ethically treat people (called subjects ) who are involved in their research respectfully.
Subjects are not allowed to be exploited deliberately, exposed to harm, or forced to do something they do not agree to.
