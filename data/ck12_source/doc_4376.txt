Why did amphibians evolve into reptiles?
It probably has to do with food and land.
Having to live close to water limits the resources available to a species.
Having the ability to live away from water allowed reptiles to search for additional food.
Structure and Function in Reptiles
Reptiles are a class of tetrapod vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs.
They include crocodiles, alligators, lizards, snakes, and turtles.
The reptile class is one of the largest classes of vertebrates.
It consists of all amniotes except birds and mammals.
Reptiles have several adaptations for living on dry land that amphibians lack.
For example, as shown in Figure below , the skin of most reptiles is covered with scales.
The scales, which are made of very tough keratin , protect reptiles from injury and prevent them from losing water.
Crocodile Scales.
These crocodiles are covered with tough, waterproof scales.
The scales of reptiles prevent them from absorbing oxygen through their skin, as amphibians can.
Instead, reptiles breathe air only through their lungs.
However, their lungs are more efficient than the lungs of amphibians, with more surface area for gas exchange.
This is another important reptile adaptation for life on land.
Reptiles have various ways of moving air into and out of their lungs.
Lizards and snakes use muscles of the chest wall for this purpose.
