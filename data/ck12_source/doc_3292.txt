If you’ve ever had your vision checked, you’ve no doubt been asked to read an eye chart like the one in this cartoon.
The patient in the cartoon must be having trouble making out the letters in the second row of the chart, because he asks the doctor for a hint (in the style of a popular TV game show).
The patient clearly has a vision problem.
Problems with Vision
Many people have problems with their vision , or ability to see.
Often, the problem is due to the shape of the eyes and how they focus light.
Two of the most common vision problems are nearsightedness and farsightedness, which you can read about below.
You may even have one of these vision problems yourself.
Usually, the problems can be corrected with contact lenses or lenses in eyeglasses.
In many people, they can also be corrected with laser surgery, which reshapes the outer layer of the eye.

Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects appear blurry.
The Figure below shows how it occurs.
The eyeball is longer (from front to back) than normal.
This causes images to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina.
Myopia can be corrected with concave lenses.
The lenses focus images farther back in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of in front of it.
