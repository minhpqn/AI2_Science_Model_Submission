How do you purify water?
Purification of water for drinking and other uses is a complicated process.
Heavy metals need to be removed, a process accomplished by addition of carbonates and sulfates.
Lead contamination can present major health problems, especially for younger children.
Lead sulfates and carbonates are very insoluble, so will precipitate out of solution very easily.

The known  K_{sp} values from the Table above can be used to calculate the solubility of a given compound by following the steps listed below.
Set up an ICE problem (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) in order to use the  K_{sp} value to calculate the concentration of each of the ions.
The concentration of the ions leads to the molar solubility of the compound.
Use the molar mass to convert from molar solubility to solubility.
The  K_{sp} of calcium carbonate is 4.5 × 10 -9 .
We begin by setting up an ICE table showing the dissociation of CaCO 3 into calcium ions and carbonate ions.
The variable  s will be used to represent the molar solubility of CaCO 3 .
In this case, each formula unit of CaCO 3 yields one Ca 2+ ion and one CO 3 2− ion.
Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations of each ion are equal to s .
& \text{CaCO}_3(s) \quad \rightleftarrows \quad \text{Ca}^{2+}(aq)+ \text{CO}_3^{2-}(aq) \\\text{Initial }(\text{M}) & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad 0.00 \qquad \quad \ 0.00 \\\text{Change }(\text{M}) & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad +s \qquad \quad +s \\\qquad \text{Equilibrium }(\text{M}) & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \ s \qquad \qquad s
The  K_{sp} expression can be written in terms of  s and then used to solve for s .
K_{sp}&=[ \text{Ca}^{2+}][ \text{CO}_3^{2-}]=(s)(s)=s^2 \\s&=\sqrt{K_{sp}}=\sqrt{4.5 \times 10^{-9}}=6.7 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{M}
