Wave on a String (PhET Simulation)
A violin string vibrates, when struck, as a standing wave with a frequency of 260\;\mathrm{Hz} .
When you place your finger on the same string so that its length is reduced to 2/3 of its original length, what is its new vibration frequency?
What is the new 3rd harmonic?
The length of the western section of the Bay Bridge is 2.7 km.
Draw a side-view of the western section of the Bay Bridge and identify the seven nodes in this section of the bridge.
Assume that the bridge is concrete (the speed of sound in concrete is 3200 m/s).
What is the lowest frequency of vibration for the bridge? (You can assume that the towers are equally spaced, and that the central support is equidistant from both middle towers.
The best way to approach this problem is by drawing in a wave that “works.”)
What might happen if an earthquake occurs that shakes the bridge at precisely this frequency?
The simple bridge shown here oscillated up and down pretty violently four times every second as a result of an earthquake.
What was the frequency of the shaking in Hz ?
Why was the bridge oscillating so violently?
Calculate two other frequencies that would be considered “dangerous” for the bridge.
What could you do to make the bridge safer? (Note that earthquakes rarely shake at more than 6 \;\mathrm{Hz} )
390 \;\mathrm{Hz} , 1170 \;\mathrm{Hz}
a. 3 wavelengths, 6^{th} harmonic b. 3.56 Hz c.
