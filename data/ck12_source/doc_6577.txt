What are the starting materials for an esterification reaction?
How can an ester be saponified?
condensation reaction:  A reaction in which two molecules combine to form a single molecule.
esterification:  A reaction in which an ester is formed from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.
saponification:  The alkaline hydrolysis reaction of an ester.
Polymerization – Addition Polymers
Define addition polymer.
Write reactions for the synthesis of addition polymers.
Give examples of addition polymers.
Landfill with non-decomposing Styrofoam
Will it ever go away?
We enjoy the benefits of Styrofoam ® containers, but don’t often think about where they end up.
Styrofoam ® materials do not break down quickly under exposure to the elements.
When buried in a landfill, styrofoam will remain intact for a long time.
The good news is that there is not a lot of this pollutant found in landfills (maybe about 0.5% by weight of the total mass of garbage).
There is no good way to recycle Styrofoam ® at present, but someday a creative scientist may come up with one.
Polymerization – Addition Polymers
Polymers are very different from the other kinds of organic molecules that you have seen so far.
Whereas other compounds are of relatively low molar mass, polymers are giant molecules of very high molar mass.
Polymers are the primary components of all sorts of plastics and related compounds.
