Of course there is.
The structure-function relationship describes a pattern evident throughout biological systems.
This relationship is evident in proteins (protein structure determines its function), nucleic acids (nucleic acid structure results in a genetic code), anatomy (longer necked giraffes are more functional than short neck giraffes), as well as cells.
Using the human body as an example, specialized cells perform many diverse functions, from digestion and excretion to message transmission and oxygen distribution.
The structure of each type of human cell depends on what function it will perform.
This structure-function relationship can be extended to all other organisms, from the largest whale to the smallest bacteria.
The variability between cell function is related to the proteins expressed in a particular type of cell.
For example, though they do have many proteins in common, a neuron is going to use select different proteins than muscle cell.
A direct relationship exists between the proteins expressed, the size and shape of every cell and the tasks it needs to accomplish.
Examples can easily be seen in red blood cells, neurons muscle cells and sperm cells.
Red blood cells are flat, round, and very small.
Their small size allows easy maneuverability through the capillaries, the narrowest blood vessels, where oxygen is transferred into body cells.
Neurons have a long, thin cellular extension, allowing for very quick and accurate communication and responses.
The long length allows a neuron to send electrical messages extremely quickly.
Skeletal muscle cells have an arrangement of linear protein fibers.
The elongated shape allows for muscle contraction.
Sperm cells are the only human cell with flagella .
This is because of their need to "swim" long distances to reach an egg for fertilization.
flagella (singular, flagellum ):
A tail-like appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; used for locomotion.
