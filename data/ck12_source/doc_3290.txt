The ability to see is called vision .
This ability depends on more than healthy eyes.
It also depends on certain parts of the brain, because the brain and eyes work together to allow us to see.
The eyes collect and focus visible light.
The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus an image on the retina.
The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in the Figure below .
Cells in the retina change the image to electrical signals that travel to the brain through the optic nerve.
The brain interprets the electrical signals as shape, color, and brightness.
It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up.
The brain does this automatically, so what we see always appears right-side up.
The brain also interprets what we are seeing.
Signal transmission from eyes to brain
Q:
The part of the brain that processes information from the eyes is the visual cortex.
It is located at the back of the brain.
How might an injury to the visual cortex affect vision?
A:
An injury to the visual cortex might cause abnormal vision or even blindness regardless of how well the eyes can gather and focus light.
The human eye is an organ that is specialized to collect light and focus images.
Light enters through transparent structures at the front of the eye.
