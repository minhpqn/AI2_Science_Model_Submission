Others include the Pacific decadal oscillation and the North Atlantic oscillation.
El Niño and La Niña are the most noticeable and discussed.
To understand El Niño and La Niña, you first need to know what happens in normal years ( Figure below ).
Diagram of the Pacific Ocean in a normal year
This diagram represents the Pacific Ocean in a normal year.
North and South America are the brown shapes on the right.
During an El Niño , the western Pacific Ocean is warmer than usual.
This causes the trade winds to change direction.
The winds blow from west to east instead of east to west ( Figure below ).
The change in the trade winds also causes the jet streams to be north of their normal location.
The warm water travels east across the Equator, too.
Warm water piles up along the western coast of South America.
This prevents upwelling.
Why do you think this is true?
These changes in water temperature, winds, and currents affect climates worldwide.
The changes usually last a year or two.
Some places get more rain than normal.
Other places get less.
In many locations, the weather is more severe.
