The second stage of prophase I; also known as zygonema, from Greek words meaning paired threads.
Meiosis is a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes.
There are eight stages of meiosis, divided into meiosis I and meiosis II.
DNA is not replicated between meiosis I and meiosis II.
Outline the phases of meiosis.
Compare and contrast meiosis I and meiosis II.
Compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis.
Explain why sexual reproduction results in genetically unique offspring.
Name and describe the processes shown in this diagram.
Genetic Variation - Advanced
Explain why and how sexual reproduction leads to variation in offspring.
What helps ensure the survival of a species?
Genetic variation.
It is this variation that is the essence of evolution.
Without genetic differences among individuals, "survival of the fittest" would not be likely.
Everyone would be exactly the same.
How would it be determined who could or would survive?
Either all survive, or all perish.
Meiosis and Genetic Variation
Sexual reproduction results in infinite possibilities of genetic variation.
