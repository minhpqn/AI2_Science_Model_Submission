It’s easy to convert temperatures between the Kelvin and Celsius scales.
Each 1-degree change on the Kelvin scale is equal to a 1-degree change on the Celsius scale.
Therefore, to convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, just add 273 to the Celsius temperature.
For example, 10 °C equals 283 Kelvin.
Q:
How would you convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius?
A:
You would subtract 273 from the Kelvin temperature.
For example, a temperature of 300 Kevin equals 27 °C.
Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complicated.
The following conversion factors can be used:
Celsius → Fahrenheit : (°C × 1.8) + 32 = °F
Fahrenheit → Celsius : (°F - 32) ÷ 1.8 = °C
For example, to convert 10 °C to Fahrenheit, use the first conversion factor:
(10 °C × 1.8) + 32 = 50 °F
Q:
The weather forecaster predicts a high temperature today of 86 °F.
What will the temperature be in Celsius?
A:
To convert 86 °F to Celsius, use the second conversion factor:
