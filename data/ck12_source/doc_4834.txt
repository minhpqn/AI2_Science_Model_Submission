This is represented by the chemical equation:
HCl + H 2 O → Cl - + H 3 O + .
Strong acids can be harmful to organisms and damaging to materials.
Acids have a sour taste and may sting or burn the skin.
Testing solutions with litmus paper is an easy way to identify acids.
Acids turn blue litmus paper red.
A base can be defined as a hydrogen ion acceptor.
It accepts hydrogen ions from hydronium ions, leading to a lower concentration of hydronium ions than in pure water.
For example, when the base ammonia (NH 3 ) dissolves in pure water, it accepts hydrogen ions (H + ) from hydronium ions (H 3 O + ) to form ammonium ions (NH 4 + ) and hydroxide ions (OH - ).
This is represented by the chemical equation:
NH 3 + H 2 O → NH 4 + + OH - .
Like strong acids, strong bases can be harmful to organisms and damaging to materials.
Bases have a bitter taste and feel slimy to the touch.
They can also burn the skin.
Bases, like acids, can be identified with litmus paper.
Bases turn red litmus paper blue.
What do you think would happen if you mixed an acid and a base?
If you think the acid and base would “cancel each other out,” you are right.
When an acid and base react, they form a neutral solution of water and a salt (a molecule composed of a positive and negative ion).
This type of reaction is called a neutralization reaction .
