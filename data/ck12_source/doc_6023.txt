One of the guest brings twenty brownies for dessert.
The decision about serving dessert is easy: two brownies are placed on every plate.
If someone wants more brownies, they will have to wait until they go to the store.
There are only enough brownies for everyone to have two.
Determining the Limiting Reactant
In the real world, amounts of reactants and products are typically measured by mass or by volume.
It is first necessary to convert the given quantities of each reactant to moles in order to identify the limiting reactant.
Sample Problem:
Determining the Limiting Reactant
Silver metal reacts with sulfur to form silver sulfide according to the following balanced equation:
2\text{Ag}(s)+\text{S}(s) \rightarrow \text{Ag}_2\text{S}(s)
What is the limiting reactant when 50.0 g Ag is reacted with 10.0 g S?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given: 50.0 g Ag
given: 10.0 g S
Use the atomic masses of Ag and S to determine the number of moles of each present.
Then, use the balanced equation to calculate the number of moles of sulfur that would be needed to react with the number of moles of silver present.
Compare this result to the actual number of moles of sulfur present.
Step 2:
