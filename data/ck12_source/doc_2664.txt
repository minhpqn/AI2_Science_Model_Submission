In a polar bond, one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other atom does.
In some polar molecules that contain hydrogen atoms, the partial positive charge of the hydrogen atoms of one molecule are attracted to the partial negative charge of an atom of a nearby molecule.
This force of attraction is called a hydrogen bond.
Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, but they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from each other when matter changes state from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas.
This explains why polar covalent compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points.
Watch the video about hydrogen bonds at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.
What is electronegativity?
In water molecules, why do shared electrons spend more time orbiting the oxygen atom than the hydrogen atoms?
Hydrogen forms hydrogen bonds with oxygen.
What is another element besides oxygen that may be involved in hydrogen bonds?
Water has the properties of cohesion and adhesion.
Define these two properties, and explain why they occur in water.
Why are hydrogen bonds extremely important in biology?
What are polar covalent compounds?
Define hydrogen bond.
Explain why hydrogen bonds increase melting and boiling points of polar covalent compounds such as water.
Describe metallic bonds.
Explain how metallic bonds influence the properties of metals.
The thick, rigid trunk of the oak tree on the left might crack and break in a strong wind.
The slim, flexible trunk of the willow tree on the right might bend without breaking.
