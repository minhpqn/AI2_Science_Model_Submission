Plants' Adaptations for Life on Land
Define cuticle, stomata, and vascular tissue as related to plants.
Distinguish xylem from phloem.
Describe plantsâ€™ major adaptations for life on land.
Where did plants come from?
Plants have not always been around on land.
For a long time, life was confined to water.
The first plants evolved from green algae that looked somewhat like the Chara pictured above.
Plants' Adaptations for Life on Land
The first photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the water.
So, where did plants come from?
Evidence shows that plants evolved from freshwater green algae, a protist ( Figure below ).
The similarities between green algae and plants is one piece of evidence.
They both have cellulose in their cell walls, and they share many of the same chemicals that give them color.
So what separates green algae from green plants?
