The chemical formula is C 6 H 12 O 6 , and the name of the compound is glucose.
In this article you’ll learn more about glucose and other compounds that are essential to life.
Introduction to Biochemical Compounds
Glucose is an example of a biochemical compound.
The prefix bio- comes from the Greek word that means “life.” A biochemical compound is any carbon-based compound that is found in living things.
Biochemical compounds make up the cells and tissues of living things.
They are also involved in all life processes, including making and using food for energy.
Given their diversity of functions, it’s not surprising that there are millions of different biochemical compounds.
Q:
Plants make food in the process of photosynthesis.
What biochemical compound is synthesized in photosynthesis?
A:
Glucose is synthesized in photosynthesis.
Virtually all living things use glucose for energy, but glucose is just one of many examples of biochemical compounds that are found in most or all living things.
In fact the similarity in biochemical compounds between living things provides some of the best evidence for the evolution of species from common ancestors.
A classic example is the biochemical compound called cytochrome c.
It is found in all living organisms because it performs essential life functions.
Only slight variations in the molecule exist between closely related species, as you can see in the Figure below .
The molecule is identical in humans and their closest relatives, the chimpanzees.
And even between humans and the single-celled tetrahymena (pictured in the Figure below ), the cytochrome c molecule is nearly 50 percent the same.
