Thus, gene regulation is the basis for cellular differentiation and morphogenesis.
Though gene regulation occurs at the cellular level, it controls the versatility and adaptability of any organism, from single celled organisms to organisms made of trillions of cells.
Gene regulation also has a role in natural selection and evolution, as the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a significant effect on the functions of the gene product, which can have a profound effect on the functions of a cell, tissue, organ, organ system or even organism.
Gene regulation of the bacterial lac operon was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be identified and described.
François Jacob and Jacques Monod (together with André Lwoff) were awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work (see
gene expression :
The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.
gene regulation :
The process that activates the expression of a specific gene.
lac operon :
An operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in E. coli.
operon :
A region of prokaryotic DNA with a promoter, an operator, and one or more genes that encode proteins needed to perform a certain task.
The regulation of gene expression determines which genes are expressed and when those genes are expressed.
This regulatory process is instrumental in determining the structure and function of a cell.
What is meant by gene expression, and why is this an important cellular mechanism?
At what stages of gene expression is regulation possible?
What is the lac operon?
