The first time an animal performs an innate behavior, the animal does it well.
The animal does not have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or become better at it.
Innate behaviors are also predictable.
All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way.
From the examples described above, you can probably tell that innate behaviors usually involve important actions, like eating and caring for the young.
There are many other examples of innate behaviors.
For example, did you know that honeybees dance?
The honeybee pictured below has found a source of food ( Figure below ).
When the bee returns to its hive, it will do a dance.
This dance is called the waggle dance .
The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food.
Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior.
When this honeybee goes back to its hive, it will do a dance to tell the other bees in the hive where it found food
When this honeybee goes back to its hive, it will do a dance to tell the other bees in the hive where it found food.
Besides building nests, birds have other innate behaviors.
One example occurs in gulls, which are pictured below ( Figure below ); one of the chicks is pecking at a red spot on the motherâ€™s beak.
This innate behavior causes the mother to feed the chick.
In many other species of birds, the chicks open their mouths wide whenever the mother returns to the nest ( Figure below ).
This innate behavior, called gaping , causes the mother to feed them.
