Photosynthesis at  .
What molecule "starts" the Calvin cycle?
What is transferred onto this molecule?
What happens to the energy from NADPH?
What is the first 6-carbon sugar to form during this process?
What happens to this sugar?
What happens during the carbon fixation step of the Calvin cycle?
What is special about RuBisCo?
What are stomata?
Explain what might happen if the third step of the Calvin cycle did not occur.
Why?
What is the main final product of the Calvin cycle?
How many turns of the Calvin cycle are needed to produce this product?
What is photosynthesis?
The process of using the energy in sunlight to make food (glucose).
Is it really as simple as that?
Of course not.
As you have seen, photosynthesis includes many steps all conveniently condensed into one simple equation.
In the five concepts describing photosynthesis, this process has been presented in an introductory fashion.
Obviously, much more details could have been included, though those are beyond the scope of these concepts.
