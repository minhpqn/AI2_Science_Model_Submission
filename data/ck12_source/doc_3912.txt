It begins with a plant that must be able to grow on new land with minimal soil or nutrients.
Communities are not usually static.
The numbers and types of species that live in them generally change over time.
This is called ecological succession .
Important cases of succession are primary and secondary succession.
Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized.
Generally, the area is nothing but bare rock.
This type of environment may come about when
lava flows from a volcano and hardens into rock.
a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock.
a landslide uncovers an area of bare rock.
The first species to colonize a disturbed area such as this are called pioneer species (see Figure below ).
They change the environment and pave the way for other species to come into the area.
Pioneer species are likely to include bacteria and lichens that can live on bare rock.
Along with wind and water, they help weather the rock and form soil.
Once soil begins to form, plants can move in.
At first, the plants include grasses and other species that can grow in thin, poor soil.
As more plants grow and die, organic matter is added to the soil.
This improves the soil and helps it hold water.
The improved soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area.
