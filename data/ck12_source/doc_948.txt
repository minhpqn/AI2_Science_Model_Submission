The breakup of a larger nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei is called fission.
fusion:
The joining together of two or more smaller nuclei to form a larger one is called fusion.
half-life:
The time required for half of the atoms in any given quantity of a radioactive substance to decay is the half-life of that element.
Describe the quark content of the proton and neutron.
Describe the additional quarks in the quark model.
Diagram illustrating quarks
The first suggestion of the existence of quarks was presented in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig.
They suggested that protons and neutrons were composed of three quarks called up (u), down (d), and strange (s).
A fourth quark was hypothesized just for reasons of symmetry and the name “charm” was suggested for the fourth quark by Sheldon Glashow and James Bkorken.
The first evidence for quarks was produced by an experiment in the Stanford Linear Accelerator by James Bkorken and Richard Feynman in 1968.
In 1974, Burton Richter and Samuel Ting, separately, announce on the same day that they discovered the same new particle.
Ting and his collaborators at Brookhaven called this particle the “J” particle, whereas Richter and his collaborators at SLAC called this particle the psi particle.
Since the discoveries are given equal weight, the particle is commonly known as the J/psi particle.
The J/psi particle is a charm-anti-charm meson.
After eighteen years of searching at many accelerators, experiments at Fermilab in 1995 discovered the top quark.
When the atomic theory was first suggested, the atoms were considered to be indivisible.
Sometime later, it was determined that, in fact, atoms were not indivisible but had component parts, namely protons, neutrons, and electrons.
At the time those particles were hypothesized, they were considered to be indivisible, having no smaller parts.
