Glaciers come off of ice caps into valleys.

Glaciers are not static; they grow, they move and they shrink.
Currently, most glaciers are shrinking.
Glaciers grow when snowfall exceeds melting.
Snow falls higher on the glacier.
Over time, the snow converts to granular ice known as firn.
As more snow and ice collect, the firn becomes denser.
This is now glacial ice.
Glaciers form only on land because water is too warm.
When a glacier flows into water, it usually breaks up into icebergs.
Those icebergs eventually melt into the water.
How does an ice field become a glacier?
In other words, why does the ice move?
Whether an ice field moves depends on the amount of ice.
It also depends on the steepness of the slope and the roughness of the ground surface.
Ice moves where the pressure is so great that the ice needs to move away.
Ice also slides at the bottom.
Often the ground is lubricated by water that melted from the glacier above.
