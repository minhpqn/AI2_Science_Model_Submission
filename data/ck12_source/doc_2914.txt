The answer is yes, two different genotypes can result in the same phenotype.
Remember, the recessive phenotype will be expressed only when the dominant allele is absent, or when an individual is homozygous recessive (tt) ( Figure below ).
Different genotypes will lead to different phenotypes of an organism
Different genotypes ( AA , Aa , aa or TT , Tt , tt ) will lead to different phenotypes, or different appearances of the organism.
Mendel's hereditary "factors" are variants of genes called alleles.
Genotype describes the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene, while phenotype describes the traits that you can see.
