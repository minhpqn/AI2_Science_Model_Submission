How Enzymes Work
How do enzymes speed up biochemical reactions so dramatically?
Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions.
This is illustrated in Figure below .
The biochemical reaction shown in the figure requires about three times as much activation energy without the enzyme as it does with the enzyme.

The reaction represented by this graph is a combustion reaction involving the reactants glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and oxygen (O 2 ).
The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O).
Energy is also released during the reaction.
The enzyme speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to start.
Compare the activation energy with and without the enzyme.
Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react.
For example:
Enzymes bring reactants together so they donâ€™t have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random.
Enzymes bind both reactant molecules (called substrates ), tightly and specifically, at a site on the enzyme molecule called the active site ( Figure below ).
This forms an enzyme-substrate complex.
By binding reactants at the active site, enzymes also position reactants correctly, so they do not have to overcome intermolecular forces that would otherwise push them apart.
This allows the molecules to interact with less energy.
