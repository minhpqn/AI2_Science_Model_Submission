You can see how Mendeleev organized the elements in the Figure below .
From left to right across each row, elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass.
Mendeleev discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and then continued on to the next row, the columns of the table would contain elements with similar properties.
He called the columns groups .
They are sometimes called families, because elements within a group are similar but not identical to one another, like people in a family.
Mendeleev's first periodic table
Mendeleev’s table of the elements is called a periodic table because of its repeating pattern.
Anything that keeps repeating is referred to as periodic.
Other examples of things that are periodic include the monthly phases of the moon and the daily cycle of night and day.
The term period refers to the interval between repetitions.
For example, the moon’s phases repeat every four weeks.
In a periodic table of the elements, the periods are the rows of the table.
In Mendeleev’s table, each period contains eight elements, and then the pattern repeats in the next row.
Filling in the Blanks
Did you notice the blanks in Mendeleev’s table?
They are spaces that Mendeleev left blank for elements that had not yet been discovered when he created his table.
He predicted that these missing elements would eventually be discovered.
Based on their position in the table, he even predicted their properties.
For example, he predicted a missing element in row 5 of group III.
He also predicted that the missing element would have an atomic mass of 68 and be a relatively soft metal like other elements in this group.
