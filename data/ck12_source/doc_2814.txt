The man in this old illustration was an alchemist.
Alchemists, who lived during the Middle Ages, were people who strived to turn lead into gold.
They tried all sorts of chemical reactions involving lead, but they were never able to produce gold.
Today, scientists know that one element cannot be changed into another by chemical processes.
However, there is a way that some elements can change into others.
You’ll find out what it is when you read this article.
