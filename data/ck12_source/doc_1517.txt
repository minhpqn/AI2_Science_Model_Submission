The Atmosphere and Weathering
Weather makes life interesting.
Weather also causes weathering.
Weathering is the slow wearing down of rocks on Earthâ€™s surface.
Wind-blown sand scours rocks like sandpaper.
Glaciers of ice scrape across rock surfaces like a file.
Even gentle rain may seep into rocks and slowly dissolve them.
If the water freezes, it expands.
This eventually causes the rocks to crack.
Without the atmosphere, none of this weathering would happen.
Rocks at the surface would be pristine and unaltered.
The Atmosphere and Sound
Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves.
Sound waves cannot travel through empty space, but they can travel through gases.
Gases in the air allow us to hear most of the sounds in our world.
Because of air, you can hear birds singing, horns tooting, and friends laughing.
Without the atmosphere, the world would be a silent, eerie place.
The atmosphere is made of gases that are essential for photosynthesis and other life activities.
The atmosphere is a crucial part of the water cycle.
It is an important reservoir for water, and the source of precipitation.
