The mean is (60 cm + 58 cm + 54 cm + 62 cm + 58 cm) ÷ 5 = 58 cm.
The median and mode are both 58 cm as well.
The mean, median, and mode are not always the same, as they are for this sample.
In fact, sometimes these three statistics are very different from one another for the same sample.
Describing the Range
Many samples have a lot of variation in measurements.
Variation can be described with a statistic called the range.
The range is the total spread of values in a sample.
It is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.
Q:
What is the range of heights in the sample of children in the previous question?
A:
The range is 62 cm – 54 cm = 8 cm.
Descriptive statistics are measures that summarize the characteristics of a sample.
The central tendency, or center, of a sample can be represented by the mean, median, or mode.
The variation in a sample can be represented by the range, or the total spread of values.
