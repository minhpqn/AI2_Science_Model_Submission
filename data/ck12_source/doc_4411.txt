When the diaphragm contracts, it increases the volume of the chest.
This decreases pressure on the lungs and allows air to flow in.
When the diaphragm relaxes, it decreases the volume of the chest.
This increases pressure on the lungs and forces air out.
The four-chambered mammalian heart can pump blood in two different directions.
The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen.
The left side of the heart pumps blood containing oxygen to the rest of the body.
Because of the dual pumping action of the heart, all of the blood going to body cells is rich in oxygen.
The Mammalian Brain
Of all vertebrates, mammals have the biggest and most complex brain for their body size (see Figure below ).
The front part of the brain, called the cerebrum , is especially large in mammals.
This part of the brain controls functions such as memory and learning.
Vertebrate brain comparison
Vertebrate Brains.
Vertebrate brains come in a range of sizes.
Even the brains of mammals show a lot of variation in size.
The area of the neocortex is greatest in humans.
The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum.
This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ).
The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions.
