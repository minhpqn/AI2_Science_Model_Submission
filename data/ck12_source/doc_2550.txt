Electrons can jump from a lower to the next higher energy level if they absorb this amount of energy.
Conversely, if electrons jump from a higher to a lower energy level, they give off energy, often in the form of light.
This explains the fireworks pictured above.
When the fireworks explode, electrons gain energy and jump to higher energy levels.
When they jump back to their original energy levels, they release the energy as light.
Different atoms have different arrangements of electrons, so they give off light of different colors.
You can see an animation of electrons jumping from one energy level to another at this URL:
Energy levels in an atom
Q:
In the atomic model Figure above , where would you find electrons that have the most energy?
A:
Electrons with the most energy would be found in energy level IV.
Energy Levels and Orbitals
The smallest atoms are hydrogen atoms.
They have just one electron orbiting the nucleus.
That one electron is in the first energy level.
Bigger atoms have more electrons.
Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible.
Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on.
How many electrons can a given energy level hold?
