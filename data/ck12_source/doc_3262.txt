A:
Light-colored clothes absorb less light and reflect more light than dark-colored clothes, so they keep people cooler.
Classifying Matter in Terms of Light
Matter can be classified on the basis of its interactions with light.
Matter may be transparent, translucent, or opaque.
An example of each type of matter is pictured in the Figure below .
Transparent matter is matter that transmits light without scattering it.
Examples of transparent matter include air, pure water, and clear glass.
You can see clearly through transparent objects, such as the top panes of the window below , because just about all of the light that strikes them passes through to the other side.
Light passes through transparent objects
Translucent matter is matter that transmits light but scatters the light as it passes through.
Light passes through translucent objects but you cannot see clearly through them because the light is scattered in all directions.
The frosted glass panes at the bottom of the window above are translucent.
Opaque matter is matter that does not let any light pass through it.
Matter may be opaque because it absorbs light, reflects light, or does some combination of both.
Examples of opaque objects are objects made of wood, like the shutters in the Figure below .
The shutters absorb most of the light that strikes them and reflect just a few wavelengths of visible light.
The glass mirror below is also opaque.
Thatâ€™s because it reflects all of the light that strikes it.
Reflection of light occurs when light bounces back from a surface that it cannot pass through.
