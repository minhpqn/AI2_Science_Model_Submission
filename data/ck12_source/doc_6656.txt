It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from predators.
Caring for offspring increases their chances of surviving.
Birds called killdeers have an interesting way of protecting their chicks.
When a predator gets too close to her nest, a mother killdeer pretends to have a broken wing.
The mother walks away from the nest holding her wing as though it were injured ( Figure below ).
The predator thinks she is injured and will be easy prey.
The mother leads the predator away from the nest and then flies away.
This mother killdeer is pretending she has a broken wing in order to protect her chicks
This mother killdeer is pretending she has a broken wing.
She is trying to attract a predatorâ€™s attention in order to protect her chicks.
This behavior puts her at risk of harm.
How can it increase her fitness?
In most species of mammals, parents also teach their offspring important skills.
For example, meerkat parents teach their pups how to eat scorpions without being stung.
A scorpion sting can be deadly, so this is a very important skill.
Teaching the young important skills makes it more likely that they will survive.
Notice that, compared to other types of animals, birds and mammals have relatively few offspring.
Some species of animals are territorial .
This means that they defend their area.
The area they defend usually contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring.
