This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere.
Air moves because of differences in heating.
These differences create convection currents and winds ( Figure below ).
Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground.
The warm air rises because it is light.
The light, rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface.
The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere.
The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface.
The sinking, heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground.
Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.
Air flowing over Earthâ€™s surface is called wind .
The greater the difference in pressure, the stronger the wind blows.

Differences in air temperature cause convection currents and wind.
Warm air rises because it is less dense.
This creates an area of low pressure.
Cool air sinks because it is denser.
This creates an area of high pressure.
Wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.
