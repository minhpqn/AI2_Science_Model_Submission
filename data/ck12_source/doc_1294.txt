What is stress?
What are the three directions in which stress can be applied?
What does tension cause in a rock mass?
What are the three styles of deformation?
If you had to a apply a certain amount of stress to a region and didn't want the rock to break, how could you do it?
What type of stress would you find at a transform fault?
What type of stress would you find at a subduction zone?
Under what conditions will a rock fracture?
Principle of Horizontality
Identify rules for the formation and deformation of sedimentary rock.
Explain how sedimentary rock helps scientists study geological history.
What is the pattern of the Grand Canyon rock layers?
If you go to the Grand Canyon, you'll see layers of sedimentary rocks.
These rocks are extremely well exposed for viewing.
Some people call this "layer cake geology." It looks like a layer cake, but not as tasty.
Just like a cake, the bottom layer is put down first.
Subsequent layers are deposited next.
Where the layers are not horizontal, there was deformation.
Sedimentary Rock Rules
Sedimentary rocks follow certain rules.
