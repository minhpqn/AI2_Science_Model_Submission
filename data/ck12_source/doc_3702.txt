Legal or illegal?
The completion of The Human Genome Project is one of the most important scientific events of the past 50 years.
However, is knowing all of our DNA a good thing?
The advancement of biotechnology has raised many interesting ethical, legal and social questions.
Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues
Imagine someone analyzes part of your DNA.
Who controls that information?
What if your health insurance company found out you were predisposed to develop a devastating genetic disease.
Might they decide to cancel your insurance?
Privacy issues concerning genetic information is an important issue in this day and age.
ELSI stands for Ethical, Legal and Social Issues.
It's a term associated with the Human Genome project.
This project didn't only have the goal to identify all the genes in the human genome, but also to address the ELSI that might arise from the project.
Rapid advances in DNA-based research, human genetics, and their applications have resulted in new and complex ethical and legal issues for society.
