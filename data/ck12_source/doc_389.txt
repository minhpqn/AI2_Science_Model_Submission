Your back teeth are broad and flat.
They grind food into smaller pieces when you chew.
Chewing is part of mechanical digestion.
Your tongue pushes the food to the back of your mouth so you can swallow it.
When you swallow, the lump of chewed food passes down your throat to your esophagus.
The esophagus is a narrow tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.
Food moves through the esophagus because of peristalsis.
At the lower end of the esophagus, a circular muscle controls the opening to the stomach.
The muscle relaxes to let food pass into the stomach.
Then the muscle contracts again to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus.
Some people think that gravity moves food through the esophagus.
If that were true, food would move through the esophagus only when you are sitting or standing upright.
In fact, because of peristalsis, food can move through the esophagus no matter what position you are in—even upside down!
Just don’t try to swallow food when you are upside down—you could choke!
The stomach is a sac-like organ at the end of the esophagus.
It has thick muscular walls.
The muscles contract and relax.
This moves the food around and helps break it into smaller pieces.
Mixing the food around with the enzyme pepsin and other chemicals helps digest proteins.
Water, salt, and simple sugars can be absorbed into the blood from the stomach.
