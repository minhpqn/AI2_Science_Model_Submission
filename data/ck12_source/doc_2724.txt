Try this yourself and see if you can taste the reaction.
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction.
A catalyst provides an alternate pathway for the reaction that has a lower activation energy.
When activation energy is lower, more reactant particles have enough energy to react, so the reaction occurs faster.
Chemical reactions constantly occur inside living things, and many of them require catalysts to occur quickly enough to support life.
Catalysts in living things are called enzymes.
At the following URL, watch the video showing a chemical reaction both with and without a catalyst.
Then answer the questions below.

Write the chemical equation for the reaction that is demonstrated in the video.
What chemical is used to catalyze the reaction?
Describe two observations that provide evidence that the reaction has occurred after the addition of the catalyst.
What is a catalyst?
How does a catalyst speed up a chemical reaction?
What are enzymes?
Why are they important?
Explain why carbon is found in most compounds.
Describe how carbon forms bonds.
Spiral structures like the one pictured here could replace batteries in the future because they can store energy like a spring and conduct electricity.
The structure is a tiny nanotube that consists entirely of carbon atoms.
