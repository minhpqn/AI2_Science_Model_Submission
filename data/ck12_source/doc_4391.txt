Birds have a sac-like structure called a crop to store and moisten food that is waiting to be digested.
They also have an organ called a gizzard that contains swallowed stones.
The stones make up for the lack of teeth by grinding food, which can then be digested more quickly.
Both structures make it easier for the digestive system to produce a steady supply of nutrients from food.

The intricate passageways in a bird’s lung are adapted for efficient gas exchange.

Nervous System and Sense Organs
Birds have a large brain relative to the size of their body.
Not surprisingly, the part of the brain that controls flight is the most developed part.
The large brain size of birds is also reflected by their high level of intelligence and complex behavior.
In fact, birds such as crows and ravens may be more intelligent than many mammals.
They are smart enough to use objects such as twigs for tools.
They also demonstrate planning and cooperation.
Most birds have a poor sense of smell, but they make up for it with their excellent sense of sight.
Predatory birds have especially good eyesight.
