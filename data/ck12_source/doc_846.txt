Examples of decomposers include mushrooms on a decaying log.
Bacteria in the soil are also decomposers.
Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers.
Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up and the nutrients within the waste and dead organisms would not be released back into the ecosystem.
Producers would not have enough nutrients.
The carbon and nitrogen necessary to build organic compounds, and then cells, allowing an organism to grow, would be insufficient.
Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would also not be sufficient.
Essentially, many organisms could not exist.
