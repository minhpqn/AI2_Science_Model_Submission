Absorb what?
Imagine the inside walls of the 23 feet of your small intestine covered with these finger-like projections.
Why?
What's their purpose, and why is the small intestine so long?
These projections absorb.
Absorb what?
Minerals and nutrients from food.
And the length of the small intestine allows as much of these important substances to be absorbed as possible.
Digestion and Absorption:
The Small Intestine
The small intestine is a narrow tube about 7 meters (23 feet) long in adults.
It is the site of most chemical digestion and virtually all absorption.
The small intestine consists of three parts: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum (see the opening figure).
Digestion in the Small Intestine
The duodenum is the first and shortest part of the small intestine.
Most chemical digestion takes place here, and many digestive enzymes are active in the duodenum (see Table below ).
Some are produced by the duodenum itself.
Others are produced by the pancreas and secreted into the duodenum.
