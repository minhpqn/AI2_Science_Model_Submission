Most bryophytes are small.
They not only lack vascular tissues; they also lack true leaves, seeds, and flowers.
Instead of roots, they have hair-like rhizoids to anchor them to the ground and to absorb water and minerals (see Figure below ).
Bryophytes occupy niches in moist habitats, but, as they lack vascular tissue, they are not very efficient at absorbing water.
Rhizoids on a bryophyte
The rhizoids of a bryophyte may be so fine that they are just one cell thick.
Bryophytes also depend on moisture to reproduce.
Sperm produced by a male gametophyte must swim through a layer of rainwater or dew to reach an egg produced by a female gametophyte.
The tiny, diploid sporophyte generation then undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores.
The spores may also need moisture to disperse.
Evolution of Nonvascular Plants
Nonvascular plants were the first plants to evolve.
Compared to other plants, their small size and lack of specialized structures, such as vascular tissue, stems, leaves, or flowers, explains why these plants evolved first.
The first nonvascular plants to evolve were the liverworts.
The hornworts evolved somewhat later, and mosses apparently evolved last.
Of all the bryophytes, mosses are most similar to vascular plants.
Presumably, they share the most recent common ancestor with vascular plants.
Diversity of Nonvascular Plants
The three types of modern nonvascular plants are pictured in Figure below .
Liverworts are tiny nonvascular plants that have leaf-like, lobed, or ribbon-like photosynthetic tissues rather than leaves.
