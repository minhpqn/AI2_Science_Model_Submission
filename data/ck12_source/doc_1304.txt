Compare and contrast normal and reverse faults.
Imagine you're looking at a cliff with layers of rock.
What features would you see to indicate a fault?
What is a strike-slip fault?
What type of plate boundary can be a strike-slip fault or fault zone?
Explain how converging or diverging plates can create mountain ranges.
How do plate motions create mountains?
Plate tectonic processes create some of the world's most beautiful places.
The North Cascades Mountains in Washington State are a continental volcanic arc.
The mountains currently host some glaciers.
There are many features left by the more abundant ice age glaciers.
Changes in altitude make the range a habitable place for many living organisms.
Stress and Mountain Building
Many processes create mountains.
Most mountains form along plate boundaries.
A few mountains may form in the middle of a plate.
For example, hotspot volcanoes.
Most of the worldâ€™s largest mountains form as plates collide at convergent plate boundaries.
Continental crust is too buoyant to get pushed down into the mantle.
So when the plates smash together, the crust crumples upward.
