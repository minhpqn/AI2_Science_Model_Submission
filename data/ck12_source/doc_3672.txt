Distinguish codominance from incomplete dominance.
Explain an example of multiple allele traits.
Summarize the phenotypic distribution in polygenic characteristics.
Green, blue, brown, black, hazel, violet, or grey.
What color are your eyes?
Of course human eyes do not come in multi-color, but they do come in many colors.
How do eyes come in so many colors?
That brings us to complex inheritance patterns, known as non-Mendelian inheritance.
Many times inheritance is more complicated than the simple patterns observed by Mendel.
The inheritance of characteristics is not always as simple as it is for the characteristics that Mendel studied in pea plants.
Each characteristic Mendel investigated was controlled by one gene that had two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant to the other.
This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each characteristic.
Each characteristic Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a different (nonhomologous) chromosome.
As a result, each characteristic was inherited independently of the other characteristics.
Geneticists now know that inheritance is often more complex than this.
A characteristic may be controlled by one gene with two alleles, but the two alleles may have a different relationship than the simple dominant-recessive relationship that you have read about so far.
For example, the two alleles may have a codominant or incompletely dominant relationship.
The former is illustrated by the flower in Figure below , and the latter in Figure below .
Codominance occurs when both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype of the heterozygote.
The red and white flower in the figure has codominant alleles for red petals and white petals.
