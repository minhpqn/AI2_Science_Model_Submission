Evolution of Seed Plants
The earliest seed plants probably evolved close to 300 million years ago.
They were similar to modern ginkgoes and reproduced with pollen and seeds in cones.
Early seed plants quickly came to dominate forests during the Mesozoic Era, or Age of the Dinosaurs, about 250 to 65 million years ago.
As seed plants continued to evolve, Earth’s overall climate became drier, so early seed plants evolved adaptations to help them live with low levels of water.
Some also evolved adaptations to cold.
They had woody trunks and needle-like, evergreen leaves covered with a thick coating of waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.
Some of the trees were huge, like today’s giant sequoia, a modern conifer (see Figure below
Enormous giant sequoia
The person standing at the foot of this giant sequoia show just how enormous the tree is.
Some early seed plants also grew very large.
Eventually, some gymnosperms started to evolve angiosperm-like traits.
For example, cycad ancestors were the first plants to use insects as pollinators.
They also used birds and monkeys to disperse their brightly colored seeds.
Of modern gymnosperms, Gnetae probably share the most recent common ancestor with angiosperms.
Among other similarities, Gnetae produce nectar , a sweet, sugary liquid that attracts insect pollinators.
Most modern flowering plants also produce nectar.
Most vascular plants are seed plants, or spermatophytes.
They reproduce with seeds and pollen.
Some modern seed plants are gymnosperms that produce seeds in cones.
