Did you ever eat something that didn’t “agree” with you?
Maybe you had a stomachache or felt sick to your stomach?
Maybe you had diarrhea?
These could be symptoms of foodborne illness, food allergies, or a food intolerance.
Harmful bacteria can enter your digestive system in food and make you sick.
This is called foodborne illness or food poisoning.
The bacteria, or the toxins they produce, may cause vomiting or cramping, in addition to the symptoms mentioned above.
Foodborne illnesses can also be caused by viruses and parasites.
The most common foodborne illnesses happen within a few minutes to a few hours, and make you feel really sick, but last for only about a day or so.
Others can take longer for the illness to appear.
Some people believe that the taste of food will tell you if it is bad.
As a rule, you probably should not eat bad tasting food, but many contaminated foods can still taste good.
You can help prevent foodborne illness by following a few simple rules.
Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold.
This helps prevent any bacteria in the foods from multiplying.
Wash your hands before you prepare or eat food.
This helps prevent bacteria on your hands from getting on the food.
This is the easiest way to prevent foodborne illnesses.
Wash your hands after you touch raw foods, such as meats, poultry, fish, or eggs.
These foods often contain bacteria that your hands could transfer to your mouth.
