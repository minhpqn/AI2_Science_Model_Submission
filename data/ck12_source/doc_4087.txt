Why are organisms similar?
Why are there so many different types of organisms?
To answer his questions, he developed what we now call "the theory of evolution by natural selection." This theory is one of the most important theories in the field of life science.
In everyday English, "evolution" simply means "change." In biology, evolution states that all living organisms came from earlier forms of life.
The theory of evolution by natural selection explains why evolution occurs.
Darwin spent over 20 years traveling around the world and making observations before he fully developed his theory.

Voyage of the HMS Beagle
In 1859, Charles Darwin published his book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (often known as  The Origin of Species ).
His book describes the observations and evidence that he collected more than 20 years of research, beginning with a five-year voyage around the world on a British research ship, the HMS Beagle .
During the voyage ( Figure below ), Darwin made observations about plants and animals around the world.
He also collected specimens to study for when he returned to England.
Each time the HMS Beagle stopped at a port, Darwin went on land to explore and look at the local plants, animals, and fossils.
One of the most important things Darwin did was keep a diary.
He took detailed notes and made drawings of his observations.
