We will discuss each of these stresses separately.
The change to the equilibrium position in every case is either a favoring of the forward reaction or a favoring of the reverse reaction.
When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of products increases, while the concentrations of reactants decreases.
When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of products decreases, while the concentrations of reactants increases.
A \rightleftarrows B
forward:
A \rightarrow B
[A] decreases; [B] increases
A \rightleftarrows B
reverse:
A \leftarrow B
[A] increases; [B] decreases
Henri LeChatelier postulated that a chemical system moves to release stress from the system
Henri Le Châtelier
Le Châtelier’s principle describes how a reaction system at equilibrium is influenced by stress.
