What is this blue ball?
Uranus is so far away that there has been relatively little exploration of the planet.
The closest approach was a flyby by Voyager 2 in 1986.
Great images have also been taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Uranus is named for the Greek god of the sky, the father of Saturn.
Astronomers pronounce the name “YOOR-uh-nuhs.” Uranus was not known to ancient observers.
The planet was first discovered with a telescope by the astronomer William Herschel in 1781.
