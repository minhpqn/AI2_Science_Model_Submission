The genetic information on the plasmids is transferable between cells, allowing prokaryotes to share abilities, such as antibiotic resistance.
Scientists have discovered that plasmids serve as important tools in genetics and biotechnology labs, most commonly for their ability to amplify (make many copies of) or to express particular genes.
For example, the pGLO plasmid is a genetically engineered plasmid used in biotechnology as a vector for creating genetically modified organisms.
Below is a video that will demonstrate the pGLO transformation.

Reproduction in prokaryotic cells is by binary fission ; a process of growth, enlargement and division.
This will be discussed in the Cell Division:
Prokaryotic (Advanced) concept.
Prokaryotes have a large array of characteristics, that enable them to withstand different conditions, environments and resources.
Some live in the absence of oxygen, some in extreme cold or hot temperatures, and some in the bottom of the ocean where their only resource is hot hydrogen sulfide, bubbling up from the core of the Earth.
They are spectacularly resourceful organisms.
A eukaryotic cell, represented here by a model animal cell is much more complex than a prokaryotic cell.
Eukaryotic cells contain many organelles that do specific jobs.
No single eukaryotic cell has all the organelles shown here, and this model shows all eukaryotic organelles.
A eukaryote is an organism whose cells are organized into complex structures by internal membranes and a cytoskeleton, as shown in Figure above .
The most characteristic membrane-bound structure of eukaryotes is the nucleus.
This feature gives them their name, which comes from Greek and means "true nucleus." The nucleus is the membrane-enclosed organelle that contains DNA.
Eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called chromosomes .
Some eukaryotes are single-celled, but many are multicellular.
