Acetic acid is stronger than carbonic acid, and so on.
The Acid Ionization Constant, K_a
The ionization for a general weak acid, HA, can be written as follows:
\text{HA}(aq) \rightarrow \text{H}^+ (aq) + \text{A}^-(aq)
Because the acid is weak, an equilibrium expression can be written.
An acid ionization constant  (K_a) is the equilibrium constant for the ionization of an acid.
The acid ionization represents the fraction of the original acid that has been ionized in solution.
Therefore, the numerical value of  K_a is a reflection of the strength of the acid.
Weak acids with relatively higher  K_a values are stronger than acids with relatively lower  K_a values.
Because strong acids are essentially 100% ionized, the concentration of the acid in the denominator is nearly zero and the  K_a value approaches infinity.
For this reason,  K_a values are generally reported for weak acids only.
The Table below is a listing of acid ionization constants for several acids.
Note that polyprotic acids have a distinct ionization constant for each ionization step, with each successive ionization constant being smaller than the previous one.
