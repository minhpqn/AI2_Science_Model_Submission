Calculation of pH is simple when there is a 1 × 10 power problem.
However, in real life that is rarely the situation.
If the coefficient is not equal to 1, a calculator must be used to find the pH.
For example, the pH of a solution with [H + ] = 2.3 × 10 -5  M  can be found as shown below.
pH = -log[2.3 × 10 -5 ] = 4.64
When the pH of a solution is known, the concentration of the hydrogen ion can be calculated.
The inverse of the logarithm (or antilog) is the 10 x key on a calculator.
[H + ] = 10 -pH
For example, suppose that you have a solution with a pH of 9.14.
To find the [H + ] use the 10 x key.
[H + ] = 10 -pH = 10 -9.14 = 7.24 × 10 -10 M
Hydroxide Ion Concentration and pH
As we saw earlier, the hydroxide ion concentration of any aqueous solution is related to the hydrogen ion concentration through the value of K_w .
We can use that relationship to calculate the pH of a solution of a base.
Sample Problem:
The pH of a Base
Sodium hydroxide is a strong base.
Find the pH of a solution prepared by dissolving 1.0 g of NaOH into enough water to make 1.0 L of solution.
Step 1:
List the known values and plan the problem .
