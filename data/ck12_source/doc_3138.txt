The temperature of the air near the ground can be as high as 57 °C (134 °F)—and that’s in the shade (if you can find any)!
The temperature of the sand in the baking sun can be much higher.
If you were to walk barefoot on the hot sand, it would burn your feet.
The air and sand in Death Valley have a lot of thermal energy.
What Is Thermal Energy?
Why do the air and sand of Death Valley feel so hot?
It’s because their particles are moving very rapidly.
Anything that is moving has kinetic energy, and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has.
The total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter is called thermal energy .
It’s not just hot things such as the air and sand of Death Valley that have thermal energy.
All matter has thermal energy, even matter that feels cold.
That’s because the particles of all matter are in constant motion and have kinetic energy.
Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Mass
Thermal energy and temperature are closely related.
Both reflect the kinetic energy of moving particles of matter.
However, temperature is the average kinetic energy of particles of matter, whereas thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of particles of matter.
Does this mean that matter with a lower temperature has less thermal energy than matter with a higher temperature?
Not necessarily.
Another factor also affects thermal energy.
The other factor is mass.
