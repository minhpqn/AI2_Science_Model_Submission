Early continents were small and mantle convection was fast.
When did Earth become a dynamic planet?
Earth was always dynamic!
Earth has changed many times over billions of years.
Huge mountains have formed, been destroyed, and been replaced with new mountains.
Continents have moved, split apart, and collided with each other.
Ocean basins have opened up.
Life on Earth evolved slowly for billions of years.
The earliest crust was probably basalt.
It may have resembled the current seafloor.
This crust formed before there were any oceans.
More than four billion years ago, continental crust appeared.
The first continents were very small compared with those today.
Continents grow when microcontinents , or small continents, collide with each other or with a larger continent.
Oceanic island arcs also collide with continents to make them grow.
The earliest continental crust is now found in the ancient cores of continents, called the cratons .
Geologists can learn many things about the Precambrian by studying the rocks of the cratons.
Cratons contain felsic igneous rocks, which are remnants of the first continents.
Cratonic rocks contain rounded sedimentary grains.
Rounded grains indicate that the minerals eroded from an earlier rock.
