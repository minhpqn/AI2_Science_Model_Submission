One joule is the amount of energy needed to apply a force of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter.
Runners have kinetic energy
What about Juan’s dad?
His mass 80 kg, and he’s running at the same velocity as Juan (1 m/s).
Because his mass is twice as great as Juan’s, his kinetic energy is twice as great:
\text{KE}=\frac{1}{2} \times 80 \ \text{kg} \times (1 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}})^2=40 \ \text{kg} \times \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}=40 \ \text{N} \cdot \text{m} , or 40 \ \text{J}
Q:
What is Juan’s kinetic energy if he speeds up to 2 m/s from 1 m/s?
A:
By doubling his velocity, Juan increases his kinetic energy by a factor of four:
\text{KE}=\frac{1}{2} \times 40 \ \text{kg} \times (2 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}})^2=80 \ \text{kg} \times \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}=80 \ \text{N} \cdot \text{m} , or 80 \ \text{J}
Review how kinetic energy is related to mass and velocity by watching this cartoon:
Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of moving matter.
Anything that is moving has kinetic energy.
The amount of kinetic energy in a moving object depends directly on its mass and velocity.
It can be calculated with the equation: \text{KE}=\frac{1}{2}\text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2 .
