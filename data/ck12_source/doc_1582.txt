The Clean Air Act
Air quality is a measure of the pollutants in the air.
More pollutants mean poorer air quality.
Poor air quality started to become a serious problem after the Industrial Revolution.
Factories burned coal for energy.
Gasoline burned by cars and trucks added greatly to air pollution.
By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very bad.
Incidents in London and in U.S. cities alerted people to the extent of the problem.
It was clear that air quality needed to be protected.
In 1970 in the U.S., the Clean Air Act was passed.
It limits what can be released into the air.
The air in the U.S. is much cleaner now than it was 50 years ago.
But air pollution has not gone away.
Vehicles, factories, and power plants still release more than 150 million tons of pollutants into the air each year.
Reducing Pollutants from Fossil Fuels
There are two basic types of strategies for reducing pollution from fossil fuels:
Use less fossil fuel.
Prevent pollutants from entering the air.
Use Less Fossil Fuel
We can reduce our use of fossil fuels in several ways:
