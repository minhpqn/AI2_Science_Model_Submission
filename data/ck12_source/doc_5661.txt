nuclear model :
The nuclear model of the atom consists of a small and dense positively charged interior surrounded by a cloud of electrons.
Identify the nucleus of the atom.
Describe the size and mass of the nucleus.
Explain what holds the nucleus together.
An atomic bomb explodes and generates a huge mushroom cloud.
The tremendous energy released when the bomb explodes is incredibly destructive.
Where does all the energy come from?
The answer is the nucleus of the atom.
At the Heart of It All
The nucleus (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the center of the atom.
It consists of two types of subatomic particles packed tightly together.
The particles are protons, which have a positive electric charge, and neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge.
Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with orbiting negative particles called electrons whizzing through it.
The Figure below shows these parts of the atom.

Size and Mass of the Nucleus
The nucleus of the atom is extremely small.
Its radius is only about 1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom.
If an atom were the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a pea!
