Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube.
The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings.
Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers.
The most commonly used temperature scale in the United States is the Farenheit scale.
However, this scale is rarely used throughout the world; the metric temperature scale is Celsius.
This scale, based on the properties of water, was devised by the Swedish physicist, Anders Celsius (1704 – 1744).
The freezing point of water is 0°C and the boiling point of water was assigned to be 100°C.
The kinetic energies between these two points was divided evenly into 100 “degrees Celsius”.
The Kelvin or “Absolute” temperature scale is the scale often used by chemists and physicists.
It is based on the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases; this temperature is called absolute zero and is 0 K.
This temperature corresponds to -273.15°C.
Since absolute zero is the coldest possible temperature, there are no negative values on the Kelvin temperature scale.
Conveniently, the Kelvin and Celsius scales have the same definition of a degree, which makes it very easy to convert from one scale to the other.
The relationship between Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales is given by:
K = °C + 273.15
On the Kelvin scale, water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K.
Example Problem:  Convert 25°C to Kelvin.
Solution:
K = °C + 273 = 25°C + 273 = 298 K
