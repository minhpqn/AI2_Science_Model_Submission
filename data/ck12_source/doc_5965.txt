What is occuring in this picture?
In the early days of chemistry, there were few tools for the detailed study of compounds.
Much of the information regarding the composition of compounds came from the elemental analysis of inorganic materials.
The “new” field of organic chemistry (the study of carbon compounds) faced the challenge of not being able to characterize a compound completely.
The relative amounts of elements could be determined, but so many of these materials had carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and possibly nitrogen in simple ratios.
We did not know exactly how many of these atoms were actually in a specific molecule.
Determining Empirical Formulas
An empirical formula is one that shows the lowest whole-number ratio of the elements in a compound.  Because the structure of ionic compounds is an extended three-dimensional network of positive and negative ions, all formulas of ionic compounds are empirical.
However, we can also consider the empirical formula of a molecular compound.  Ethene is a small hydrocarbon compound with the formula C 2 H 4 (see Figure below ).  While C 2 H 4 is its molecular formula and represents its true molecular structure, it has an empirical formula of CH 2 .  The simplest ratio of carbon to hydrogen in ethene is 1:2.
