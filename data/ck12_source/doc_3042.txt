Bernoulli’s law provides the answer.
Look at the wings of the plane and hawk in the Figure below .
The shape of the wings causes air to flow more slowly below them than above them.
This causes air pressure to be greater below the wings than above them.
The difference in air pressure lifts the plane or bird above the ground.
Airplanes and birds fly using Bernoulli's law
Q :
How does a spoiler on a racecar use Bernoulli’s law?
A :
A spoiler on a racecar is like an upside-down wing.
Its shape causes air to flow more slowly—and air pressure to be greater—above the spoiler than below it.
As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, helping it to stay on the track.
Bernoulli’s law states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as air is less when the fluid is moving faster.
Bernoulli’s law explains how wings of airplanes and birds create lift and allow them to fly.
