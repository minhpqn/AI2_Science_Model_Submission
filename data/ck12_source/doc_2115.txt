Crops need energy, fertilizer, and land to grow.
Sometimes the amount of resources that go into producing the crop is too high.
The crop produces very little energy more than it consumes.
Corn is a very inefficient source of biofuels.
Also, the fertilizers and pesticides used to grow the crops enter the environment.
They run off the crops and become damaging pollutants in nearby water bodies or in the oceans.
Scientists are looking for much better sources of biomass energy.
Research is being done into alternative crops for biofuels.
A very promising alternative is algae.
Algae appears to be a better biofuel than corn.
Algae is much easier to convert to a usable fuel.
Growing algae requires much less land and energy than crops.
Algae can be grown in locations that are not used for other things.
For example, they can be grown in desert areas where food crops are not often grown.
Corn must be grown where food crops are grown.
This can reduce the land and water available for growing food.
Algae can be fed agricultural and other waste, so valuable resources are not used.
Much research is being done to bring these alternative fuels to market.
