Therefore, the parent with purple flowers must have the genotype Bb .
Punnett Square for Two Characteristics
When you consider more than one characteristic at a time, using a Punnett square is more complicated.
This is because many more combinations of alleles are possible.
For example, with two genes each having two alleles, an individual has four alleles, and these four alleles can occur in 16 different combinations.
This is illustrated for pea plants in Figure below .
In this cross, known as a dihybrid cross , both parents are heterozygous for pod color ( Gg ) and pod form ( Ff ).
Punnett square for two characteristics
Punnett Square for Two Characteristics.
This Punnett square represents a cross between two pea plants that are heterozygous for two characteristics.
G represents the dominant allele for green pod color, and g represents the recessive allele for yellow pod color.
F represents the dominant allele for full pod form, and f represents the recessive allele for constricted pod form.
A Punnett square is a chart that allows you to determine the expected percentages of different genotypes in the offspring of two parents.
A Punnett square allows the prediction of the percentages of phenotypes in the offspring of a cross from known genotypes.
A Punnett square can be used to determine a missing genotype based on the other genotypes involved in a cross.
