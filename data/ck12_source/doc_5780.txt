Define “ionization energy.”
Do valence electrons have larger or smaller ionization energies that the inner-shell kernel electrons?
What is electron shielding?
Describe the trends in ionization energy from left to right across the periodic table.
Describe the trends in ionization energy from top to bottom of a group in the periodic table.
Why is the second ionization energy for lithium so much larger than the first ionization energy?
electron shielding:
As more electrons are added to a nucleus, the outer electrons become shielded from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons
ionization energy:
The energy required to remove an electron from a specific atom.
It is measured in kJ/mol, which is an energy unit, much like calories.
Define electron shielding.
Explain sublevel shielding.
A roller derby game is like electron shielding
What is the goal of a roller derby game?
Roller derby is a popular sport, although it is unfamiliar to many people.
The basic purpose is to set one team member (the “jammer”) past the opposing team to score points.
Other members of the team serve as blockers to prevent the opposing team from stopping the jammer.
Blockers interfere with the interaction between the jammer and the opponents by getting between the jammer and the skaters trying to stop her.
The attraction between an electron and the nucleus of the atom is not a simple issue.  Only with hydrogen is there a one-to-one relationship that can be discussed in terms of direct charge attraction.  As the size of the atom increases, the number of protons and electrons also increase.
