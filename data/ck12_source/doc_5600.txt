There are three major scales used today.
Scientific Dimensional Analysis
Define dimensional analysis.
Use dimensional analysis in solving problems.
Many quantities can be expressed in several different ways.
The English system measurement of 4 cups is also equal to 2 pints, 1 quart, and ¼ of a gallon.
4 cups = 2 pints = 1 quart = 0.25 gallon
Notice that the numerical component of each quantity is different, while the actual amount of material that it represents is the same.
That is because the units are different.
We can establish the same set of equalities for the metric system:
1 meter = 10 decimeters = 100 centimeters = 100 millimeters
The metric system’s use of powers of 10 for all conversions makes this quite simple.
Whenever two quantities are equal, a ratio can be written that is numerically equal to 1.
Using the metric examples above:
\frac{1 \ \text{m}}{100 \ \text{cm}}=\frac{100 \ \text{cm}}{100 \ \text{cm}}=\frac{1 \ \text{m}}{1 \ \text{m}}=1
The \frac{1 \ \text{m}}{100 \ \text{cm}} is called a conversion factor .
A conversion factor is a ratio of equivalent measurements.
Because both 1 m and 100 cm represent the exact same length, the value of the conversion factor is 1.
The conversion factor is read as “1 meter per 100 centimeters”.
Other conversion factors from the cup measurement example can be:
