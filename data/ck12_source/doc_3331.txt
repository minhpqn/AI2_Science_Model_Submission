One safety feature is the label on a lamp that warns the user of the maximum safe wattage for light bulbs.
Another safety feature is double insulation on many electric devices.
Not only are the electric wires insulated with a coating of plastic but so is the entire device.
The old toaster pictured in the Figure above lacks this safety feature, but most modern toasters have a plastic casing.
This reduces the risk of current leaving the device except through the cord.
Using Electricity Safely
Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it is misused.
Follow the safety rules below to reduce the risk of injury or fire from electricity.
Never mix electricity and water.
Don’t plug in or turn on electric lights or appliances when your hands are wet, you are standing in water, or you are in the shower or bathtub.
The current could flow through the water—and you—because water is a good conductor of electricity.
Never overload circuits.
Avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet or extension cord.
The more devices that are plugged in, the more current the circuit carries.
Too much current can overheat a circuit and start a fire.
Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs.
They can cause shocks, shorts, and fires.
Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets.
Putting any other object into an outlet is likely to cause a serious shock that could be fatal.
