HIV infects and destroys helper T cells .
As shown in Figure below , the virus injects its own DNA into a helper T cell and uses the T cell’s “machinery” to make copies of itself.
In the process the T cell is destroyed, and the virus copies go on to infect other helper T cells.

HIV mechanism for destroying T cells
This diagram shows how HIV infects and destroys T cells.
HIV is able to evade the immune system and keep destroying T cells.
This occurs in two ways:
The virus frequently mutates and changes its surface antigens .
This prevents antigen-specific lymphocytes from developing that could destroy cells infected with the virus.
The virus uses the plasma membranes of host cells to hide its own antigens.
This prevents the host’s immune system from detecting the antigens and destroying infected cells.
As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing.
The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection.
As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body.
As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections.
Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS.
There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.
