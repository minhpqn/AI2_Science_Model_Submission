It also means that rivers or seas existed.
One common rock type in the cratons is greenstone , a metamorphosed volcanic rock ( Figure below ).
Since greenstones are found today in oceanic trenches, what does the presence of greenstones mean?
These ancient greenstones indicate the presence of subduction zones.

Ice age glaciers scraped the Canadian Shield down to the 4.28 billion year old greenstone in Northwestern Quebec.
There are times in Earth history when all of the continents come together to form a supercontinent .
Supercontinents come together and then break apart.
Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth, but it was not the first.
The supercontinent before Pangaea is called Rodinia.
Rodinia contained about 75% of the continental landmass that is present today.
The supercontinent came together about 1.1 billion years ago.
Rodinia was not the first supercontinent either.
Scientists think that three supercontinents came before Rodina, making five so far in Earth history.
Early Plate Tectonics
Since the early Earth was very hot, mantle convection was very rapid.
Plate tectonics likely moved quickly.
The early Earth was an active place with abundant volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
The remnants of these early rocks are now seen in the ancient cores of the continents.
The first crust was basalt.
