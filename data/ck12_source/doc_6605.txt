What did he discover?
The first enzyme to be isolated was discovered in 1926 by American chemist James Sumner, who crystallized the protein.
The enzyme was urease, which catalyzes the hydrolytic decomposition of urea, a component of urine, into ammonia and carbon dioxide.
\text{H}_2\text{NCONH}_2 (aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O} (l) \xrightarrow{\text{urease}} 2\text{NH}_3 (g)+\text{CO}_2 (g)
His discovery was ridiculed at first because nobody believed that enzymes would behave the same way that other chemicals did.
Sumner was eventually proven right and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946.
An enzyme is a protein that acts as a biological catalyst.
Recall that a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being consumed in the reaction.
Cellular processes consist of many chemical reactions that must occur quickly in order for the cell to function properly.
Enzymes catalyze most of the chemical reactions that occur in a cell.
A substrate is the molecule or molecules on which the enzyme acts.
In the urease catalyzed reaction above, urea is the substrate.
The Figure below diagrams a typical enzymatic reaction.
Diagram of enzymatic action
The sequence of steps for a substrate binding to an enzyme in its active site, reacting, then being released as products.
The first step in the reaction is that the substrate binds to a specific part of the enzyme molecule.
The binding of the substrate is dictated by the shape of each molecule.
Side chains on the enzyme interact with the substrate in a specific way, resulting in the making and breaking of bonds.
The active site is the place on an enzyme where the substrate binds.
An enzyme folds in such a way that it typically has one active site, usually a pocket or crevice formed by the folding pattern of the protein.
