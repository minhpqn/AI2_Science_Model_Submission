This allows them to survive in arid environments.
Plants live just about everywhere on Earth.
To live in so many different habitats, they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions.
All plants are adapted to live on land.
Or are they?
All living plants today have terrestrial ancestors, but some plants now live in the water.
They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat.
Adaptations to Water
Aquatic plants are plants that live in water.
Living in water has certain advantages for plants.
One advantage is, well, the water.
There’s plenty of it and it’s all around.
Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water.
They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticles on leaves.
Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water.
As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants.
Living in water does present challenges to plants, however.
For one thing, pollination by wind or animals isn’t feasible under water, so aquatic plants may have adaptations that help them keep their flowers above water.
For instance, water lilies have bowl-shaped flowers and broad, flat leaves that float.
This allows the lilies to collect the maximum amount of sunlight, which does not penetrate very deeply below the water's surface.
