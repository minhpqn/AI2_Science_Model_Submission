Early North American camels migrated to other places.
Some went to East Asia.
They crossed a land bridge during the last ice age.
A few of them made it all the way to Africa.
Others went to South America.
They crossed the Isthmus of Panama.
Once camels reached these different places, they evolved independently.
They evolved adaptations that suited them for the particular environment where they lived.
Through natural selection, descendants of the original camel ancestors evolved the diversity they have today.
The biogeography of islands yields some of the best evidence for evolution.
Consider the birds called finches that Darwin studied on the Galápagos Islands (see Figure below ).
All of the finches probably descended from one bird that arrived on the islands from South America.
Until the first bird arrived, there had never been birds on the islands.
The first bird was a seed eater.
It evolved into many finch species.
Each species was adapted for a different type of food.
This is an example of adaptive radiation .
This is the process by which a single species evolves into many new species to fill available niches.
Galapagos finches' beak size and shape
Galápagos finches differ in beak size and shape, depending on the type of food they eat.
