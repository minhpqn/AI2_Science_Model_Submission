Even so, eruptions are very difficult to predict.
History of Volcanic Activities
Scientists study a volcano’s history to try to predict when it will next erupt.
They want to know how long it has been since it last erupted.
They also want to know the time span between its previous eruptions.
Scientists watch both active and dormant volcanoes closely for signs that show they might erupt.

Mount Rainier in Washington State is currently dormant.
The volcano could, and probably will erupt again.
Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano.
But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases.
This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber.
This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up.
Eventually the ground shakes.
A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt.
Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.
All that magma and gas pushing upward can make the volcano’s slope begin to swell.
Ground swelling may change the shape of a volcano or cause rock falls and landslides.
Most of the time, the ground tilting is not visible.
Scientists detect it by using tiltmeters, which are instruments that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano.
