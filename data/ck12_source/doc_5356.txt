Though both involve the detachment of the RNA from the DNA template, how this occurs is surprisingly distinct.
Bacteria use two different strategies for transcription termination, Rho-dependent and Rho-independent termination.
In Rho-dependent termination , a protein factor called "Rho" destabilizes the RNA-DNA hybrid, releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex.
In Rho-independent termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a hairpin loop followed by a run of uracils.
This structure is the signal for the detachment of the RNA from the DNA.
The DNA is now ready for translation.
The termination of transcription in eukaryotes is less well understood.
The RNA polymerase transcribes a polyadenylation signal.
Polyadenylation is the addition of a string of A’s to the mRNA’s 3’ end and will be discussed in the Protein Synthesis: mRNA (Advanced) concept.
However, soon after the transcription of this signal, proteins cut the RNA transcript free from the RNA polymerase and the enzyme eventually falls off the DNA.
This process produces a pre-mRNA, an mRNA that is not quite ready to be translated.
Steps of Transcription.
Transcription occurs in the three steps - initiation, elongation, and termination - shown here.
abortive initiation :
Refers to the release of truncated transcripts during the early stages of transcription.
activator :
A protein that enhances the interaction between RNA polymerase and a particular promoter.
core promoter :
The minimal portion of the promoter required to properly initiate transcription.
elongation :
