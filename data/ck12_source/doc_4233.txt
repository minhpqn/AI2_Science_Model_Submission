Have you ever watched a cat trying to catch a mouse?
These are just two examples of the many behaviors of animals.
Animal behavior includes all the ways that animals interact with each other and the environment.
Examples of common animal behaviors are pictured in Figure below .

Can you think of other examples of animal behavior besides the three shown here?
The branch of biology that studies animal behavior is called ethology .
Ethologists usually study how animals behave in their natural environment, rather than in a lab.
They generally try to answer four basic questions about the behaviors they observe:
What causes the behavior?
What is the stimulus , or trigger, for the behavior?
What structures and functions of the animal are involved in the behavior?
How does the behavior develop?
Is it present early in life?
Or does it appear only as the animal matures?
Are certain experiences needed for the behavior to develop?
Why did the behavior evolve?
How does the behavior affect the fitness of the animal performing it?
How does it affect the survival of the species?
