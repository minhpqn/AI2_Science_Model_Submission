The Figure below is an illustration of gas particles exerting pressure inside a container.
The collision of gas molecules with the walls of a container generates pressure
Collision of gas particles with container wall.
The pressure inside the hot air balloon is affected by temperature.
As the molecules heat up, they move faster and strike the inside wall of the balloon harder.
This increased motion of the gas particles increases the force on an area of the balloon, producing a rise in the pressure.
Pressure is defined as \frac{\text{force}}{\text{volume}} .
Gas pressure is the result of collisions between gas particles and an object.
An increase in temperature will produce an increase in pressure of a gas.
