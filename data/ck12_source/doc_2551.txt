The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the Figure above .
For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons.
The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level.
An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found.
As you can see by the images in the Figure below , some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals).
There are other types of orbitals as well.
Models of S and P orbitals
Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons.
Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level.
Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level.
The animation below shows the electrons in the first two energy levels for an atom of lithium, which has a total of three electrons.
Q:
Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons.
How many orbitals does this energy level have?
A:
At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals.
The Outermost Level
Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom have a special significance.
These electrons are called valence electrons, and they determine many of the properties of an atom.
An atom is most stable if its outermost energy level contains as many electrons as it can hold.
