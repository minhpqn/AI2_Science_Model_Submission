The new road is smooth and even.
Over hundreds of years, it will completely disappear.
What happens to that road over one or two years?
What changes would you see ( Figure below )?
What forces of weathering wear down that road, or rocks or mountains over time?
Animations of different types of weathering processes can be found here:
Weathering leads to potholes in roads
One bad winter can cause a road to weather.
The potholes in this road will need to be fixed.
Erosion moves sediments after they have formed.
The sediments are transported away from the place where they form.
There are several agents of erosion.
Flowing water moves and deposits sediments.
Water erodes far more material than any other erosional agent.
Wind is important as an agent of erosion.
This is especially true in arid climates.
Ice, in glaciers, can erode enormous quantities of sediments.
Gravity as a force of erosion pulls material downhill.
Many types of landforms are created by the erosion of sediments.
Some are described later in this chapter.
