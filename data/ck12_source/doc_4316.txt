Ladybugs:
A Population of Millions
Ladybugs, also known as ladybird beetles, have a life cycle of four to six weeks.
In one year as many as six generations of ladybird beetles may hatch.
In the spring, each adult female lays up to 300 eggs in small clusters on plants where aphids are present.
After a week the wingless larvae hatch.
Both the ladybird beetle larvae and adults are active predators, eating only aphids, scales, mites and other plant-eating insects.
The ladybugs live on the vegetation where their prey is found, which includes roses, oleander, milkweed and broccoli.
Adult ladybugs donâ€™t taste very good.
A bird careless enough to try to eat one will not swallow it.
By late May to early June, when the larvae have depleted the food supply, the adults migrate to the mountains.
There, they eat mainly pollen.
The ladybugs gain fat from eating the pollen and this tides them over during their nine-month hibernation.
Thousands of adults hibernate overwinter in tight clusters, called aggregates , under fallen leaves and ground litter near streams.
In the clear, warmer days of early spring, the ladybugs break up the aggregates and begin several days of mating.

Insects and Humans
Most humans interact with insects every day.
Many of these interactions are harmless and often go unnoticed.
