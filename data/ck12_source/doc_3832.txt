This refers to differences between the phenotypes of males and females of the same species.
In humans, for example, males and females have different heights and body shapes.
Stabilizing, disruptive, and directional selection
Natural selection may affect the distribution of a polygenic trait.
These graphs show three ways this can happen.
For a review of natural selection and genetic drift, and how they relate to evolution, see Mutation, natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow are discussed at  (8:45).
Natural selection occurs when there are differences in fitness among members of a population.
Natural selection for a polygenic trait changes the distribution of phenotypes.
It may have a stabilizing, directional, or disruptive effect on the phenotype distribution.
