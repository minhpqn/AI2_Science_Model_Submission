Do the electrons in all atoms follow the Aufbau rule?
What happens to electrons in copper to make the atom more stable?
How does silver become more stable?
What is the Aufbau principle?
Which orbital is filled after the 2 p ?
Which orbital is filled after 4 s ?
Which orbital is filled after 6 s ?
Aufbau principle:
An electron occupies orbitals in order from lowest energy to highest.
Pauli Exclusion Principle
State the Pauli exclusion principle.
Your email address is unique, like an electron's quantum numbers
Can you name one thing that easily distinguishes you from the rest of the world?
And we’re not talking about DNA – that’s a little expensive to sequence.
For many people, it is their email address.
My email address allows people all over the world to contact me.
It does not belong to anyone else, but serves to identify me.
Electrons also have a unique set of identifiers in the quantum numbers that describe their location and spin.
Pauli Exclusion Principle
When we look at the orbital possibilities for a given atom, we see that there are different arrangements of electrons for each different type of atom.
