Now they are trying to identify and characterize all the genes in the genome.
If we are all 99.9% genetically identical, what makes us different?
How does that 0.1% make us tall or short, light or dark, develop cancer or not?
To understand that 0.1%, we also need to understand the other 99.9%.
Understanding the human genome is the goal of the Human Genome Project.
This project, publicly funded by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) ( Figure below ); and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) , part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , may be one of the landmark scientific events of our lifetime.
As stated above, the goal of the HGP is to understand the genetic make-up of the human species by determining the DNA sequence of the human genome ( Figure below ) and the genome of a few model organisms.
However, it is not just determining the 3 billion bases; it is understanding what they mean.
How many human genes are there?
Do these genes encode transcription factors, transport proteins, growth factors, structural proteins, or oncogenes?
Or any of the other various types of proteins?
Does a base change in the consensus sequence of a gene cause a genetic disease?
What is the phenotype associated with mutations in a specific gene?
Because of the HGP, these questions can be addressed.
The genes in the genome are in the process of being identified and characterized, as are the proteins associated with those genes.
A preliminary estimate of the number of genes in the human genome is around 22,000 to 23,000.

The sequence of the human DNA is stored in databases available to anyone on the Internet.
