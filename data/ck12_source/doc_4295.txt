Use this figure to compare and contrast gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods
Mollusks reproduce sexually.
Most species have separate male and female sexes.
Gametes are released into the mantle cavity.
Fertilization may be internal or external, depending on the species.
Fertilized eggs develop into larvae.
There may be one or more larval stages.
Each one is different from the adult stage.
Mollusks have a unique larval form called a trochophore .
It is a tiny organism with cilia for swimming.
Ecology of Mollusks
Mollusks live in most terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats.
However, the majority of species live in the ocean.
They can be found in both shallow and deep water and from tropical to polar latitudes.
Mollusks are a major food source for other organisms, including humans.
You may have eaten mollusks such as clams, oysters, scallops, or mussels.
The different classes of mollusks have different ways of obtaining food.
Gastropods may be herbivores, predators, or internal parasites.
They live in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.
