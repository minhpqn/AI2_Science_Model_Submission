Is Earth a living organism?
Most scientists agree that the Earth itself is not a living thing.
However, the Earth does have some aspects of life.
Some scientists argue that the Earth maintains homeostasis, a stable state, just like a living organisms.
The highest level of ecological organization is the biosphere .
It is the part of Earth, including the air, land, surface rocks, and water, where life is found.
Parts of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere make up the biosphere.
The lithosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth's crust; essentially land is part of the lithosphere.
The hydrosphere is composed of all the areas that contain water, which can be found on, under, and over the surface of Earth.
The atmosphere is the layer of gas that surrounds the planet.
The biosphere includes the area from about 11,000 meters below sea level to 15,000 meters above sea level.
