Can you see that would be the slope of this graph? (slope = rise over run and in this case the ‘rise’ is position and the ‘run’ is time).
Find the instantaneous speed at t = 20 sec.
a. 8 m; 20 s ; 0.05 Hz; b. – 4 m c. \sim 2.3 m/s
Use the wave equation to solve problems.
Students will learn how to use the wave equation to solve problems.

Guidance The wave equation is analogous to distance equals rate multiplied by time equation for one cycle.
Here the distance is a wavelength and the time is the period.
We simply divide both sides by the period, to get speed of the wave equals the wavelength multiplied by one over the period.
This is equivalent to wavelength multiplied by frequency, since frequency equals one of the period by definition.
While on vacation in Hawaii you observe waves at the Banzai Pipeline approaching the shore at 6.0 m/s.
You also note that the distance between waves is 28 m.
Calculate (a) the frequency of the waves and (b) the period.
Question a : f= ? [Hz]
Given: v = 6.0 \ m/s
{\;} \qquad \quad \lambda = 28 \ m
Equation: v = f \cdot \lambda therefore f = \frac{v}{\lambda}
