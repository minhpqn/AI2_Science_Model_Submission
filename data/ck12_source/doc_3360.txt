What does Tamara’s device show?
A:
The device shows that you can use electricity to create magnetism.
Electricity and Magnetism
Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism .
Today, electromagnetism is used in many electric devices.
However, until electromagnetism was discovered, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated.
A Danish scientist named Hans Christian Oersted (pictured in the Figure below ) changed all that.
He made the important discovery that electric current creates a magnetic field.
But like many other important discoveries in science, Oersted’s discovery was just a lucky accident.
Hans Christian Oersted
An Accidental Discovery
In 1820, Oersted was presenting a demonstration to some science students.
Ironically, he was trying to show them that electricity and magnetism are not related.
He placed a wire with electric current flowing through it next to a compass, which has a magnetic needle.
As he expected, the needle of the compass didn’t move.
It just kept pointing toward Earth’s north magnetic pole.
After the demonstration, a curious student held the wire near the compass again, but in a different direction.
To Oersted’s surprise, the needle of the compass swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing north.
Oersted was intrigued.
