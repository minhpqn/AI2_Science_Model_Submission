The term theory is sometimes stretched to refer to theoretical speculation which is currently unverifiable.
A couple examples of such uses include string theory and the theory of everything.
String theory is a model of physics, which predicts the existence of many more dimensions in the universe than the four dimensions that current science understands (length, width, height, and space-time).
The theory of everything is a hypothetical theory in physics that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena.
For a scientific theory to be valid, it must be verified experimentally.
Many parts of the string theory are currently untestable due to the large amount of energy that would be needed to carry out the necessary experiments as well as the high cost of conducting these experiments.
Therefore string theory may not be tested in the foreseeable future.
Some scientists have even questioned whether it deserves to be called a scientific theory because it is not falsifiable.
A superseded theory , or obsolete scientific theory is a theory that was once commonly accepted, but for a given reason is no longer considered the most complete description of reality by mainstream science.
It can also refer to a falsifiable theory which has been shown to be false.
Giraffes, shown in Figure below , are often used in the explanation of Lamarck's superseded theory of evolution.
In Lamarckism, a giraffe lengthens its neck over the course of its life in order to, for example, reach higher leaves.
That giraffe will then have offspring with longer necks.
