What does the  K_{sp} tell us?
Which of the lead salts listed in the table above is the most soluble?
What is the exponent for an ion in the equation?
solubility product constant, (K_{sp}) :
The mathematical product of the ions each raised to the power of the coefficient of the ion in the dissociation equation.
Conversion of Solubility to Ksp
Define molar solubility.
Perform calculations involving molar solubility and K_{sp} .
The production of baking soda relies on the precipitation of baking soda out of solution
How is baking soda made?
Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is prepared by bubbling carbon dioxide gas through a solution of ammonia and sodium chloride.
Ammonium carbonate is first formed which then reacts with the NaCl to form sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride.
The sodium bicarbonate is less soluble than the other materials, so it will precipitate out of solution.
Conversion of Solubility to  K_{sp}
Solubility is normally expressed in g/L of saturated solution.
However, solubility can also be expressed as the moles per liter.
Molar solubility is the number of moles of solute in one liter of saturated solution.
In other words, the molar solubility of a given compound represents the highest molarity solution that is possible for that compound.
The molar mass of a compound is the conversion factor between solubility and molar solubility.
Given that the solubility of Zn(OH) 2 is 4.2 Ã— 10 -4  g/L, the molar solubility can be calculated as shown below:
