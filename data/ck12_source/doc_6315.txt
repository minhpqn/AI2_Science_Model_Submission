It consists of two bimolecular elementary steps.
Step 1: \text{H}_2 \text{O}_2(aq)+\text{I}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+ \text{IO}^-(aq)
Step 2: \text{H}_2 \text{O}_2(aq)+\text{IO}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{H}_2 \text{O}(l)+ \text{O}_2 + \text{I}^-( aq)
If step 1 is the rate-determining step, then the rate law for that step will be the rate law for the overall reaction.
The rate law for the slow step of the proposed mechanism agrees with the overall experimentally determined rate law.
The IO − is present as an intermediate in the reaction.
The iodide ion catalyst also appears in the mechanism.
It is consumed in the first elementary step and then is regenerated in the second step.
That is the requirement for a catalyst – that is that it is not used up in the reaction.
The rate-determining step in a reaction is defined.
The process for determining the rate-determining step is described.

What is the rate-limiting step in a reaction?
Can we determine the rate-limiting step simply by looking at the reaction mechanism?
In the hydrogen peroxide example above, why was step 1 determined to be the rate-limiting step?
