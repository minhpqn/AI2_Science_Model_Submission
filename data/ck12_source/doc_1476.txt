Therefore, water closer to shore tends to have more nutrients.
Living things need nutrients.
So distance from shore also influences how many organisms live in the water.
Zones Based on Depth of Water
Scientists refer to the vertical extent of ocean water as the water column .
Two main zones based on depth of water are the photic zone and aphotic zone.
The photic zone is the top 200 meters of water.
The aphotic zone is water deeper than 200 meters.
The deeper you go, the darker the water gets.
Thatâ€™s because sunlight cannot penetrate very far under water.
Sunlight is needed for photosynthesis.
So the depth of water determines whether photosynthesis is possible.
There is enough sunlight for photosynthesis only in the photic zone.
Water also gets colder as you go deeper.
The weight of the water pressing down from above increases as well.
At great depths, life becomes very difficult.
The pressure is so great that only specially adapted creatures can live there.
The small surface zone that has light is the photic zone.
The entire rest of the ocean does not have light and is the aphotic zone.
The ocean is divided into horizontal zones based on the depth of water beneath: the intertidal, neritic, and oceanic.
