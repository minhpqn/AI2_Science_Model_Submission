What group of animals begins its life in the water, but then spends most of its life on land?
Amphibians!
Amphibians are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land.
Amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills.
The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen.
There are approximately 6,000 species of amphibians.
They have many different body types, physiologies, and habitats, ranging from tropical to subarctic regions.
Frogs, toads, salamanders ( Figure below ), newts, and caecilians are all types of amphibians.

How did Amphibians Adapt to Living on Land?
Transition to life on land meant significant changes to both external and internal features.
In order to live on land, amphibians replaced gills with another respiratory organ, the lungs.
Other adaptations include:
Skin that prevents loss of water.
Eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water.
An eardrum developed to separate the external ear from the middle ear.
A tail that disappears in adulthood (in frogs and toads).
Classification of the Amphibians
Like fish, amphibians are ectothermic vertebrates.
