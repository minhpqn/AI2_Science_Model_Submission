Astronauts' footprints are now on the Moon.
They will remain unchanged for thousands of years, because there is no wind, rain, or living thing to disturb them.
A falling meteorite could destroy them.
Tiny micrometeorites bombard the Moon's surface and smooth it over time too.
The landscape of the Moon—its surface features—is very different from Earth.
The lunar landscape is covered by craters caused by meteoroid impacts ( Figure below ). ( Lunar means relating to the Moon.) The craters are bowl-shaped basins on the Moon’s surface.
Because the Moon has no water, wind, or weather, the craters remain unchanged.
The Moon's coldest temperatures are found deep in the craters.
The coldest craters are at the south pole on the Moon's far side.
The Sun never shines on the bottoms of the deepest craters.
These temperatures are amongst the coldest in our entire solar system.
Craters on the surface of the moon
Craters, like the one shown in this image, are found on the surface of the Moon.
When you look at the Moon from Earth, you notice dark and light areas.
The maria are dark, solid, flat areas of lava (mostly basalt).
Maria covers around 16% of the Moon’s surface, mostly on the near side.
The maria formed about 3.0 to 4.0 billion years ago, when the Moon was continually bombarded by meteoroids ( Figure below ).
Large meteorites broke through the Moon’s newly formed surface.
This eventually caused magma to flow out and fill the craters.
Scientists estimate volcanic activity on the Moon ended about 1.2 billion years ago.
