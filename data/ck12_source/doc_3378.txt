If you decrease the voltage of the direct current, how does the voltage of the pickup current change?
How does the number of loops in the pickup coil affect the voltage in that circuit?
What is an electric transformer?
How does an electric transformer use electromagnetic induction?
Compare and contrast step-up and step-down transformers.
Describe an electrical grid.
Identify the roles of power plants, transmission lines, and electric substations in an electrical grid.
These electric power towers carry high-voltage electric lines.
The lines transmit electricity from power plants to homes like yours.
The towers are a crucial part of the electrical grid.
What Is an Electrical Grid?
An electrical grid is the entire electrical system that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power throughout a region or country.
A very simple electrical grid is sketched in the Figure below .
The grid includes a power plant, transmission lines, and electric substations, all of which work together to provide alternating current to customers.

Schematic of a typical power grid
Electricity originates in power plants.
They have electric generators that produce electricity by electromagnetic induction.
In this process, a changing magnetic field is used to generate electric current.
