Q = mc \Delta t ,
where  Q is the heat gained or lost,  m is the mass of the object, c is its specific heat, and  \Delta t is the change in temperature.
You should note that the size of a Celsius degree and a Kelvin degree are exactly the same, and therefore  \Delta t is the same whether measured in Celsius or Kelvin.
Example Problem:  A 0.500 kg block of zinc is heated from 295 K to K.
How much heat was absorbed by the zinc?
Solution:
Q = mc \Delta t = (0.500 \ kg)(388 \ J/kg \cdot K)(350. \ K - 295 \ K) = 10,600 \ J
Example Problem:  845 J of heat are added to a 0.200 kg block of aluminum at a temperature of 312.00 K.
How high will the temperature of the aluminum rise?
Solution: (t_2-t_1)=\frac{Q}{mc}=\frac{845 \ J}{(0.200 \ kg)(903 \ J/kg \cdot K)}=4.68 \ K
t_2 = t_1 + 4.68 \ K = 312.00 \ K + 4.68 \ K = 316.68 \ K
When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature.
The amount of temperature increase depends on three things:  1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made.
Each substance has a specific heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit.
The amount of heat gained or lost by an object when its temperature changes can be calculated by the formula Q = mc \Delta t .
