This may assist other scientists with their investigations.
Any of these things may lead to new investigations and new data.
The scientific community monitors scientific integrity.
During their training, students learn how to conduct good scientific experiments.
They learn not to fake, hide, or selectively report data.
They learn how to fairly evaluate data.
They learn how to interpret the work of other scientists.
Scientists who do not have scientific integrity are strongly condemned by the scientific community.
Sometimes scientists are hired by private companies to do studies.
Often these scientists find what the company wants them to find.
These studies should be evaluated very carefully before the results are used.
However, often the studies are taken seriously by the media.
It is important to know who funded the research to know how to evaluate the results of a study.
Nothing is perfect, and science isn't either.
Still, considering all the scientific research that is done, there are few incidences of scientific dishonesty.
When they do occur, they are often reported with great vehemence by the media.
This may cause the public to mistrust scientists in ways that are unwarranted.
If science is done well, other scientists who replicate the same work will get the same results.
Scientists peer review a scientific paper before it is published.
This is done to be sure the work was done using the scientific method.
