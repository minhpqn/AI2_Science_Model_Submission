The metabolic rate and activity level can also remain high regardless of the outside temperature.
On the other hand, maintaining a stable body temperature requires more energyâ€”and more food.
The earliest vertebrates resembled hagfish and lived more than 500 million years ago.
As other classes of fish appeared, they evolved traits such as a complete vertebral column, jaws, and a bony endoskeleton.
Amphibians were the first tetrapod vertebrates as well as the first vertebrates to live on land.
Reptiles were the first amniotic vertebrates.
Mammals and birds, which both descended from reptile-like ancestors, evolved endothermy, or the ability to regulate body temperature from the inside.
