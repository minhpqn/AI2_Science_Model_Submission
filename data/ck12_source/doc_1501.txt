Dispersal:
Use chemicals to get the oil to disperse, called chemical dispersants .
Some scientists think that the harm to the environment from the dispersants is as great as the harm from the oil.
The total effect of the oil spill on the environment of the Gulf is not yet known.
Oil is found in the sediments on the seafloor.
Many people who fish or are involved in Gulf tourism were also impacted.
Studies of the effects of the oil spill on people and animals will continue for many years.
What You Can Do
Small amounts of oil leak into the oceans from wells or ships.
By reducing the amount of oil and gas you use, you decrease the need for these commodities.
Also, be sure to dispose of motor oil correctly.
Motor oil poured down a sewage grate can end up in the sea.
It's important to be sure that companies follow environmental regulations.
They must also be cautious when they drill or transport oil in the oceans.
People can demand that companies protect the ocean environment.
Most ocean pollution comes from land and most is found near the coasts.
Most of this trash is plastic.
Plastic trash does not usually biodegrade in the ocean but just forms tiny plastic molecules.
Massive amounts of oil that have been spilled into a water body can be removed, contained, or dispersed.
This is not easy or complete.
