All group 15 elements have five valence electrons, but they vary in their reactivity.
Nitrogen, for example, is not very reactive at all, whereas phosphorus is very reactive and found naturally only in combination with other substances.
All group 15 elements are solids, except for nitrogen, which is a gas.
Arsenic is used in rat poison
The most common form of the metalloid arsenic is gray and shiny.
Arsenic is extremely toxic, so it is used as rat poison.
Surprisingly, we need it (in tiny amounts) for normal growth and a healthy nervous system.
Group 16:
Oxygen Group
Group 16 of the periodic table is also called the oxygen group.
The first three elements—oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se)—are nonmetals.
They are followed by tellurium (Te) ( Figure below ), a metalloid, and polonium (Po), a metal.
All group 16 elements have six valence electrons and are very reactive.
Oxygen is a gas at room temperature, and the other elements in the group are solids.
Tellurium is used in solar panels
Tellurium is a silvery white, brittle metalloid.
It is toxic and may cause birth defects.
Tellurium can conduct electricity when exposed to light, so it is used to make solar panels.
It has several other uses as well.
For example, it makes steel and copper easier to work with and lends color to ceramics.
