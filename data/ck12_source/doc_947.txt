Half-lives of Various Substances
4.5 × 10 9 years
Example Problem: 4.00 grams of tritium (hydrogen-3) are produced in the lab.
How much of it will remain after 24.6 years?
Solution: 24.6 years is two half-lives for hydrogen-3, so \frac{1}{4} of the original amount will remain.
That would be 1.00 gram.
In all nuclear reactions, the total of the atomic numbers on the left side of the equation must equal the total of the atomic numbers on the right side of the equation.
The sum of the mass numbers on the left of the equation must equal the sum of the mass numbers on the right of the equation.
The breakup of a larger nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei is called fission .
The joining together of two or more smaller nuclei to form a larger one is called fusion.
The time required for half of the atoms in any given quantity of a radioactive substance to decay is the half-life of that element.
