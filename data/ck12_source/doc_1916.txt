The isotopes listed below ( Table below ) are used to date igneous rocks.
These isotopes have much longer half-lives than carbon-14.
Because they decay more slowly, they can be used to date much older specimens.
Which of these isotopes could be used to date a rock that formed half a million years ago?
How about half a billion years ago?
At a Half-Life of (years)
Dates Rocks Aged (years old)
100 thousand – 1 billion
1 million – 4.5 billion
1 million – 4.5 billion
Limitations of Radiometric Dating
Radiometric dating is a very useful tool, but it does have limits:
The material being dated must have measurable amounts of the parent and/or the daughter isotopes.
Radiometric dating can only be done on some materials.
It is not useful for determining the age of sedimentary rocks.
For this, geologists date a nearby igneous rock.
Then they use relative dating techniques to figure out the age of the sedimentary rock.
They may not get it exactly, but there will be some idea.
Radiocarbon is useful for relatively young, carbon-based materials.
Other longer-lived isotopes are good for older rocks and minerals.
