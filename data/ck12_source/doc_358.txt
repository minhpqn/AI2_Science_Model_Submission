If you exercise aerobically, overtime, your muscles will not get easily tired, and you will use oxygen more efficiently.
Aerobic exercise ( Figure below ) also helps improve cardiac muscle.
Regularly done aerobic activities can help build up endurance and make the heart stronger
When done regularly, aerobic activities, such as cycling, make the heart stronger.
Other aerobic activities include mowing lawn, shoveling snow and cross country skiing.
Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly.
A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity.
Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate.
Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured.
For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.
Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).
When you don't do a proper warm-up, several types of injuries can occur.
A strain happens when muscle or tendons tear.
Strains are also known as "pulled muscles." Another common injury is tendinitis , the irritation of the tendons.
Strains and tendinitis are usually treated with rest, cold compresses, and stretching exercises that a physical therapist designs for each patient.
Injuries can also be prevented by proper rest and recovery.
If you do not get enough rest, your body will become injured and will not react well to exercise, or improve.
You can also rest by doing a different activity.
For example, if you run, you can rest your running muscles and joints by swimming.
Warming up before an intense activity helps avoid injries
