Therefore, every person that has ever lived - except for identical twins - has his or her own unique set of blueprints - or instructions - or DNA.
Nucleic acids are organic compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
They are made of smaller units called nucleotides .
Nucleic acids are named for the nucleus of the cell, where some of them are found.
Nucleic acids are found not only in all living cells but also in viruses.
Types of nucleic acids include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) .
Structure of Nucleic Acids
A nucleic acid consists of one chain (in RNA) or two chains (in DNA) of nucleotides held together by chemical bonds.
Each individual nucleotide unit consists of three parts:
a base (containing nitrogen)
a sugar (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA)
a phosphate group (containing phosphorus)
The sugar of one nucleotide binds to the phosphate group of the next nucleotide.
Alternating sugars and phosphate groups form the backbone of a nucleotide chain, as shown in Figure below .
The bases, which are bound to the sugars, protrude from the backbone of the chain.
In DNA, pairs of bases-one from each of two nucleotides-form the middle section of the molecule.
Part of a Nucleic Acid (DNA).
This small section of a nucleic acid shows how phosphate groups and sugars alternate to form the backbone of a nucleotide chain.
The bases that jut out to the side from the backbone are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.
Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, such as between adenine and thymine, hold the two chains of nucleotides together.
