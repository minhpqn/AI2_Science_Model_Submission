If John walks once around the block, what distance does he travel?
If John walks once around the block, what is his final displacement?
Joanna's house is 8000 feet due west of her school.
If her house is assigned the position of zero and her school is assigned the position of +8000, what would be Joanna's position if she walked 100 feet west of her house?
distance:
The space between two objects but this is not adequate when considering the  distance travelled .
The distance travelled cannot be negative and can never get smaller â€“ in this sense, distance is the total length of path traversed by the moving body irrespective of direction.
displacement:  The vector from the initial position to a subsequent position assumed by a body.
Explain the difference between speed and velocity.
Define the concept of average velocity.
Determine how to calculate average velocity using the equation, v_{\text{av}}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
Test Pilot Neil Armstrong is seen standing next to the X-15 ship after a research flight
Test Pilot Neil Armstrong (later to become a famous astronaut) is seen here next to the X-15 ship after a research flight.
The servo-actuated ball nose, seen at Armstrong's right hand, provided accurate measurement of air speed at hypersonic speeds.
The X-15 was flown over a period of nearly 10 years, and set the world's unofficial speed record of 4,250 mph.
In ordinary language, the words speed and velocity both refer to how fast an object is moving, and are often used interchangeably.
In physics, however, they are fundamentally different.
Speed  is the magnitude of an object's motion, with no regard for the direction.
Velocity , on the other hand, includes direction.
It is a vector, and thus must have a magnitude and a direction.
