They feed on plankton or other nekton.
Examples of nekton include fish and shrimp.
Benthos are aquatic organisms that crawl in sediments at the bottom of a body of water.
Many are decomposers.
Benthos include sponges, clams, and anglerfish like the one in Figure below .
How has this fish adapted to a life in the dark?
An anglerfish is an organism that falls into the benthos group
Anglerfish.
This anglerfish lives between 1000 and 4000 meters below sea level.
No sunlight penetrates to this depth.
The rod-like structure on its face has a glow-in-the-dark tip.
It is covered with microorganisms that give off their own light.
The fish wiggles the structure like a worm to attract prey.
In the darkness, only the rod-like worm is visible.

Studying Aquatic Animals
Oceans cover more than 70 percent of our planet, yet they are some of the least explored regions on Earth.
Who better to unlock the mysteries of the ocean than marine animals themselves?
Marine scientists have been tagging and tracking sharks, leatherback turtles, and other sea life to learn more about marine ecosystems.
Through the Tagging of Pacific Predators program (TOPP), scientists hope to assess and explain the migration routes, ecosystems, and diversity of our oceansâ€™ species.
