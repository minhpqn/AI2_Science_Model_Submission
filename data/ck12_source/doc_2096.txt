Describe the consequences of using nuclear energy.
Where could long-term nuclear waste go?
That's a very good question.
For years, a waste facility was in development in Nevada.
The site at Yucca Mountain was canceled due to public outcry.
Now there is no facility for storing long-term nuclear waste from most sources.
No facilities are currently being developed either.
Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nucleus of an atom.
This releases a huge amount of energy.
How Nuclear Power Plants Work
Nuclear power plants use uranium that has been concentrated in fuel rods ( Figure below ).
The uranium atoms are split apart when they are hit by other extremely tiny particles.
These particles must be controlled or they would cause a dangerous explosion.
Picture of a nuclear power plant in France
Nuclear power plants like this one provide France with almost 80% of its electricity.
Nuclear power plants use the energy they produce to heat water.
The water turns into steam, which causes a turbine to spin.
This, in turn, produces electricity.
Nuclear Power as a Resource
Many countries around the world use nuclear energy as a source of electricity.
