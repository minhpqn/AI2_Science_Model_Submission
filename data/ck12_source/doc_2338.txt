Wheels really changed human life.
They revolutionized transportation and made it much easier to do many different kinds of work.
How Technology Affects Society
Important new technologies such as the wheel have had a big impact on human society.
Major advances in technology have influenced every aspect of life, including transportation, food production, manufacturing, communication, medicine, and the arts.
That’s because technology has the goal of solving human problems, so new technologies usually make life better.
They may make work easier, for example, or make people healthier.
Sometimes, however, new technologies affect people in negative ways.
For example, using a new product or process might cause human health problems or pollute the environment.
Q:
Can you think of a modern technology that has both positive and negative effects on people?
A:
Modern methods of transportation have both positive and negative effects on people.
They help people and goods move quickly all over the world.
However, most of them pollute the environment.
For example, gasoline-powered cars and trucks add many pollutants to the atmosphere.
The pollutants harm people’s health and contribute to global climate change.
Few technologies have impacted society as greatly as the powerful steam engine developed by Scottish inventor James Watt in 1775 (see Figure below ).
Watt’s steam engine was soon being used to power all kinds of machines.
It started a revolution in industry.
