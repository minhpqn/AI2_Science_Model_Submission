Wood fragments from old buildings and ancient ruins can be age dated.
The outermost ring gives the date when the tree died.
An example of how tree-ring dating is used to date houses in the United Kingdom is found in the following article:
Other processes create yearly layers that can be used for dating.
On a glacier, snow falls in winter.
In summer, dust accumulates.
This leads to a snow-dust annual pattern.
This pattern can be seen down into the ice ( Figure below ).
Scientists drill deep into ice sheets.
Ice cores can be hundreds of meters long.
The ice cores show how the environment has changed.
Gas bubbles in the ice can be analyzed to show how atmospheric gases have changed.
This can yield clues about climate.
Long ice cores have allowed scientists to create a record of polar climate going back hundreds of thousands of years.

Lake sediments also have an annual pattern.
This is easy to see in lakes that are located at the end of glaciers.
The glacier melts rapidly in the summer.
This produces a thick deposit of sediment in the lake.
