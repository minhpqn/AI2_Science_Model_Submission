Kinetochores on the spindle attach to the centromeres of sister chromatids.
During metaphase , spindle fibers attach to the centromere of each pair of sister chromatids (see Figure below ).
The sister chromatids line up at the equator, or center, of the cell.
This is also known as the metaphase plate.
The spindle fibers ensure that sister chromatids will separate and go to different daughter cells when the cell divides.
Sister chromatids line up during metaphase
Chromosomes, consisting of sister chromatids, line up at the equator or middle of the cell during metaphase.
During anaphase , sister chromatids separate and the centromeres divide.
The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the shortening of the spindle fibers.
This is like reeling in a fish by shortening the fishing line.
One sister chromatid moves to one pole of the cell, and the other sister chromatid moves to the opposite pole.
At the end of anaphase, each pole of the cell has a complete set of chromosomes.
During telophase , the chromosomes begin to uncoil and form chromatin.
This prepares the genetic material for directing the metabolic activities of the new cells.
The spindle also breaks down, and new nuclear membranes (nuclear envelope) form.
Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes.
During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm splits in two and the cell divides.
Cytokinesis occurs somewhat differently in plant and animal cells, as shown in Figure below .
In animal cells, the plasma membrane of the parent cell pinches inward along the cellâ€™s equator until two daughter cells form.
In plant cells, a cell plate forms along the equator of the parent cell.
