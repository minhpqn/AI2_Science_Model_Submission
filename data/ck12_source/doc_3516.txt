The cytoplasm consists of everything inside the plasma membrane of the cell, excluding the nucleus in a eukaryotic cell.
It includes the watery, gel-like material called cytosol , as well as various structures.
The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two thirds of the cellâ€™s weight and gives the cell many of its properties.
Functions of the Cytoplasm
The cytoplasm has several important functions, including:
suspending cell organelles.
pushing against the plasma membrane to help the cell keep its shape.
providing a site for many of the biochemical reactions of the cell.
The cytoskeleton is a cellular "scaffolding" or "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm.
All eukaryotic cells have a cytoskeleton, and recent research has shown that prokaryotic cells also have a cytoskeleton.
The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is made up of a network of long, thin protein fibers and has many functions.
It helps to maintain cell shape.
It holds organelles in place, and for some cells, it enables cell movement.
The cytoskeleton also plays important roles in both the intracellular movement of substances and in cell division.
Certain proteins act like a path that vesicles and organelles move along within the cell.
The threadlike proteins that make up the cytoskeleton continually rebuild to adapt to the cell's constantly changing needs.
Three main kinds of cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments.
Microtubules , shown in Figure below (a) , are hollow cylinders and are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures.
They are most commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin, and radiate outwards from an area near the nucleus called the centrosome.
Tubulin is the protein that forms microtubules.
