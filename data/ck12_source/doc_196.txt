If an object has zero velocity, does that mean it has zero acceleration?  Give an example.
If the acceleration of a motorboat is 4.0 m/s 2 , and the motorboat starts from rest, what is its velocity after 6.0 s?
The friction of the water on a boat produces an acceleration of -10. m/s 2 .
If the boat is traveling at 30. m/s and the motor is shut off, how long it take the boat to slow down to 5.0 m/s?
uniform acceleration:
Acceleration that does not change in time is uniform or constant acceleration.
Displacement During Constant Acceleration
Plot and interpret a velocity vs time graph.
Find the area under a curve on a velocity vs time graph and calculate the displacement from such a graph.
Calculate the displacement of an object undergoing uniform acceleration when given two of the three quantities acceleration, time, velocity.
Long distance runners, such as this woman running by the lake, try to keep constant velocity
Long distance runners try to maintain constant velocity with very little acceleration or deceleration to conserve energy.
Displacement During Constant Acceleration
When acceleration is constant, there are three equations that relate displacement to two of the other three quantities we use to describe motion â€“ time, velocity, and acceleration.
These equations only work when acceleration is constant, but there are, fortunately, quite a few cases of motion where the acceleration is constant.
One of the most common, if we ignore air resistance, are objects falling due to gravity.
When an object is moving with constant velocity, the displacement can be found by multiplying the velocity by the time interval, as shown in the equation below
d = vt
If the object is moving with constant acceleration, but not a constant velocity, we can use a derivation of this equation.
Instead of using v , as velocity, we must calculate and use the average velocity using this equation:
