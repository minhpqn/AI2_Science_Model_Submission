Your body needs proteins to create muscles, regulate chemical reactions, transport oxygen, and perform other important tasks in your body.
But how are these proteins built?
They are made up of units called amino acids.
Just like there are only a few types of blocks in a set, there are a limited number of amino acids.
But there are many different ways in which they can be combined.
Introduction to Protein Synthesis
A monomer is a molecule that can bind to other monomers to form a polymer.
Amino acids are the monomers of a protein.
The DNA sequence contains the instructions to place amino acids into a specific order.
When the amino acid monomers are assembled in that specific order, proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis.
In short, DNA contains the instructions to create proteins.
But DNA does not directly make the proteins.
Proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, and DNA (in an eukaryotic cell) is in the nucleus.
So the cell uses an RNA intermediate to produce proteins.
Each strand of DNA has many separate sequences that code for a specific protein.
Insulin is an example of a protein made by your cells ( Figure below ).
Units of DNA that contain code for the creation of a protein are called genes .

Each blue or purple bead represents a different amino acid.
