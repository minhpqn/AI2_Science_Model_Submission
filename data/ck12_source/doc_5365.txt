As there are 20 amino acids, the code must consist of at least three letters.
In 1961, Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner demonstrated the presence of codons , that is, three bases of RNA that code for one amino acid ( Figure below ).
Also in 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) demonstrated that a poly(U) RNA sequence was translated into a polypeptide consisting of only the amino acid phenylalanine.
This proved that the codon UUU coded for the amino acid phenylalanine.
Extending this work, Nirenberg and his coworkers were able to determine the nucleotide makeup of 54 of the 64 codons.
Others determined the remainder of the genetic code ( Figure below ).
In DNA words are three letters long at , Nirenberg talks about cracking the genetic code.
The mRNA is divided into three-base segments called codons.
A codon is the segment of nucleotides that codes for an amino acid, or for a start or stop signal.
There are 64 codons.
The Genetic Code.
The Genetic Code:
Codons are in the mRNA sequence.
The three letter and one letter code for the amino acids are shown.
To read the code, find the first base on the left, the second base at the top, and the third base in the center of the table.
For example, the codon GGG codes for the amino acid glycine (as does GGC, GGA, and GGU), CCG codes for Proline, UUA codes for Leucine, and AAG codes for Lysine.
There are 64 codons that code for 20 amino acids and three stop codons, so an amino acid may have more than one corresponding codon.
Start and Stop Codons
The codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine.
This codon is also the start codon which begins every translation of every amino acid chain.
