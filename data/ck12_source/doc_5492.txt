Seventy-seven percent of the transgenic crops were developed for herbicide tolerance in soybean, corn, and cotton, 15% were Bt crops for insect resistance, and 8% were developed with genes for both insect resistance and herbicide tolerance in cotton and corn.
Production of Vaccines in Crop Plants
Most little children hate shots.
And many children in parts of the world do not even have access to vaccines.
But what if these vaccines were available in an edible form?
Modern biotechnology is increasingly being applied for novel uses other than food.
Banana trees and tomato plants have been genetically engineered to produce vaccines in their fruit.
If future clinical trials prove successful, the advantages of edible vaccines would be enormous, especially for developing countries.
The transgenic plants could be grown locally and cheaply.
Edible vaccines would not require the use of syringes, which, in addition to being unpleasant, can be a source of infections if contaminated.
Scientists have created a transgenic purple tomato that contains a cancer-fighting compound and others that have high levels of antioxidants (see Figure below ).

Transgenic Purple Tomato.
A purple tomato is genetically modified to contain high levels of antioxidants.
A gene for the compound was transferred into normal red tomatoes.

Nonliving, as in the non-living aspects of an ecosystem: soil, water, weather, climate, etc.
