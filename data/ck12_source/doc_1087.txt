The smallest loops are the higher elevations on the hill.
The larger loops encircling the smaller loops are downhill.
If you look at the map, you can see Cady Hill in the lower left and another, smaller hill in the upper right.
Concentric circles on a topographic map indicate a hill
Portion of a USGS topographic map of Stowe, VT.
Cady Hill (elevation 1122 feet) is shown by concentric circles in the lower left portion of the map.
Another hill (elevation ~ 960 feet) is on the upper right portion of the map.
Hatched concentric circles indicate a depression .
The hatch marks are short, perpendicular lines inside the circle.
The innermost hatched circle represents the deepest part of the depression ( Figure below ).
The outer hatched circles represent higher elevations.
On a contour map, a circle with inward hatches indicates a depression
On a contour map, a circle with inward hatches indicates a depression.
V-shaped portions of contour lines indicate stream valleys .
The “V“ shape of the contour lines point uphill.
There is a V shape because the stream channel passes through the point of the V.
The open end of the V represents the downstream portion.
A blue line indicates that there is water running through the valley.
If there is not a blue line, the V pattern indicates which way water flows.
Below, you can see examples of V-shaped markings ( Figure below ).
