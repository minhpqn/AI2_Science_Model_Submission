Some scientists argued that electromagnetic radiation consists of particles that shoot around like tiny bullets.
Other scientists argued that electromagnetic radiation consists of waves, like sound waves or water waves.
Until the early 1900s, most scientists thought that electromagnetic radiation is either one or the other and that scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong.
Q:
Do you think electromagnetic radiation is a wave or a particle?
A:
Here’s a hint: it may not be a question of either-or.

A New Theory
In 1905, the physicist Albert Einstein developed a new theory about electromagnetic radiation.
The theory is often called the wave-particle theory .
It explains how electromagnetic radiation can behave as both a wave and a particle.
Einstein argued that when an electron returns to a lower energy level and gives off electromagnetic energy, the energy is released as a discrete “packet” of energy.
We now call such a packet of energy a photon .
According to Einstein, a photon resembles a particle but moves like a wave.
You can see this in the Figure below .
The theory posits that waves of photons traveling through space or matter make up electromagnetic radiation.

Energy of a Photon
A photon isn’t a fixed amount of energy.
