Myriapoda are mostly found in moist forests, where they help to break down decaying plant material.
A few live in grasslands, semi-arid habitats, or even deserts.
Most myriapods are decomposers, with the majority herbivores breaking down decaying plant material, but centipedes are nighttime predators.
Centipedes roam around looking for small animals to bite and eat; their prey includes insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates.
If the centipede is large enough, it will even attack small vertebrates, like lizards.
Although not generally considered dangerous to humans, many from this group can cause temporary blistering and discoloration of the skin.
Centipedes ("hundred feet") ( Figure below ) are fast, predatory carnivores, and venomous.
There are around 3,300 described species, ranging from one tiny species (less than half an inch in length) to one giant species (the Peruvian giant yellow-leg centipede or Amazonian giant centipede), which may grow larger than 12 inches.
This giant centipede has been known to attack, kill and eat much larger animals, including tarantulas.
Centipedes have one pair of legs per body segment, with the first pair of legs behind the head modified into a pair of fangs containing a poison gland.
Many centipedes also guard their eggs and young by curling around them.

Most millipedes are slower than centipedes and feed on leaf litter and loose organic material.
They can be distinguished from centipedes by looking at the number of legs per body segment.
Millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while centipedes have a single pair of legs per body segment.
Millipedes protect their eggs from predators by using a nest of hard soil.
Millipedes are not poisonous.
They lack the pair of fangs containing a poison gland that centipedes have.
The third class, Symphyla, contains 200 species.
Symphylans resemble centipedes but are smaller and translucent.
