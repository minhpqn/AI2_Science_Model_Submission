Diagram illustrating heat transfer by radiation
Thermal radiation is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred.
The other two ways are conduction and convection, both of which need matter to transfer energy.
Radiation is the only way of transferring thermal energy that doesn’t require matter.
To learn more about thermal radiation, watch “Radiation” at the URL below.
Sources of Thermal Radiation
You might be surprised to learn that everything radiates thermal energy, not just really hot things such as the sun or a fire.
For example, when it’s cold outside, a heated home radiates some of its thermal energy into the outdoor environment.
A home that is poorly insulated radiates more energy than a home that is well insulated.
Special cameras can be used to detect radiated heat.
In the Figure below , you can see an image created by one of these cameras.
The areas that are yellow are the areas where the greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the home.
Even people radiate thermal energy.
In fact, when a room is full of people, it may feel noticeably warmer because of all the thermal energy the people radiate!

Q:
Where is thermal radiation radiating from the home in the picture?
A:
The greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the window on the upper left.
A lot of thermal energy is also radiating from the edges of the windows and door.
