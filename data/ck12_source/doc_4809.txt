Proteins also make up the majority of muscle tissues.
Many proteins are enzymes that speed up chemical reactions in cells.
Enzymes interact with the substrates (reactants) of a biochemical reaction, helping the reaction proceed at a much faster rate.
Other proteins are antibodies that protect you from pathogens.
Antibodies bond to foreign substances in the body and target them for destruction.
Still other proteins help carry messages or materials in and out of cells (transport proteins) or around the body.
For example, the blood protein hemoglobin (see Figure below ) bonds with oxygen and carries it from the lungs to cells throughout the body.

This model represents the protein hemoglobin.
The red parts of the molecule contain iron.
The iron binds with oxygen molecules.

One of the most important traits of proteins, allowing them to carry out these functions, is their ability to bond with other molecules.
They can bond with other molecules very specifically and tightly.
This ability, in turn, is due to the complex and highly specific structure of protein molecules.
The structure-function relationship of proteins is an important principle of biology.
A slight difference in the structure of a protein can lead to a difference in the function of that protein, and this can have devastating effects on the cell or organism.
Proteins and Diet
Proteins in the diet are necessary for life.
