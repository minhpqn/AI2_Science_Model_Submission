A compound is any combination of two or more different elements.
A compound has different properties from the elements that it contains.
Elements and combinations of elements (compounds) make up all the many types of matter in the Universe.
A chemical reaction is a process that breaks or forms the bonds between atoms of molecules and compounds.
For example, two hydrogens and one oxygen bind together to form water, H 2 O.
The molecules that come together to start a chemical reaction are the reactants .
So hydrogen and oxygen are the reactants.
The product is the end result of a reaction.
In this example, water is the product.
Atoms also come together to form compounds much larger than water.
It is some of these large compounds that come together to form the basis of the cell.
So essentially, your cells are made out of compounds, which are made out of atoms.
Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances with different properties.
Elements have been organized by their properties to form the periodic table.
Two or more atoms can combine to form a molecule.
Molecules consisting of more than one element are called compounds.
Reactants can combine through chemical reactions to form products.
