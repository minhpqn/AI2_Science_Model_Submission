A:
Unlike some other metals, transition metals have the properties that define the metals class.
They are excellent conductors of electricity, for example, and they also have luster, malleability, and ductility.
You can read more about these properties of transition metals below.
Properties of Transition Metals
Transition metals are superior conductors of heat as well as electricity.
They are malleable, which means they can be shaped into sheets, and ductile, which means they can be shaped into wires.
They have high melting and boiling points, and all are solids at room temperature, except for mercury (Hg), which is a liquid.
Transition metals are also high in density and very hard.
Most of them are white or silvery in color, and they are generally lustrous, or shiny.
The compounds that transition metals form with other elements are often very colorful.
You can see several examples in the Figure below .

Some properties of transition metals set them apart from other metals.
Compared with the alkali metals in group 1 and the alkaline Earth metals in group 2, the transition metals are much less reactive.
They don’t react quickly with water or oxygen, which explains why they resist corrosion.
Other properties of the transition metals are unique.
They are the only elements that may use electrons in the next to highest—as well as the highest—energy level as valence electrons.
Valence electrons are the electrons that form bonds with other elements in compounds and that generally determine the properties of elements.
Transition metals are unusual in having very similar properties even with different numbers of valence electrons.
