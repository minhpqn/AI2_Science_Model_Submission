Why does not having a backbone make things so complex?
Invertebrates could be described as simple animals.
And though some are very simple, the vastness of the invertebrate species makes this group of animals anything but simple.
Distinguish between invertebrates and vertebrates.
List invertebrate phyla, and give examples of each.
How are these jellyfish like an insect?
Jellyfish and insects don't seem to have much in common.
They look much different.
They live in very different environments.
But both of these animals are classified as invertebrates.
What Are Invertebrates?
Animals are often identified as being either invertebrates or vertebrates.
These are terms based on the skeletons of the animals.
Vertebrates have a backbone made of bone or cartilage ( cartilage is a flexible supportive tissue.
You have cartilage in your ear lobes.).
Invertebrates , on the other hand, have no backbone ( Figure below ).
Invertebrates live just about anywhere.
There are so many invertebrates on this planet that it is impossible to count them all.
There are probably billions of billions of invertebrates.
They come in many shapes and sizes, live practically anywhere and provide many services that are vital for the survival of other organisms, including us.
