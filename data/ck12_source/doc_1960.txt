be organic.
The organic molecules needed are amino acids.
have a metabolism.
be capable of replication (be able to reproduce).
Amino acids are molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
These molecules are called the building blocks of life because they create proteins.
Proteins are complex organic molecules that make up cells.
They are the most abundant class of biological molecules.
Learning About the Origin of Life
To look for information regarding the origin of life, scientists:
perform experiments to recreate the environmental conditions found at that time.
study the living creatures that make their homes in extreme environments.
These environments are most like Earthâ€™s early days.
seek traces of life left by ancient microorganisms, also called microbes ( Figure below ).
These include microscopic features or chemistry left by life.
It is very difficult to distinguish these from non-biological features.
Pictures of microbes
How can we tell where these microbes have been?
For something to be alive it must be organic, have a metabolism, and be capable of replication.
Amino acids create proteins.
