Gases with low molar masses such as hydrogen and helium can be used to float balloons
What makes it float?
Helium has long been used in balloons and blimps.
Since it is much less dense than air, it will float above the ground.
We can buy small balloons filled with helium at stores, but large ones (such as the balloon seen above) are much more expensive and take up a lot more helium.
Calculating Molar Mass and Density of a Gas
A chemical reaction, which produces a gas, is performed.
The produced gas is then collected and its mass and volume are determined.
The molar mass of the unknown gas can be found using the ideal gas law, provided the temperature and pressure of the gas are also known.
Sample Problem:
Molar Mass and the Ideal Gas Law
A certain reaction occurs, producing an oxide of nitrogen as a gas.
The gas has a mass of 1.211 g and occupies a volume of 677 mL.
The temperature in the laboratory is 23Â°C and the air pressure is 0.987 atm.
Calculate the molar mass of the gas and deduce its formula.
Assume the gas is ideal.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem .
V = 677 \text{ ml} = 0.677 \text{ L}
T= 23^\circ \text{C}=296 \text{ K}
