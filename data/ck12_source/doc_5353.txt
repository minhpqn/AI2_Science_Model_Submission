Overview of Transcription.
Transcription uses the sequence of bases in a strand of DNA to make a complementary strand of mRNA.
Triplets are groups of three successive nucleotide bases in DNA.
Codons are complementary groups of bases in mRNA.
Every triplet, or codon, encodes for a unique amino acid.
In eukaryotes, preinitiation of transcription is a step that determines if transcription will proceed.
This step is involved in the regulation of gene expression, and will be further discussed in those concepts.
The process is also highly regulated in prokaryotic cells, but is a much less complicated process than that in eukaryotic cells.
Briefly, during preinitiation, RNA polymerase binds to a promoter sequence in the presence of specific transcription factors.
RNA polymerase II , and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA.
The TATA box is a highly characterized core promoter sequence found in most eukaryotic promoters.
The TATA box is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID).
Only after this factor and a number of other factors bind to this complex can RNA polymerase complete the preinitiation complex and initiate transcription.
The rate of transcription is modulated by additional activators and repressors.
The complete preinitiation complex contains:
the core promoter sequence
various transcription factors
activators and repressors.
RNA polymerase, which is also known as DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is an enzyme that produces RNA using a DNA template.
