\text{moles solute} = M \times L
We can then set the moles of acid equal to the moles of base.
M_A \times V_A=M_B \times V_B
M_A  is the molarity of the acid, while  M_B is the molarity of the base.  V_A and  V_B are the volumes of the acid and base, respectively.
Suppose that a titration is performed and 20.70 mL of 0.500 M NaOH is required to reach the end point when titrated against 15.00 mL of HCl of unknown concentration.
The above equation can be used to solve for the molarity of the acid.
M_A=\frac{M_B \times V_B}{V_A}=\frac{0.500 \ \text{M} \times 20.70 \ \text{mL}}{15.00 \ \text{mL}}=0.690 \ \text{M}
The higher molarity of the acid compared to the base in this case means that a smaller volume of the acid is required to reach the equivalence point.
The above equation works only for neutralizations in which there is a 1:1 ratio between the acid and the base.
The sample problem below demonstrates the technique to solve a titration problem for a titration of sulfuric acid with sodium hydroxide.
Sample Problem:
Titration
In a titration of sulfuric acid against sodium hydroxide, 32.20 mL of 0.250 M NaOH is required to neutralize 26.60 mL of H 2 SO 4 .
Calculate the molarity of the sulfuric acid.
Step 1:
List the known values and plan the problem.
molarity NaOH = 0.250 M
volume NaOH = 32.20 mL
volume H 2 SO 4 = 26.60 mL
molarity H 2 SO 4 = ?
