Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
& \text{molecular formula of sulfate ion} = \text{SO}{_4}^{2-} \\& \text{1 S atom} = 6 \ \text{valence electrons} \\& \text{4 O atoms} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \ \text{valence electrons} \\& \text{add 2 electrons for the} \ 2 - \ \text{charge of the ion} \\& \text{total of 32 valence electrons}
The less electronegative sulfur atom is the central atom in the structure.  Place the oxygen atoms around the sulfur atom, each with a single covalent bond.  Distribute lone pairs to each oxygen atom in order to satisfy the octet rule.  Count the total number of atoms.  If there are too many electrons in the structure, make multiple bonds between the S and O.
Step 2:
Solve.
Structure of the sulfate ion
The sulfate ion.
Step 3:  Think about your result.
The Lewis structure for the sulfate ion consists of a central sulfur atom with four single bonds to oxygen atoms.  This yields the expected total of 32 electrons.  Since the sulfur atom started with six valence electrons, two of the S-O bonds are coordinate covalent.
Lewis structures for polyatomic ions follow the same rules as those for other covalent compounds.
