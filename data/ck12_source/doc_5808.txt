Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds, or lakes.
Protists can be unicellular (single-celled) or multicellular (many-celled).
Seaweed and kelp are examples of multicellular, plant-like protists.
Kelp can be as large as trees and form a "forest" in the ocean ( Figure below
Giant kelp is a type of multicellular, plant-like protist
Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) is a type of multicellular, plant-like protist.
Plant-like protists are essential to the ecosystem.
They are the base of the marine food chain, and they produce oxygen through photosynthesis for animals to breathe.
They are classified into a number of basic groups ( Table below ).
