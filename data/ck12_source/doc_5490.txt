One would think that would be beneficial to society.
So, can biotechnology be used to do just that?
Scientists are working on modifying proteins in foods to increase their nutritional qualities.
Also, proteins in legumes and cereals may be transformed to provide all the amino acids needed by human beings for a balanced diet.
Improved Taste, Texture or Appearance of Food
Have you ever gone to the grocery store, bought some fruit and never gotten around to eating it?
Maybe you havenâ€™t, but maybe your parents have.
Modern biotechnology can be used to slow down the process of spoilage so that fruit can ripen longer on the plant and then be transported to the consumer with a still reasonable shelf life.
This is extremely important in parts of the world where time from harvest to the consumer may be longer than in other areas.
In addition to improving the taste, texture and appearance of fruit, it will also extend the usable life of the fruit.
As the world population grows and grows, this may become a fairly important issue.
Extending the life of fruit can expand the market for farmers in developing countries due to the reduction in spoilage.
This has successfully been demonstrated with the tomato.
The first genetically modified food product was a tomato which was transformed to delay its ripening.
Researchers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam are currently working on developing other delayed ripening fruits, such as the papaya.
Reduced Dependence on Fertilizers, Pesticides and Other Agrochemicals
There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture.
Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals.
For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin .
But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical.
