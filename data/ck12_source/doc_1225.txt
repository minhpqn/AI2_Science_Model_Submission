The rock cycle describes each of the main types of rocks, how they form, and how they change.
The figure below shows how the three main rock types are related to each other ( Figure below ).
The arrows within the circle show how one type of rock may change to rock of another type.
These are the processes that change one rock type to another rock type.

Processes of the Rock Cycle
There are three main processes that can change rock:
Cooling and crystallization.
Deep within the Earth, temperatures can get hot enough to create magma.
As magma cools, crystals grow, forming an igneous rock.
The crystals grow larger if the magma cools slowly, as it does if it remains deep within the Earth.
If the magma cools quickly, the crystals will be very small.
When crystals form from magma it is called crystallization .
Weathering and erosion.
Water, wind, ice, and even plants and animals all act to wear down rocks.
Over time they can break larger rocks into sediments.
Rocks break down by the process called weathering .
Moving water, wind, and glaciers then carry these pieces from one place to another.
This is called erosion .
