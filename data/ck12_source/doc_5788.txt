The largest electronegativity (3.98) is assigned to fluorine and all other electronegativities measurements are on a relative scale.
Since metals have few valence electrons, they tend to increase their stability by losing electrons to become cations.
Consequently, the electronegativities of metals are generally low.
Nonmetals have more valence electrons and increase their stability by gaining electrons to become anions.
The electronegativities of nonmetals are generally high.
Electronegativities generally increase from left to right across a period.
This is due to an increase in nuclear charge.
Alkali metals have the lowest electronegativities, while halogens have the highest.
Because most noble gases do not form compounds, they do not have electronegativities.
Note that there is little variation among the transition metals.
Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size.
Of the main group elements, fluorine has the highest electronegativity (EN = 4.0) and cesium the lowest (EN = 0.79).
This indicates that fluorine has a high tendency to gain electrons from other elements with lower electronegativities.
We can use these values to predict what happens when certain elements combine.

When the difference between electronegativities is greater than ~1.7, then a complete exchange of electrons occurs.
Typically this exchange is between a metal and a nonmetal.
For instance, sodium and chlorine will typically combine to form a new compound and each ion becomes isoelectronic with its nearest noble gas.
When we compare the EN values, we see that the electronegativity for Na is 0.93 and the value for Cl is 3.2.
