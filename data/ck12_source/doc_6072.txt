Do amorphous solids have sharp melting points?
What word is sometimes used to refer to glass?
amorphous:
A solid that lacks an ordered internal structure.
supercooled:
A liquid at a temperature lower than its freezing point that has not solidified.
Heating and Cooling Curves
List the changes of state.
Relate the change of state to a change in temperature.
Steam provides a large amount of power because it is vaporized water
How is it that steamboats contain so much power?
During the time of Mark Twain (real name Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835-1910), the steamboat was a major means of transportation on the rivers and lakes of the United States.
Twain himself was a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River for a period of time and took his pen name from the measurement of water depth (twelve feet, which was a safe depth for the boats).
The boats got their power from steam – liquid water converted to a gas at high temperatures.
The steam would push the pistons of the engine, causing the paddle wheels to turn and propel the boat.
Imagine that you have a block of ice that is at a temperature of -30°C, well below its melting point.
The ice is in a closed container.
As heat is steadily added to the ice block, the water molecules will begin to vibrate faster and faster as they absorb kinetic energy.
Eventually, when the ice has warmed to 0°C, the added energy will start to break apart the hydrogen bonding that keeps the water molecules in place when it is in the solid form.
As the ice melts, its temperature does not rise.
