Polygenic inheritance often results in a bell shaped curve when you analyze the population ( Figure below ).
That means that most people fall in the middle of the phenotypic range, such as average height, while very few people are at the extremes, such as very tall or very short.
At one end of the curve will be individuals who are recessive for all the alleles (for example, aabbcc ); at the other end will be individuals who are dominant for all the alleles (for example, AABBCC ).
Through the middle of the curve will be individuals who have a combination of dominant and recessive alleles (for example, AaBbCc or AaBBcc ).
Polygenic traits result in a distribution that resembles a bell-shaped curve
Polygenic traits tend to result in a distribution that resembles a bell-shaped curve, with few at the extremes and most in the middle.
There may be 4 or 6 or more alleles involved in the phenotype.
At the left extreme, individuals are completely dominant for all alleles, and at the right extreme, individuals are completely recessive for all alleles.
Individuals in the middle have various combinations of recessive and dominant alleles.
In polygenic inheritance, a trait is controlled by more than one gene.
Examples of polygenic inheritance include height or skin color.
