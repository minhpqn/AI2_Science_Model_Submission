Reservoirs for water include oceans, glaciers, ponds, or even the atmosphere.
A water molecule may pass through a reservoir very quickly or may remain for much longer.
The amount of time a molecule stays in a reservoir is known as its residence time .
The residence time of water in the ocean is 3,200 years.
Of course, not every molecule stays that long.
That number is an average for all molecules.
Of Earth's water, 97% is in the oceans.
Of the remaining 3%, much is trapped in ice and glaciers.
A substance is stored in a reservoir.
The amount of time it stays in that reservoir is its residence time.
