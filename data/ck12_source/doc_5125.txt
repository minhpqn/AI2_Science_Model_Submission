A cell is the simplest unit of structure and function of all living organisms.
From the smallest bacteria to the largest whale, all life is made of at least one cell.
You are made of trillions of cells.
Cells of many different types of cells.
Nerve cells, skin cells, muscle cells, blood cells and many more.
These cells obviously have many different functions, yet they all develop from the first cell that makes you, the zygote.
So do they all have the same DNA?
Of course they do.
Are all the cells in your body genetically identical?
Of course they are.
How does the first cell of an organism know to become two cells, then four cells, and so on?
What tells these cells what to do?
The answers to those questions are more complicated than a simple yes or no.
Your body produces about 25 million genetically identical cells every second.
These new cells are formed when older cells divide, a process called cell division or cell reproduction.
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells, as seen in the Figure below .
Eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells complete this division process by a number of different mechanisms.
In eukaryotic cells, cell division is the final step in the life of a cell, otherwise known as the cell cycle .
The cell cycle is a repeating series of events, during which the eukaryotic cell carries out its necessary functions, including metabolism, cellular growth, and division, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.
To produce two genetically identical daughter cells, the chromosomes need to replicate, a process called DNA replication, and the nucleus and cytoplasm need to divide, two processes termed mitosis and cytokinesis , respectively.
