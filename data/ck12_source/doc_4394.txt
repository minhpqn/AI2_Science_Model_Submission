Eggs that are laid on the ground may be camouflaged to look like their surroundings (also shown in Figure below ).
Otherwise, eggs are usually white or pastel colors such as pale blue or pink.

A weaver bird uses grasses to weave an elaborate nest (left).
The eggs of a ground-nesting gull are camouflaged to blend in with the nesting materials (right).
After birds lay their eggs, they generally keep the eggs warm with their body heat while the embryos inside continue to develop.
This is called incubation, or brooding .
In most species, parents stay together for at least the length of the breeding season.
In some species, they stay together for life.
By staying together, the males as well as females can incubate the eggs and later care for the hatchlings .
Birds are the only nonhuman vertebrates with this level of male parental involvement.

Ground-nesting birds, such as ducks and chickens, have hatchlings that are able to run around and feed themselves almost as soon as they break through the eggshell.
Being on the ground makes them vulnerable to predators, so they need to be relatively mature when they hatch in order to escape.
In contrast, birds that nest off the ground—in trees, bushes, or buildings—have hatchlings that are naked and helpless.
The parents must protect and feed the immature offspring for weeks or even months.
However, this gives the offspring more time to learn from the parents before they leave the nest and go out on their own.
In birds, 90% to 95% of species are monogamous , meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one mate dies.
