Where does all the bear's energy come from?
Bears get their energy from their food.
Brown bears eat a varied diet, from nuts and berries to fish and other animals.
When bears eat a berry, they are obtaining energy that the plant originally captured from the sun.
Even when a bear eats another animal, the energy in that animal ultimately came from eating a producer that captured the sun's energy.
Energy is the ability to do work.
In organisms, this work can be physical work, like walking or jumping, or it can be the work used to carry out the chemical processes in their cells.
Every biochemical reaction that occurs in an organism's cells needs energy.
All organisms need a constant supply of energy to stay alive.
