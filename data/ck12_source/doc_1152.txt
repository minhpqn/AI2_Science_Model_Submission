A few of these methods will be described in this concept.
Learning About Earth’s Interior
If someone told you to figure out what is inside Earth, what would you do?
How could you figure out what is inside our planet?
How do scientists figure it out?
Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior.
Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus.
These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ).
Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials.
They change speed when they go from one type of material to another.
This causes them to bend.
Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases.
They just stop.
Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.
The properties of seismic waves allow scientists to understand the composition of Earth's interior
The properties of seismic waves allow scientists to understand the composition of Earth's interior.
Scientists study meteorites to learn about Earth’s interior.
Meteorites formed in the early solar system.
These objects represent early solar system materials ( Figure below ).
Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel.
