Data on the reaction mechanism shows us that the reaction occurs in two steps:
Step 1: 2 \text{NO}(g) \rightarrow \text{N}_2 \text{O}_2(g)
Step 2: \text{N}_2 \text{O}_2(g)+ \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{NO}_2(g)
So we see that each elementary step is bimolecular and not termolecular.
Notice that the colliding molecules may be the same (as in step 1 above) or different (as in step 2 above).
Another reaction involves the conversion of ozone (O 3 ) to oxygen (O 2 ) with ultraviolet light.
The two elementary steps are as follows:
& \text{O}_3 + \text{ultraviolet light} \rightarrow \text{O}_2+ {\text{O} \cdot} (\text{free radical}) \ \text{slow reaction} \\& {\text{O} \cdot} + \text{O}_3 \rightarrow 2 \text{O}_2 \ \text{fast reaction}
The first step is unimolecular (one molecule of ozone reacts) and the second step is bimolecular (one ozone free radical and one ozone molecule react together).
Molecularity is defined and examples are given.

molecularity:
The number of molecules reacting in an elementary step.
Define rate-determining step.
Like in an airport, the rate of a line is constricted by the slowest step
Waiting in line
Airline travel can be very frustrating.
