For more than 100 years, south San Francisco Bay has been a center for industrial salt production.
Now federal and state biologists are working to restore the ponds to healthy wetlands for fish and other wildlife.
Salt marshes are rich habitats that provide shelter and food for many species, some of which are endangered or threatened.

San Francisco Bay:
A Unique Estuary
An estuary is a partly enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the ocean.
Estuaries can be thought of as the most biologically productive regions on Earth, with very high biodiversity.
Estuaries are zones where land and sea come together, and where fresh and salt water meet.
The San Francisco Bay is one of the great estuaries of the world.

This is particularly evident in the sediment on the floors of rivers, streams, lakes and oceans.
The released toxins are absorbed by fish, affecting the ecological food chain as well as the fish we eat.
Can this issue be lessened?
