For example, biotechnology may be used to create crops that resist insect pests or yield more food, or to create new treatments for human diseases.

What does biotechnology have to do with me?
Is discussed in the following video:  (10:01).
Biotechnology uses a variety of techniques to achieve its aims.
Two commonly used techniques are gene cloning and the polymerase chain reaction.
Gene cloning is the process of isolating and making copies of a gene.
This is useful for many purposes.
For example, gene cloning might be used to isolate and make copies of a normal gene for gene therapy.
Gene cloning involves four steps: isolation, ligation, transformation, and selection.
You can watch an interactive animation about gene cloning at this link:
In isolation, an enzyme (called a restriction enzyme) is used to break DNA at a specific base sequence.
This is done to isolate a gene.
During ligation , the enzyme DNA ligase combines the isolated gene with plasmid DNA from bacteria. (A plasmid is circular DNA that is not part of a chromosome and can replicate independently.) Ligation is illustrated in Figure below .
The DNA that results is called recombinant DNA .
In transformation , the recombinant DNA is inserted into a living cell, usually a bacterial cell.
Changing an organism in this way is also called genetic engineering .
Selection involves growing transformed bacteria to make sure they have the recombinant DNA.
This is a necessary step because transformation is not always successful.
