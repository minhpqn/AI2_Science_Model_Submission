Since both waves are lifting the medium, the combined wave crest will be twice as high as the original crests.
Nearby, a wave trough will overlap another wave trough and the new trough will be twice as deep as the original.
This is called  constructive interference  because the resultant wave is larger than the original waves.
Within the interference pattern, the amplitude will be twice the original amplitude.
Once the waves pass through each other and are alone again, their amplitudes return to their original values.
In other parts of the wave pattern, crests from one wave will overlap troughs from another wave.
When the two waves have the same amplitude, this interaction causes them to cancel each other out.
Instead of a crest or a trough, there is nothing.
When this cancellation occurs, it is called  destructive interference.
Interference pattern of raindrops in a pond .
It is easy to see how waves emanating from multiple sources, such as drops of rainwater in still water, create interference patterns.
But a single source of waves can create interference patterns with itself as a result of diffraction.
The Double Slit Experiment
A similar situation to the raindrops above occurs when straight waves strike a barrier containing two slits.
These waves are cut off everywhere except for where the waves that pass through the two slits.
The medium in the slits again acts as a point source to produce circular waves on the far side of the barrier.
Double slit interference experiment
As long as these two circular waves have the same wavelength, they interfere constructively and destructively in a specific pattern.
This pattern is called the  wave interference pattern  and is characterized by light and dark bands.
The light bands are a result of constructive interference, and the dark bands occur because of destructive interference.
