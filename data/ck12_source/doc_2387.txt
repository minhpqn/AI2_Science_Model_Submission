Bar graphs are especially useful for comparing values for different things, such as the average numbers of tornadoes for different cities.
Therefore, a bar graph is a good choice for displaying the data in the Table above .
The bar graph below shows one way that these data could be presented.
Q:
What do the two axes of this bar graph represent?
A:
The x-axis represents cities, and the y-axis represents average numbers of tornadoes.
Q:
Could you switch what the axes represent?
If so, how would the bar graph look?
A:
Yes; the x-axis could represent average numbers of tornadoes, and the y-axis could represent cities.
The bars of the graph would be horizontal instead of vertical.
The data in Table below shows the percent of all U.S. tornadoes by tornado strength for the years 1986 to 1995.
In this table, tornadoes are rated on a scale called the F scale.
