The atmosphere and oceans that we see today evolved over time.
The gases came from volcanic eruptions and from comets.
Formation of the Atmosphere and Oceans
An atmosphere is the gases that surround a planet.
The early Earth had no atmosphere.
Conditions were so hot that gases were not stable.
Earth's First Atmosphere
Earth’s first atmosphere was different from the current one.
The gases came from two sources.
Volcanoes spewed gases into the air.
Comets carried in ices from outer space.
These ices warmed and became gases.
Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water vapor, or water in gas form, were in the first atmosphere ( Figure below ).
Take a look at the list of gases.
What's missing?
The early atmosphere had almost no oxygen.
Gases from Earth’s interior came through volcanoes and into the atmosphere
Gases from Earth’s interior came through volcanoes and into the atmosphere.
The Early Oceans
Earth’s atmosphere slowly cooled.
