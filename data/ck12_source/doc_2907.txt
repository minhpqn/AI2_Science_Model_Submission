In peas, purple flowers are dominant to white.
If one of these purple flowers is crossed with a white flower, all the offspring will have purple flowers.
This law explains what Mendel had seen in the F1 generation when a tall plant was crossed with a short plant.
The two heredity factors in this case were the short and tall factors.
Each individual in the F1 would have one of each factor, and as the tall factor is dominant to the short factor (the recessive factor), all the plants appeared tall.
In describing genetic crosses, letters are used.
The dominant factor is represented with a capital letter ( T for tall) while the recessive factor is represented by a lowercase letter ( t ).
For the T and t factors, three combinations are possible:
TT , Tt , and tt .
TT plants will be tall, while plants with tt will be short.
Since T is dominant to t , plants that are Tt will be tall because the dominant factor masks the recessive factor.
In this example, we are crossing a TT tall plant with a tt short plant.
As each parent gives one factor to the F1 generation, all of the F1 generation will be Tt tall plants.
When the F1 generation ( Tt ) is allowed to self-pollinate, each parent will give one factor ( T or t ) to the F2 generation.
So the F2 offspring will have four possible combinations of factors:
TT , Tt , tT , or tt .
According to the laws of probability, 25% of the offspring would be tt , so they would appear short.
And 75% would have at least one T factor and would be tall.
One hereditary factor is dominant to the other.
The dominant trait masks the recessive factor, so that when both factors are present, only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable.
