Identify and describe key developments in human evolution.
What is a "cave man"?
What if you were to wake up with a group of Neanderthals?
They were close relatives to modern humans.
Still you might find them to be a bit different from your usual friends.
Humans evolved during the later Cenozoic.
New fossil discoveries continue to alter the details of what we know about human evolution.
The major evolutionary events are well understood though.
Humans evolved from primates , a group of mammals that includes lemurs, monkeys and apes.
Humans are part of the apes, but we did not evolve from apes , which also include chimpanzees and gorillas.
Apes and humans have a primate common ancestor.
About 5 to 7 million years ago, chimpanzees (our closest living relatives) and humans shared their last common ancestor.
Animals of the genus, Ardipithecus lived roughly 4 to 6 million years ago.
These animals had brains roughly the size of a female chimp.
Although they lived in trees, they were bipedal.
That is, they could stand on two feet.
What are the advantages to being bipedal?
An organism that can stand up can see farther.
This is important if you live in a grassland.
A bipedal organism uses its hands and arms for hunting.
