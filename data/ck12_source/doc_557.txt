T Cell Response
There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells.
Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells ( Figure below ).
When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons.
The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell.
This causes the cell to burst open.
Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed.
A killer T cell recognizes a body cell infected with a virus and causes it to burst
In this diagram, a killer T cell recognizes a body cell infected with a virus.
After the killer T cell makes contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons that cause the infected cell to burst.
This kills both the infected cell and the viruses inside it.
Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells.
But they are still necessary for an immune response.
They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes.
The chemicals released by helper T cells “switch on” both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens.
B cells produce antibodies against pathogens in the blood and lymph.
Killer T cells destroy body cells infected with pathogens.
