If you go there you will hear the history of the area, complete with dates.
How do archeologists know when the people lived here?
How do they know the ages of the structures there?
Tree ring dating is extremely useful for finding the age of ancient structures.
Tree Ring Dating
Cut into a tree and you can see its rings.
In some locations, the summer growth band is light-colored and the winter band is dark.
Each light-dark band represents one year.
You can tell how long the tree lived by counting the number of tree rings ( Figure below ).
Age dating by tree rings is called dendrochronology .

You can tell other things from tree rings too.
In a good year a tree will produce a wide ring.
A summer drought will produce a smaller ring.
These variations will appear in all trees in a region.
The same pattern can be found in all the trees in the area.
This pattern helps scientist to identify a particular time period.
Scientists have records of tree rings going back over the past 2,000 years.
By matching up patterns they can tell when a tree (or a piece of wood from one) lived.
