As a result, some hydrocarbons are gases at room temperature, while others are liquids or solids.
Hydrocarbons are generally nonpolar, which means that their molecules do not have oppositely charged sides.
Therefore, they do not dissolve in water, which is a polar compound.
In fact, hydrocarbons tend to repel water.
That’s why they are used in floor wax and similar products.
Classes of Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons are placed in two different classes: saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons.
This classification is based on the number of bonds between carbon atoms.
Saturated hydrocarbons have only single bonds between carbon atoms, so the carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
In other words, they are saturated with hydrogen atoms.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms, so the carbon atoms are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
In other words, they are unsaturated with hydrogen atoms.

Uses of Hydrocarbons
It is hard to overstate the importance of hydrocarbons to modern life.
Hydrocarbons have even been called the “driving force of western civilization.” You saw some ways they are used in the opening image.
Several other ways are pictured in the Figure below .
The most important use of hydrocarbons is for fuel.
Gasoline, natural gas, fuel oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, coal, kerosene, and propane are just some of the commonly used hydrocarbon fuels.
