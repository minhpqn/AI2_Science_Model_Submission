The picture shows a single girl and her mirror image.
How Mirrors Form Images
A mirror is typically made of glass with a shiny metal backing that reflects all the light that strikes it.
When a mirror reflects light, it forms an image.
An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflection or refraction.
Mirrors may have flat or curved surfaces.
The shape of a mirror’s surface determines the type of image it forms.
For example, some mirrors form real images, and other mirrors form virtual images.
What’s the difference between real and virtual images?
A real image forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays actually meet.
It is a true image that could be projected on a screen.
A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror.
Of course, reflected rays don’t actually go through the mirror to the other side, so a virtual image doesn’t really exist.
It just appears to exist to the human brain.
