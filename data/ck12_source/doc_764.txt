What is a common mistake made by homeowners when replacing burned fuses?
As a wire conductor increases in diameter, the resistance
stays the same
The purpose of a fuse in an electrical circuit is to
add another resistor
increase the circuit voltage
limit the maximum current in the circuit
none of these
What is the purpose of a circuit breaker in an electrical circuit?
In some wire-in-glass fuses, the wire is not the same diameter all the way across the fuse.
Many such fuses have one part of the wire that is considerably more narrow than the remainder of the wire.
What is the purpose of this narrowing of the fuse wire?
short circuit:
A device in a circuit is said to be short-circuited if it is by-passed by a conductor of nearly zero resistance so that the voltage across the device drops to almost zero and the current in the by-pass circuit becomes huge.
electrical fuse:
A safety device that protects an electric circuit from excessive current, consisting of or containing a metal element that melts when current exceeds a specific amperage, thereby opening the circuit.
circuit breaker:
A reusable device used to interrupt an electrical circuit if the current flow exceeds a chosen level and becomes dangerous.
surge protector:
A device used to eliminate sudden surges or spikes of electrical power in a circuit.
