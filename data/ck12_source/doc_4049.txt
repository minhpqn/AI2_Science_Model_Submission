Differences in the types of chlorophyll in the four types of algae also support the hypothesized evolutionary relationships.

Reproduction of Algae
Algae have varied life cycles.
Two examples are shown in Figure below .
Both cycles include phases of asexual reproduction (haploid, n ) and sexual reproduction (diploid, 2n ).
Why go to so much trouble to reproduce?
Asexual reproduction is fast, but it doesnâ€™t create new genetic variation.
Sexual reproduction is more complicated and risky, but it creates new gene combinations.
Each strategy may work better under different conditions.
Rapid population growth (asexual reproduction) is adaptive when conditions are favorable.
Genetic variation (sexual reproduction) helps ensure that some organisms will survive if the environment changes.
Life cycles of algae
Life Cycles of Algae:
Zygotic Meiosis (A), Gametic Meiosis (B) and Sporic Meiosis (C).
In life cycle A (left), diploid (2n) zygotes result from fertilization and then undergo meiosis to produce haploid (n) gametes.
The gametes undergo mitosis and produce many additional copies of themselves.
How are life cycles B and C different from life cycle A?
