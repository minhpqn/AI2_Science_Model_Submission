Describe the consequences of using wind energy.
Is this what a wind farm looks like?
It's a strange sight.
You're driving up the road in Southern California, and sprouting from the ground is a pack of windmills!
Windmills are becoming more common on the eastern side of the mountains.
This is because the wind comes off the Pacific Ocean and funnels through mountain passes.
The wind is strong and California wants to take advantage of it.

Winds are funneled through passes in mountain ranges.
Altamont Pass in California is the site of many wind turbines.
The energy from the Sun creates wind ( Figure above ).
Wind energy moves by convection .
The Sun heats some locations more than others.
Warm air rises, so other air rushes in to fill the hole left by the rising air.
This horizontal movement of air is called wind.
Wind as a Resource
Wind power uses moving air as a source of energy.
Some types of wind power have been around for a long time.
People have used windmills to grind grain and pump water for hundreds of years.
Sailing ships have depended on wind for millennia.
