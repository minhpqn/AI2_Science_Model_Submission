You can see what Aristotle looked like in the Figure below .
Prior to Aristotle, other philosophers believed that they could find the truth about the natural world by inward reflection—in other words, just by thinking about it.
Aristotle, in contrast, thought that truth about the natural world could come only from observations of nature and inductive reasoning.
He argued that knowledge of nature must be based on evidence and logic.
This idea is called empiricism, and it is the basis of science today.

Aristotle introduced the idea of empiricism around 350 BCE.
It is a hallmark of modern science.
Introducing the Scientific Method
In the first 1000 years CE, Europe went through a period called the Dark Ages.
Science and learning in general were all but abandoned.
However, in other parts of the world science flourished.
During this period, some of the most important contributions to science were made by Persian scholars.
For example, during the 700s CE, a Persian scientist named Geber introduced the scientific method and experimentation in chemistry.
His ideas and methods were later adopted by European chemists.
Today, Geber is known as the “father of chemistry.”
Modern Western Science Emerges
Starting in the mid-1500s, a scientific revolution occurred in Europe.
This was the beginning of modern Western science.
Many scientific advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years.
