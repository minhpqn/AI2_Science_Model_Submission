This was highly adaptive.
Multiple cells could do different jobs.
They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do their job really well.
However, the first invertebrates still lacked tissues.
Sponges represent the first organism at the multicellular stage of invertebrate evolution.
Living cnidarians, such as jellyfish, represent the next stage of invertebrate evolution.
This was the evolution of tissues.
It was the first step in the evolution of organs and organ systems.
At first, invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers.
There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm and an inner cell layer called endoderm.
The two cell layers allowed different types of tissues to form.
Another trait that evolved early on was symmetry .
To understand symmetry, you need to see an animal that lacks symmetry.
A sponge, like the one in Figure below , lacks symmetry.
This means it cannot be divided into two identical halves.
A symmetrical organism, in contrast, can be divided into two identical halves.
Both the coral polyp and the beetle in Figure below have symmetry.

Sponges lack symmetry.
