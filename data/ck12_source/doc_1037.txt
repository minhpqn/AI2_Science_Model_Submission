It is simpler than the phenomenon itself.
A theory explains a phenomenon.
Scientists can use a theory to make predictions.
A theory is constantly tested.
If some data does not agree with the theory, the theory can be revised.
If the theory cannot match the data, it is thrown out.
That being said, sometimes a theory is well-established; it has a lot of evidence to back it up.
A well-established theory is unlikely to be overthrown.
It may just need to be modified a bit.
But science does not prove anything beyond a shadow of a doubt.

Three Essential Theories
The three theories below are essential in Earth science.
Each accounts for an enormous amount of data.
Each is supported by many lines of evidence.
All can be used to make predications.
As new evidence arises, any of these theories may need to be altered.
But none of these three are likely ever to be disproved.
They are accepted by nearly all of the credible scientists in their fields.
