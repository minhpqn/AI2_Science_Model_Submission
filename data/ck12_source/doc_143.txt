The ostrich, with its terrible senses of smell and hearing and the zebra with its poor eyesight, are both able to warn the other when danger is near.
The zebra can smell or hear certain dangers approaching, while the ostrich can see other dangers.
Both are prepared to warn one another at a momentâ€™s notice so they can each flee when necessary.
Baboons and impala have a similar relationship.
Impala are one of the most common prey species for all predators and need to be constantly alert.
Impala have good hearing and eyesight, raising an alarm when danger is near.
Baboons use trees to check for danger and bark an alarm when danger is sensed.
What do the baboons receive?
Male baboons sometimes prey on young impala soon after birth.
So, though both alert others to dangers, sometimes this is not the best of relationships for young impala.
Zebra and wildebeest are found together on the African savanna grazing different parts of the same grass.
The zebra grazes the tougher parts of the plant, saving the softer parts for the wildebeest.
A zebra will move into an area of tall grass before other herbivores and graze the grass down to the area that the wildebeest prefers.

Importance to Humans
We see examples of mammals (other than people!) serving our needs everywhere.
We have pets that are mammals, such as dogs and cats.
Mammals are also used around the world for transport.
For example, horses, donkeys, mules, or camels ( Figure below ) may be the primary means of transport in some parts of the world.
