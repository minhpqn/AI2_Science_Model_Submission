Distinguish between mass and weight.
Understand the relationship between mass and weight due to the acceleration of gravity.
Know how to determine if a number gives mass or weight based on the units.
When astronauts experience weightlessness, their mass remains unchanged
Astronauts in training often fly in the KC-135 training aircraft to experience near-weightlessness.
Three Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronauts—Akihiko Hoshide, Satoshi Furukawa, and Naoko Yamazaki—are shown here during such an exercise.
Though they experience near-weightlessness, we can see that their mass has not changed.
What is the relationship between mass and weight?
Mass and Weight
The mass of an object is defined as the amount of matter in the object.
The amount of mass an object has does not change; a moon rock that has been returned to Earth has the same mass on the Earth’s surface as it had on the moon.
The amount of mass in an object is measured by comparing the object to known masses on an instrument called a balance.
The mass of an object is measured by comparing the object to known masses on a balance
Using the balance shown here, the object would be placed in one pan and known masses would be placed in the other pan until the pans were exactly balanced.
When balanced, the mass of the object would be equal to the sum of the known masses in the other pan.
A balance will work in any location; whether on the moon or on Earth, the moon rock mentioned earlier will have the same mass.
The weight of an object is the force pulling the object downward.
On Earth, this would be the gravitational force of the Earth on the object.
On the moon, this would be the gravitational force of the moon on the object.
The gravitational force of the moon is one-sixth the magnitude of the gravitational force of the Earth; the weight of the moon rock on the moon will be one-sixth the weight of the moon rock on the Earth’s surface.
