Explain how to prevent pollution by hazardous wastes.
What should be done about hazardous waste sites?
Laws now protect lands from contamination.
Many sites were damaged before those laws were passed.
Cleaning up toxic wastes costs a lot of time and money.
Sometimes the company that caused the damage no longer exists.
Sometimes they cannot afford cleanup.
Then it becomes the government's job to clean up the site.
No other organization is big enough to be sure a cleanup happens.
The Superfund Act
Love Canal opened people’s eyes to toxic waste burial.
They realized there must be other “Love Canals” all over the country.
Thousands of contaminated sites were found.
The Superfund Act was passed in 1980.
The law required that money be set aside for cleanup of toxic waste sites.
The law also required safer disposal of hazardous waste in the future.
Love Canal became a Superfund site in 1983.
As a result, several measures were taken to secure the toxic wastes.
The land was capped so that water could not reach the waste.
Toxic material was cleaned from the nearby area.
