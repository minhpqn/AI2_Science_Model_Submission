Properties of Solutions
Describe how solutes affect the properties of solvents in solutions.
Give examples of freezing point depression and boiling point elevation.
Why hasn’t the ocean water in this photo turned to ice?
The water in the glacier on shore is frozen solid, but the water in the ocean is still in a liquid state.
Q:
What is it about ocean water that keeps it from freezing when the temperature falls below the freezing point of pure water?
A:
Ocean water is salty.
How Solutes Affect Solvents
Salt water in the ocean is a solution.
In a solution, one substance, called the solute, dissolves in another substance, called the solvent.
In ocean water, salt is the solute and water is the solvent.
When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent.
In particular, the solute generally lowers the freezing point of the solvent, which is called freezing point depression, and raises the boiling point of the solvent, which is called boiling point elevation.
For example, adding either salt to water lowers the freezing point and raises the boiling point of the water.
To learn the why these effects occur, watch the excellent video at this URL:
Freezing Point Depression
Pure water freezes at 0 °C, but the salt water in the ocean freezes at -2.2 °C because of freezing point depression.
