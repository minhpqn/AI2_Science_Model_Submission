As an object's mass increases, the attraction increases.
As the distance between the objects increases, the attraction decreases.
The strength of gravity depends on the mass of two objects and the distance between them
The strength of the force of gravity between objects A and B depends on the mass of the objects and the distance ( u ) between them.
Isaac Newton first described gravity as the force that causes objects to fall to the ground.
Gravity is also the force that keeps the Moon circling Earth.
Gravity keeps Earth circling the Sun.
Without gravity, these objects would fly off into space ( Figure below ).
The Moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth-Moon system orbits the Sun
The Moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth-Moon system orbits the Sun.
Gravity pulls any object on or near Earth toward the planet's center.
All objects have a gravitational attraction to each other.
This is called gravity.
The attraction is proportional to the mass of the objects.
The attraction is inversely proportional to the distance between the objects.
Gravity keeps the Moon orbiting Earth.
Gravity keeps the planets orbiting the Sun.
