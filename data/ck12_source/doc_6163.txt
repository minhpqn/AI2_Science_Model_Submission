Why does the solubility of a gas decrease as the temperature increases?
Is the solubility of NaCl affected by solvent?
What is the solubility of KNO 3 at 50°C?
solubility:
The amount of a substance that is required to form a saturated solution in a given amount of solvent at a specified temperature.
solubility curve:
A graph of the solubility of substances as a function of temperature.
Describe the process of supersaturation.
The crystallization of a supersaturated substance can generate or absorb heat for hot or cold packs
How does a hot or a cold pack work?
In the picture above, a thermal pack is applied to the back.
Small packs can be used either for heating or cooling, depending on the material used.
A heat pack contains a supersaturated solution of material such as sodium acetate.
The solution is clear until a small metal trigger is activated.
The sodium acetate then crystallizes out of solution and generates heat in the process.

Some solutes, such as sodium acetate, do not recrystallize easily.
Suppose an exactly saturated solution of sodium acetate is prepared at 50°C.
As it cools back to room temperature, no crystals appear in the solution, even though the solubility of sodium acetate is lower at room temperature.
