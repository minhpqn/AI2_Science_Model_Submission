missense mutations :
Point mutation which codes for a different amino acid.
nonsense mutation :
Point mutation which codes for a premature stop codon.
null allele :
A mutant copy of a gene that completely lacks that gene's normal function.
point mutations :
Exchange one nucleotide for another; known as base substitution mutations.
silent mutation :
Point mutation which codes for the same amino acid.
somatic mutation :
A mutation in a body cell, not in a gamete; cannot be transmitted to the next generation.
splice site mutation :
Mutation in the coding region of a gene that alters splicing of the mRNA.
transition :
A purine to purine, or a pyrimidine to pyrimidine change.
transversion :
A purine is replaced by a pyrimidine, or a pyrimidine is replaced by a purine.
Germline mutations can be passed on to descendants; somatic mutations cannot be transmitted to the next generation.
Chromosomal alterations are large changes in the chromosome structure.
