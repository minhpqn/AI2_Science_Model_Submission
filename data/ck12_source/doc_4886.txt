Thin coat of lipids (phospholipids) that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment; also called the cell membrane.
A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a polar head group ( a phosphate group) and two non-polar hydrocarbon tails.
The plasma membrane is a selectively permeable lipid bilayer that contains mostly lipids and proteins.
These lipids and proteins are involved in many cellular processes.
Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.
What Is the Phospholipid Bilayer? at

Describe the structure of a phospholipid.
What are the phospholipid bilayer's problems?
Why can hydrophobic (“water-hating”) molecules easily cross the plasma membrane, while hydrophilic (“water-loving”) molecules cannot?
Describe the composition of the plasma membrane.
Describe the orientation of the phospholipids in the cell membrane.

Membrane Proteins - Advanced
Describe the structures and roles of proteins associated with the cell membrane.
The second main component of plasma membranes are the variety of proteins.
A membrane protein is a protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with the membrane of a cell or an organelle.
Membrane proteins can be put into two groups based on how the protein is associated with the membrane: (1) integral membrane proteins and (2) peripheral membrane proteins.
Integral membrane proteins , also called intrinsic proteins, are permanently embedded within the plasma membrane.
Structurally, the integral proteins contain residues with hydrophobic side chains that penetrate the fatty acyl regions of the phospholipid bilayer, thus anchoring the protein to the membrane.
