The lava flows over a large area and cools.
This creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock.
Lava plateaus may be huge.
The Columbia Plateau covers over 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles).
It makes up parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho ( Figure below ).
Layers of basalt created the Columbia Plateau, which is a lava plateau
Layer upon layer of basalt have created the Columbia Plateau, which covers more than 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles) in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.
New land is created in volcanic eruptions.
The Hawaiian Islands are shield volcanoes.
These volcanoes formed from fluid lava ( Figure below ).
The island grows as lava is added on the coast.
New land may also emerge from lava that erupts from beneath the water.
This is one way that new land is created.

Lava erupts into the Pacific Ocean in Hawaii, creating new land.
Landforms from Magma
Magma that cools underground forms intrusions ( Figure below ).
Usually this magma is very viscous felsic magma.
This magma does not rise easily and so cools slowly underground.
Intrusions become land formations if they are exposed at the surface by uplift and erosion.
