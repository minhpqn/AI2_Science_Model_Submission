Well, bones are a living tissue.
They have a blood supply.
You are consistently making new bone.
In fact, the human skeleton is replaced every 7-10 years.
But how do bones grow?
From their ends, where they have cartilage.
Growth and Development of Bones
Early in the development of a human fetus, the skeleton is made entirely of cartilage .
The relatively soft cartilage gradually turns into hard bone through ossification .
This is a process in which mineral deposits replace cartilage.
As shown in Figure below , ossification of long bones, which are found in the arms and legs, begins at the center of the bones and continues toward the ends.
By birth, several areas of cartilage remain in the skeleton, including growth plates at the ends of the long bones.
This cartilage grows as the long bones grow, so the bones can keep increasing in length during childhood.
Long bones ossify and get longer as they grow and develop.
These bones grow from their ends, known as the epiphysis, and the presence of a growth plate, or epiphyseal line, signifies that the bone is still growing.
In the late teens or early twenties, a person reaches skeletal maturity.
By then, all of the cartilage has been replaced by bone, so no further growth in bone length is possible.
However, bones can still increase in thickness.
This may occur in response to increased muscle activity, such as weight training.
Bones become increasingly ossified and grow larger during fetal development, childhood, and adolescence.
