Heat is needed to make an iron bar malleable
“Under the spreading chestnut tree ...” - The Village Blacksmith  by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. 1807-1882
Blacksmiths, like the one mentioned in Longfellow's poem, heat solid iron in order to shape it into a variety of different objects.
Iron is a rigid, solid metal.
At room temperature, it is extremely difficult to bend iron.
However, when heated to a high enough temperature, iron can be easily worked.
The heat energy in the forge is transferred to the metal, making the iron atoms vibrate more and move around more readily.
Heat is energy that is transferred from one object or substance to another because of a difference in temperature between them.
Heat always flows from an object at a higher temperature to an object a lower temperature (see Figure below ).
The flow of heat will continue until the two objects are at the same temperature.
Heat flows from a warm object to a cold object
Object A starts with a higher temperature than object B.
No heat flows when the objects are isolated from each other.
When brought into contact, heat flows from A to B until the temperatures of the two objects are the same.
