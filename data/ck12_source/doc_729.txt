A fundamental sub-atomic particle, meaning it cannot be broken into smaller particles.
Electrons are found in the “electron cloud” surrounding an atomic nucleus, or they may break free and exist as a free electron.
protons:
A stable, positively charged, sub-atomic particle, found in atomic nuclei in numbers equal to the atomic number of the element.
neutral:
A neutral particle, object, or system is one that has a net electric charge of zero.
conductors:  Materials through which electric charge can pass.
insulator:  Substances that block or retard the flow of electrical current or charge.
positive ions:
An atom or a group of atoms that has acquired a net positive charge by losing one or more electrons.
negative ions:
An atom or a group of atoms that has acquired a net negative charge by gaining one or more electrons.
ions:
An atom or a group of atoms that has acquired a net electric charge by gaining or losing one or more electrons.
electroscope:
An instrument used to detect the presence and sign of an electric charge by the mutual attraction or repulsion of metal foils.
charging by conduction:
Involves the contact of a charged object to a neutral object.
charging by induction:
A method used to charge an object without actually touching the object to any other charged object.
