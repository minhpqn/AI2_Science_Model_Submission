A kettle lake occurs where a chunk of ice was left behind in the till of a retreating glacier.
When the ice melted, it left a depression.
The meltwater filled it to form a lake.
You can see examples of kettle lakes below ( Figure below ).

Kettle lakes are found where ice sheets once covered the land.
These are in Siberia.
Try to pick out some of the glacial features seen in this Glacier National Park video:
Several types of stratified deposits form in glacial regions but are not formed directly by the ice.
Varves form where lakes are covered by ice in the winter.
Dark, fine-grained clays sink to the bottom of the lake in winter.
Melting ice in the spring brings running water that deposits lighter colored sands.
Each alternating dark/light layer represents one year of deposits.
Glaciers dump glacial till.
Glacial moraines outline a glacier's extent.
Drumlins, eskers, and kettle lakes are features made of glacial till.
Varves form in lakes covered by ice.
Varves are useful to scientists for understanding climate.
