The magnetic field behaves like a giant bar magnet inside Earth.
If you have a large bar magnet, you can hang it from a string.
Then watch as it aligns itself in a north-south direction.
It does this to line up with Earth’s magnetic field.
Earth's magnetic field is like a bar magnet that resides in the center of the planet
Earth's magnetic field is like a bar magnet that resides in the center of the planet.
The magnetic field has north and south poles.
The magnetic poles do not exactly match the geographic poles.
So the North Magnetic Pole is not the same as the geographic North Pole.
The same is true of the South Pole.
The magnetic field is created by the movement of molten metal in the outer core.
Earth’s magnetic field extends several thousand kilometers into space.
It shields us from harmful radiation from the Sun ( Figure below ).

Earth's magnetic field protects the planet from harmful radiation.
Something very strange has happened many times during Earth's history.
The planet's magnetic field flipped!
The North Magnetic Pole became the South Magnetic Pole.
The South Magnetic Pole became the North Magnetic Pole.
Scientists are not sure why this happens.
