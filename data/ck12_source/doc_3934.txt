Future Population Growth
During the month of October 2011, the world's population surpassed 7 billion people.
It took just 12 years for the population to increase by a billion people.
At this rate, there may be well over 9 billion people by 2050, and easily 10 billion people by 2100.
This raises many questions for both people and the planet.
These issues are discussed at
The human population is now growing by more than 200,000 people a day.
The human population may well be close to its carrying capacity.
It has already harmed the environment.
An even larger human population may cause severe environmental problems.
This could lead to outbreaks of disease, starvation, and global conflict.
There are three potential solutions:
Use technology to make better use of resources to support more people.
Change behaviors to reduce human numbers and how much humans consume.
Distribute resources more fairly among all the worldâ€™s people.
Which solution would you choose?
