There are two parts to this question, the magnitude of the electric field and the direction.
We will first focus on the magnitude.
To find the magnitude we will use the equation F_B=qvBsin\theta We were given the force of the magnetic field (2.2\times10^{-12}\;\mathrm{N}) and the velocity that the electron is traveling (1.8\times10^6\;\mathrm{m/s}) .
We also know the charge of the electron (1.6\times10^{-19}\;\mathrm{C}) .
Also, because the electron's velocity is perpendicular to the field, we do not have to deal with \sin\theta because \sin\theta of 90 degrees is 1 .
Therefore all we have to do is solve for B and plug in the known values to get the answer.
F_B=qvB\sin\theta\intertext{Solving for B:} B = \frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}
Now, plugging the known values we have:
B=\frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}=\frac{2.2?10^{-12}\:\mathrm{N}}{1.6\times10^{-19}\:\mathrm{C} \times 1.8\times10^6\:\mathrm{m/s}\times1}=7.6\:\mathrm{T}
Now we will find the direction of the field.
We know the direction of the velocity (east) and the direction of the force due to the magnetic field (up, out of the page).
Therefore we can use the second right hand rule (we will use the left hand, since an electron's charge is negative).
Point the pointer finger to the right to represent the velocity and the thumb up to represent the force.
This forces the middle finger, which represents the direction of the magnetic field, to point south.
Alternatively, we could recognize that this situation is illustrated for a positive particle in the right half of the drawing above; for a negative particle to experience the same force, the field has to point in the opposite direction: south.
Example 2:
Circular Motion in Magnetic Fields
Consider the following problem: a positively charged particle with an initial velocity of  \vec{v}_1  , charge  q  and mass  m  traveling in the plane of this page enters a region with a constant magnetic field \vec{B}  pointing into the page.
We are interested in finding the trajectory of this particle.
Since the force on a charged particle in a magnetic field is always perpendicular to both its velocity vector and the field vector (check this using the second right hand rule above), a constant magnetic field will provide a centripetal force --- that is, a constant force that is always directed perpendicular to the direction of motion.
