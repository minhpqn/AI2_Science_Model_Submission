The theory at that time relied on hybrid orbitals to explain all aspects of bonding.  The problem was that the theory gave incorrect prediction of bond angles for many compounds.  They developed a new approach based on earlier work by other scientists that incorporated a consideration of electron pairs in predicting three-dimensional structure.
The valence shell is the outermost electron-occupied shell of an atom.  The valence shell holds the electrons that are involved in bonding and are the electrons shown in a Lewis structure.  The acronym VSEPR stands for the valence-shell electron pair repulsion model.  The model states that electron pairs will repel each other such that the shape of the molecule will adjust so that the valence electron-pairs stay as far apart from each other as possible.
Molecules can be systematically classified according to the number of bonding pairs of electrons as well as the number of nonbonding or lone pairs around the central atom.
For the purposes of the VSEPR model, a double or triple bond is no different in terms of repulsion than a single bond.
VSEPR theory allows more accurate predictions of molecular shape.
