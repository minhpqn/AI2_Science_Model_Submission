The relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation that has this general form:
Reactants → Products
The arrow (→) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs.
In many reactions, the reaction also occurs in the opposite direction.
This is represented with another arrow pointing in the opposite direction (←).
Q:
Write a general chemical equation for the reaction that occurs when a fuel such as candle wax burns.
A:
The burning of fuel is a combustion reaction.
The general equation for this type of reaction is:
Fuel + O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 O
Q:
How do the reactants in a chemical reaction turn into the products?
A:
Bonds break in the reactants, and new bonds form in the products.
Breaking and Making Chemical Bonds
The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction.
As a result, the atoms end up in different combinations in the products.
This makes the products new substances that are chemically different from the reactants.
Consider the example of water forming from hydrogen and oxygen.
