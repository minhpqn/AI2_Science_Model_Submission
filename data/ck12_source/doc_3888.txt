In biomes with cold climates, plants may adapt by becoming dormant during the coldest part of the year.
Dormancy is a state in which a plant slows down cellular activities and may shed its leaves.
Animals also adapt to cold temperatures.
One way is with insulation in the form of fur and fat.
This is how the polar bears in Figure below stay warm.
Polar bears have insulation in the form of fur and fat in order to stay warm in their Arctic ecosystem
Thick fur and a layer of blubber keep polar bears warm in their Arctic ecosystem.
Why do you think their fur is white?
Why might it be an adaptation in an Arctic biome?
Terrestrial biomes are determined mainly by climate.
