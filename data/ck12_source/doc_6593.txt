Avoidance of foods containing lactose is recommended for people who show signs of lactose intolerance.
Since dairy products can provide many vital nutrients, tablets can be taken that provide the needed digestive materials in the small intestine.
Lactose-free milk is also readily available.
The simple sugars form the foundation of more complex carbohydrates.
The cyclic forms of two sugars can be linked together by means of a condensation reaction.
The figure below shows how a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule combine to form a sucrose molecule.
A hydrogen atom from one molecule and a hydroxyl group from the other molecule are eliminated as water, with a resulting covalent bond linking the two sugars together at that point.
Condensation of glucose and fructose creates sucrose
Glucose and fructose combine to produce the disaccharide sucrose in a condensation reaction.
Sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, is an example of a disaccharide.
A disaccharide is a carbohydrate formed by the joining of two monosaccharides.
Other common disaccharides include lactose and maltose.
Lactose, a component of milk, is formed from glucose and galactose, while maltose formed from two glucose molecules.
During digestion, these disaccharides are hydrolyzed in the small intestine to form the component monosaccharides, which are then absorbed across the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream to be transported to the cells.
