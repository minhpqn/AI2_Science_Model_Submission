Live healthy red cells
Shown are cells in various stages of their cell cycle.
Numerous dividing cells are evident.
The formation of gametes , an organismâ€™s reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg cells, involves a completely different method of cell division, called meiosis .
This cell division ensures that each gamete receives a haploid number (half the amount) of chromosomes.
cell cycle :
A repeating series of events, during which the eukaryotic cell carries out its necessary functions, including metabolism, cellular growth, DNA replication and cell division, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.
chromosome :
The coiled structure of DNA and histone proteins; allows for the precise separation of replicated DNA; forms during prophase of mitosis and meiosis.
cytokinesis :
Division of the cytoplasm, forming two daughter cells.
diploid :
The state of a cell containing two sets of chromosomes; in human somatic cells, two sets is 46 (23 pairs) chromosomes, 2n
DNA replication :
The process of copying DNA prior to cell division (eukaryotes) or reproduction (prokaryotes).
eukaryotic :
From an organism that has cells containing a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles; eukaryote.
eukaryotic cell :
Typical of multi-celled organisms; have membrane bound organelles; usually larger than prokaryotic cells.
gamete :
