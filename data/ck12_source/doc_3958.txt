Climate change can definitely be seen in numerous ecosystems.
So what will we do about it?
Global Climate Change
Another major problem caused by air pollution is global climate change.
Gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the natural greenhouse effect.
This raises the temperature of Earth’s surface.
See the NASA site Global Climate Change - Vital Signs of the Planet at for a thorough overview of this topic.
What Is the Greenhouse Effect?
The greenhouse effect is a natural feature of Earth’s atmosphere.
It occurs when gases in the atmosphere radiate the sun’s heat back down to Earth’s surface (see Figure below ).
Otherwise, the heat would escape into space.
Without the greenhouse effect, Earth’s surface temperature would be far cooler than it is.
In fact, it would be too cold to support life as we know it.

The Greenhouse Effect.
Without greenhouse gases, most of the sun’s energy would be radiated from Earth’s surface back out to space.
Global warming refers to a recent increase in Earth’s average surface temperature (see Figure below ).
During the past century, the temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F).
That may not seem like much.
But consider that just 10°C is the difference between an ice-free and an ice-covered Earth.
