When 1 mol of calcium carbonate decomposes into 1 mol of calcium oxide and 1 mol of carbon dioxide, 177.8 kJ of heat is absorbed.
The process is shown visually in Figure above (B).
The thermochemical reaction is shown below.
\text{CaCO}_3(s)+177.8 \ \text{kJ} \rightarrow \text{CaO}(s)+\text{CO}_2(g)
Because the heat is absorbed by the system, the 177.8 kJ is written as a reactant.
The heat of reaction is positive for an endothermic reaction.
\text{CaCO}_3(s) \rightarrow \text{CaO}(s)+\text{CO}_2(g) \quad \Delta H=177.8 \ \text{kJ}
The way in which a reaction is written influences the value of the enthalpy change for the reaction.
Many reactions are reversible, meaning that the product(s) of the reaction are capable of combining and reforming the reactant(s).
If a reaction is written in the reverse direction, the sign of the  \Delta H changes.
For example, we can write an equation for the reaction of calcium oxide with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate.
\text{CaO}(s)+\text{CO}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s)+177.8 \ \text{kJ}
The reaction is exothermic and thus the sign of the enthalpy change is negative.
\text{CaO}(s)+\text{CO}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s) \quad \Delta H=-177.8 \ \text{kJ}
