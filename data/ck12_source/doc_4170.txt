Classification of Flowering Plants
There are more than a quarter million species of flowering plants, and they show tremendous diversity.
Nonetheless, almost all flowering plants fall into one of three major groups: monocots, eudicots , or magnolids .
The three groups differ in several ways.
For example, monocot embryos form just one cotyledon , whereas eudicot and magnolid embryos form two cotyledons.
The arrangement of their vascular tissues is also different.
Examples of the three groups of flowering plants are given in Table below .

Most modern seed plants are angiosperms that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers.
Ovaries may develop into fruits.
Flowers attract pollinators and fruits are eaten by animals.
Both traits aid the dispersal of seeds.
