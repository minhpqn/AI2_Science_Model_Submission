It also shows how the two processes are related.
ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ):
Energy-carrying molecule that cells use to power their metabolic processes; energy-currency of the cell.
cellular respiration :
Metabolic process which transfers chemical energy from glucose (a deliverable fuel molecule) to ATP (a usable energy-rich molecule); most efficient in the presence of oxygen (aerobic).
energy :
Property of matter that is defined as the ability to do work
glucose :
The carbohydrate product of photosynthesis; serves as the universal fuel for life;
C 6 H 12 O 6 .
photosynthesis :
The process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose and oxygen, using sunlight for energy.
All organisms require a constant input of energy to do the work of life; life runs on chemical energy.
Energy cannot be recycled; energy must be constantly captured by organisms in an ecosystem, transformed and passed to other organisms.
Most energy is lost to the environment as heat.
