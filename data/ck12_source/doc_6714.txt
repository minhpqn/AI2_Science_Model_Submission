There is friction f between the tires and the road.
For the following situation, identify the 3^{rd} law force pairs on the associated free body diagrams.
Label each member of one pair A , each member of the next pair B , and so on.
The spring is stretched so that it is pulling the block of wood to the right.
Draw free body diagrams for the situation below.
Notice that we are pulling the bottom block out from beneath the top block.
There is friction between the blocks!
After you have drawn your FBDs, identify the 3^{rd} law force pairs, as above.
Discuss in class
Define friction and explain the difference between static and kinetic friction.
Solve problems involving friction.
In this lesson students will learn about friction, the difference between static and kinetic friction and how to solve problems involving friction.
\text{Static and Kinetic Friction}\begin{cases}f_s \le \mu_s | F_N| & \text{Opposes potential motion of surfaces in contact}\\\f_k = \mu_k | F_N| & \text{Opposes motion of surfaces in contact}\end{cases}
The force of friction can actually be described in terms of the coefficient of friction, \mu .
It is determined experimentally and varies depending upon the two surfaces in contact.
Static friction ( \mu_s ) acts between two surfaces that are in contact but not in motion with respect to each other.
This force prevents objects from sliding.
It always opposes potential motion, and it rises in magnitude to a maximum value given by the formula below. ^2
Kinetic friction ( \mu_k ) acts between two surfaces that are in contact and in motion with respect to each other.
This force reduces the acceleration and it always opposes the direction of motion. ^2
