A:
When the water is in the reservoir, it has potential energy because of gravity.
Potential energy is stored in the water because of its position behind the dam.
When the water flows into the intake pipe, gravity pulls it downhill to the power plant.
An electric generator is a device that produces electricity through electromagnetic induction.
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field.
Generators may produce either alternating or direct current, but they all change kinetic energy to electrical energy.
Explore the electric generator simulation at the following URL.
Then describe factors that affect the voltage of the generated current.
Identify the parts of an electric generator and what they do.
Explain how an electric generator in a hydroelectric power plant changes kinetic energy to electrical energy.
An electric motor is a device that changes electrical energy to kinetic energy.
How is an electric generator like an electric motor in reverse?
Describe an electric transformer and how it changes electric current.
Distinguish between step-up and step-down electric transformers.
You’ve probably noticed big drums like this one at the tops of electric poles.
A pole close to your home is likely to have one.
The drum is an electric transformer.
Without it, the current entering your home would have too much voltage for your home’s electric circuits to handle.
