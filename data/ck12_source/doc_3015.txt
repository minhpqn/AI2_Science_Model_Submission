Show how to calculate force from mass and acceleration.
Xander goes airborne on his scooter as he exits a half-pipe at Newton’s Skate Park.
How did he gain enough speed in the half-pipe to fly into the air when he got to the top?
His increase in speed was due partly to the force of gravity.
Acceleration, Force, and Mass
A change in an object’s motion—such as Xander speeding up on his scooter—is called acceleration .
Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.
The greater the net force acting on the object, the greater its acceleration will be, but the mass of the object also affects its acceleration.
The smaller its mass is, the greater its acceleration for a given amount of force.
Newton’s second law of motion summarizes these relationships.
According to this law, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it divided by its mass.
This can be represented by the equation:
\mathrm{Acceleration=\frac{Net\;force}{Mass}} or \mathrm{a=\frac{F}{m}}
This equation for acceleration can be used to calculate the acceleration of an object that is acted on by a net force.
For example, Xander and his scooter have a total mass of 50 kilograms.
Assume that the net force acting on Xander and the scooter is 25 Newtons.
What is his acceleration?
Substitute the relevant values into the equation for acceleration:
\text{a}=\frac{\text{F}}{\text{m}}=\frac{25 \ \text{N}}{50 \ \text{kg}}=\frac{0.5 \ \text{N}}{\text{kg}}
The Newton is the SI unit for force.
