Consider a converging lens with a focal length equal to three units and an object placed outside the focal point.
Carefully trace three rays coming off the top of the object and form the image.
Measure d_o and d_i .
Use the mirror/lens equation to calculate d_i .
Find the percent difference between your measured d_i and your calculated d_i .
Measure the magnification M and compare it to the calculated magnification.
Consider a converging lens with a focal length equal to three units, but this time with the object placed inside the focal point.
