A flower consists of male and female reproductive structures.
The main parts of a flower are shown in Figure below .
They include the stamen, pistil, petals, and sepals.
The stamen is the male reproductive structure of a flower.
It consists of a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther .
The anther contains pollen sacs, in which meiosis occurs and pollen grains form.
The filament raises the anther up high so its pollen will be more likely to blow in the wind or be picked up by an animal pollinator.
The pistil is the female reproductive structure of a flower.
It consists of a stigma, style , and ovary .
The stigma is raised and sticky to help it catch pollen.
The style supports the stigma and connects it to the ovary, which contains the egg.
Petals attract pollinators to the flower.
Petals are often brightly colored so pollinators will notice them.
Sepals protect the developing flower while it is still a bud.
Sepals are usually green, which camouflages the bud from possible consumers.

Flowers and Pollinators
Many flowers have bright colors, strong scents, and sweet nectar to attract animal pollinators.
They may attract insects, birds, mammals, and even reptiles.
