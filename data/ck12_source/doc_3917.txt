Why?
What can you infer about a species that has a random pattern of distribution over space?
A uniform pattern?
Define population growth.
Describe age-sex structures.
Relate population pyramids and survivorship curves to population structure.
Young vs. old.
Does it matter?
When it comes to populations, yes it does.
The age structure (and the sex structure) of a population influences population growth.
Can you explain why?
Population growth is the change in the size of the population over time.
An important factor in population growth is age-sex structure .
This is the number of individuals of each sex and age in the population.
The age-sex structure influences population growth.
This is because younger people are more likely to reproduce, while older people have higher rates of dying.
Age-sex structure is represented by a population pyramid .
This is a bar graph, like the one Figure below .
In this example, the bars become narrower from younger to older ages.
