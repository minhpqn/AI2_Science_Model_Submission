In stage three, the energy in the energy carriers enters an electron transport chain .
During this step, this energy is used to produce ATP.
Oxygen is needed to help the process of turning glucose into ATP.
The initial step releases just two molecules of ATP for each glucose.
The later steps release much more ATP.
Diagram of the mitochondria
Most of the reactions of cellular respiration are carried out in the mitochondria.
What goes into the cell?
Oxygen and glucose are both reactants of cellular respiration.
Oxygen enters the body when an organism breathes.
Glucose enters the body when an organism eats.
What does the cell produce?
The products of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide and water.
Carbon dioxide is transported from your mitochondria out of your cell, to your red blood cells, and back to your lungs to be exhaled.
ATP is generated in the process.
When one molecule of glucose is broken down, it can be converted to a net total of 36 or 38 molecules of ATP.
This only occurs in the presence of oxygen.
The Chemical Reaction
The overall chemical reaction for cellular respiration is one molecule of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and six molecules of oxygen (O 2 ) yields six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and six molecules of water (H 2 O).
Using chemical symbols the equation is represented as follows:
