A condition called Reye’s syndrome can occur in young people that take aspirin when they have a viral infection.
The syndrome causes swelling of the brain and may be fatal.
Fortunately, Reye’s syndrome is very rare.
The best way to prevent it is by not taking aspirin when you have a viral infection.
Products like cold medicines often contain aspirin.
So, read labels carefully when taking any medicines ( Figure below ).
Taking aspirin during a viral infection can cause brain swelling in Reye's syndrome that can be fatal
Since 1988, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has required that all aspirin and aspirin-containing products carry a warning about Reye’s syndrome.
Other Nervous System Diseases
Like other parts of the body, the nervous system may develop tumors.
A tumor is a mass of cells that grows out of control.
A tumor in the brain may press on normal brain tissues.
This can cause headaches, difficulty speaking, or other problems, depending on where the tumor is located.
Pressure from a tumor can even cause permanent brain damage.
In many cases, brain tumors can be removed with surgery.
In other cases, tumors can’t be removed without damaging the brain even more.
In those cases, other types of treatments may be needed.
Cerebral palsy is a disease caused by injury to the developing brain.
The injury occurs before, during, or shortly after birth.
