Mesosaurus fossils are found in South America and South Africa.
Mesosaurus could swim, but only in fresh water.
Cynognathus and Lystrosaurus were reptiles that lived on land.
Both of these animals were unable to swim at all.
Their fossils have been found across South America, Africa, India, and Antarctica.
Wegener thought that all of these organisms must have lived side by side.
The lands later moved apart so that the fossils are separated.
Fossil remains of organisms on South America and Africa
Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift hypothesis.
The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are now far apart.
Wegener suggested that when the organisms were alive, the lands were joined and the organisms were living side-by-side.
Distribution of Rocks and Structures
Wegener found rocks of the same type and age on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
He thought that it could not be a coincidence!
He said that the rocks must have formed side by side.
These rocks then drifted apart on separate continents.
Wegener also matched up mountain ranges across the Atlantic Ocean.
The Appalachian Mountains were just like mountain ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway.
Wegener concluded that they formed as a single mountain range.
This mountain range broke apart as the continents split up.
