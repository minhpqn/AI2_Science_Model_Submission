A human egg is much larger.
Both cells are mature haploid gametes that are capable of fertilization, shown in this photograph.
Notice the sperm with a head piece, a flagella tail that propels the sperm, and a mid piece, which is mostly mitochondria, supplying ATP.
Essentially, the head piece just contains the paternal genetic material.
On the other hand, the egg provides the other half of the DNA, but also organelles, building blocks for compounds such as proteins and nucleic acids, and other necessary materials.
The egg, being much larger than a sperm cell, contains almost all of the cytoplasm a developing embryo will have during its first few days of life.
Therefore, oogenesis is a much more complicated process than spermatogenesis.
Oogenesis begins before birth and is not completed until after fertilization.
Oogenesis begins when a diploid oogonia (singular, oogonium ), which are the immature eggs that form in the ovaries before birth, undergoes mitosis to form primary oocytes, also with the diploid number of chromosomes.
It proceeds as a primary oocyte undergoes the first cell division of meiosis to form secondary oocytes with the haploid number of chromosomes.
The one egg cell that results from meiosis I contains most of the cytoplasm, nutrients, and organelles.
This unequal distribution of materials produces one large cell, and one cell with little more than DNA.
This other cell, known as a polar body , eventually breaks down.
A secondary oocyte then undergoes the second meiotic cell division to form a haploid ovum , only if it is fertilized by a sperm.
Once again this unequal cell division will produce a large cell and a polar body.
The large cell develops into the mature egg cell.
Maturation of the ovum.
Notice only 1 mature ovum, or egg, forms during meiosis from the primary oocyte.
Three polar bodies may form during oogenesis.
These polar bodies will not form mature gametes.
