Arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood.
The largest artery is the aorta , which receives blood directly from the heart.
Veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart.
This blood is no longer under much pressure, so many veins have valves that prevent backflow of blood.
Veins generally carry deoxygenated blood.
The largest vein is the inferior vena cava , which carries blood from the lower body to the heart.
The superior vena cava brings blood back to the heart from the upper body.
Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessels.
They connect very small arteries and veins.
The exchange of gases and other substances between cells and the blood takes place across the extremely thin walls of capillaries.
Blood Vessels and Homeostasis
Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider).
These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system.
Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract.
This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ).
Dilation occurs when the walls relax.
This increases blood flows through the vessels.
Constricted blood vessels
When a blood vessel constricts, less blood can flow through it.
Constriction and dilation allow the circulatory system to change the amount of blood flowing to different organs.
