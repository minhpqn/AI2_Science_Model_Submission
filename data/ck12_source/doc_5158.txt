So that damaged DNA is not replicated, the cell cycle must be temporarily stopped so that the DNA can be repaired.
The p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of cell cycle inhibiting proteins ( Figure below ). p53 often activates a gene named p21, whose protein product temporarily stops the cell cycle.
If the DNA can not be repaired, p53 activates other genes that lead to cell death, or apoptosis.
This prevents the cell from passing on damaged DNA.
If the p53 tumor suppressor gene is defective, as by mutation, DNA damage in the cell may accumulate and the cell may survive to replicate the damaged DNA.
The damaged DNA would then be passed to other cells through many cell divisions, and cancer could develop.
Signal transduction pathways.
Ras (upper middle section) activates a number of pathways but an especially important one seems to be the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK).
MAPK transmit signals downstream to other protein kinases and gene regulatory proteins.
Note that many of these pathways are initiated when a signal binds to its receptor outside the cell.
Most pathways end with altered gene regulation and cell proliferation.
The p53 tumor suppressor protein is shown at the lower section of the figure stimulating p21.
The interrelated complexity of the pathways demonstrate the significant role these play in the cell.
apoptosis :
The process of programmed cell death that may occur in multicellular organisms.
cancer :
A disease characterized by a population of cells that grow and divide without respect to normal limits.
carcinogenesis :
The process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells; also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis.
G protein (guanine nucleotide-binding protein) :
