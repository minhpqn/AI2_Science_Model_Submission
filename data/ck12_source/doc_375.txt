Healthy Eating Guidelines
Make at least half your daily grain choices whole grains.
Examples of whole grains are whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, and brown rice.
Choose a variety of different vegetables each day.
Be sure to include both dark green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli, and orange vegetables, such as carrots and sweet potatoes.
Choose a variety of different fruits each day.
Select mainly fresh fruits rather than canned fruits, and whole fruits instead of fruit juices.
When choosing oils, choose unsaturated oils, such as olive oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil.
Choose low-fat or fat-free milk and other dairy products.
For example, select fat-free yogurt and low-fat cheese.
For meats, choose fish, chicken, and lean cuts of beef.
Also, be sure to include beans, nuts, and seeds.
