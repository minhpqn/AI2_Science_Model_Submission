Calculate the enthalpy change that occurs when 58.0 g of sulfur dioxide is reacted with excess oxygen.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem .
mass SO 2 = 58.0 g
molar mass SO 2 = 64.07 g/mol
\Delta H = -198 \text{ kJ for the reaction of } 2 \text{ mol SO}_2
\Delta H = ? \text{ kJ}
The calculation requires two steps.
The mass of SO 2 is converted to moles.
Then the mol SO 2 is multiplied by the conversion factor of \left(\frac{-198 \text{ kJ}}{2 \text{ mol SO}_2} \right) .
Step 2:
Solve .
\Delta H=58.0 \text{ g SO}_2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mol SO}_2}{64.07 \text{ g SO}_2} \times \frac{-198 \text{ kJ}}{2 \text{ mol SO}_2}=-89.6 \text{ kJ}
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The mass of sulfur dioxide is slightly less than 1 mol.
Since 198 kJ is released for every 2 mol of SO 2 that reacts, the heat released when about 1 mol reacts is one half of 198.
The 89.6 kJ is slightly less than half of 198.
The sign of  \Delta H is negative because the reaction is exothermic.
Calculations of energy changes in enthalpy equations are described.
