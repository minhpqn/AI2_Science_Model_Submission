How does this carbon in living things end up back in the atmosphere?
Remember that we breathe out carbon dioxide.
This carbon dioxide is generated through the process of cellular respiration , which has the reverse chemical reaction as photosynthesis.
That means when our cells burn food (glucose) for energy, carbon dioxide is released.
We, like all animals, exhale this carbon dioxide and return it back to the atmosphere.
Also, carbon is released to the atmosphere as an organism dies and decomposes.
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis can be described as a cycle, as one uses carbon dioxide (and water) and makes oxygen (and glucose), and the other uses oxygen (and glucose) and makes carbon dioxide (and water).
The carbon cycle tracks the flow of carbon through an ecosystem
The carbon cycle.
The cycling of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis and cellular respiration are main components of the carbon cycle.
Carbon is also returned to the atmosphere by the burning of organic matter (combustion) and fossil fuels and decomposition of organic matter.
Formation of Fossil Fuels
Millions of years ago, there were so many dead plants and animals that they could not completely decompose before they were buried.
They were covered over by soil or sand, tar or ice.
These dead plants and animals are organic matter made out of cells full of carbon-containing organic compounds (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids).
What happened to all this carbon?
When organic matter is under pressure for millions of years, it forms fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas.
When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ).
This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans.
