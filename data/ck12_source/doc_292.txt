Work resulting in motion is caused when the work is converted into kinetic energy, while work resulting in a change of position is caused by a conversion into potential energy.
Work is also spent overcoming friction and that work would be converted into heat, but we will consider primarily frictionless systems.
If we consider the potential energy of a bent stick or a stretched rubber band, the potential energy can be calculated by multiplying the force exerted by the stick or rubber band by the distance over which the force will be exerted.
The formula for calculating this potential energy looks exactly like the formula for calculating work done:
W = Fd .
The only difference is that work is calculated when the object actually moves and potential energy is calculated when the system is still at rest, before any motion actually occurs.
In the case of gravitational potential energy, the force exerted by the object is its weight and the distance it can travel is its height above the earth.
Since the weight of an object is calculated by W = mg , then gravitational potential energy can be calculated by PE = mgh , where m is the mass of the object,  g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height the object will fall.
Example Problem:
A 3.00 kg object is lifted from the floor and placed on a shelf that is 2.50 m above the floor.
(a) What was the work done in lifting the object?
(b) What is the gravitational potential energy of the object sitting on the shelf?
(c) If the object falls off the shelf and falls to the floor in the absence of air resistance, what will its velocity be when it hits the floor?
Solution: \text{weight of the object} = mg = (3.00 \ kg)(9.80 \ m/s^2) = 29.4 \ N
(a) W = Fd = (29.4 \ N)(2.50 \ m) = 73.5 \ J
(b) PE = mgh = (3.00 \ kg)(9.80 \ m/s^2)(2.50 \ m) = 73.5 \ J
(c) KE = PE \ \text{so} \ \frac{1}{2} \ mv^2 = 73.5 \ J
v= \sqrt{\frac{2KE}{m}}= \sqrt{\frac{(2)(73.5 \ J)}{3.00 \ kg}}=7.00 \ m/s
Example Problem:
A pendulum is constructed from a 7.58 kg bowling ball hanging on a 3.00 m long rope.  The ball is pulled back until the rope makes an angle of  45^\circ with the vertical.
