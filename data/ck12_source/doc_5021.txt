Use the definition of “food” to answer this question.
Compare autotrophs to heterotrophs, and describe the relationship between these two groups of organisms.
Name and describe the two types of food making found among autotrophs, and give an example of each.
Which is quantitatively more important to life on earth?
Trace the flow of energy through a typical food chain (describing "what eats what"), including the original source of that energy and its ultimate form after use.
Underline each form of energy or energy-storing molecule, and boldface each process which transfers or transforms energy.
Energy Carrying Molecules - Advanced
Discuss the importance of glucose to all life on earth.
Compare the energy-carrying role of ATP to that of glucose.
Explain the roles of chlorophyll and NADPH as sources of energy for life.
When do you need lots of energy?
To run a marathon, probably.
Where does this extra energy come from?
Remember that energy from the sun is transformed into the carbohydrate glucose.
Carbohydrate loading is a strategy used by endurance athletes to maximize the storage of energy, in the form of glycogen, in the muscles.
Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, which is then turned into ATP through the process of cellular respiration.
Food and Other Energy-Carrying Molecules
You know that the chicken you had for lunch contained protein molecules.
But do you know that the atoms in those proteins could easily have formed the color in a dragonfly’s eye, the heart of a water flea, and the whiplike tail of a Euglena before they hit your plate as sleek fish muscle?
Food consists of organic (carbon-containing) molecules which store energy in the chemical bonds between their atoms.
