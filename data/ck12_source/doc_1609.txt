This process, known as cellular respiration , produces energy is in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
Cells that use a lot of energy may have thousands of mitochondria.
Vesicles are small membrane bound sacs that transport materials around the cell and to the cell membrane.
The vacuoles are like storage centers.
Plant cells have larger vacuoles than animal cells.
Plants store water and nutrients in their large central vacuoles.
Lysosomes are like the recycling trucks that carry waste away from the factory.
Lysosomes have digestive enzymes that break down old molecules into parts that can be recycled.
In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made.
Ribosomes are like the machines in the factory that produce the factory's main product.
Proteins are the main product of the cell.
Some ribosomes can be found on folded membranes called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), others float freely in the cytoplasm.
If the ER is covered with ribosomes, it looks bumpy like sandpaper, and is called the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
If the ER does not contain ribosomes, it is smooth and called the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
Many proteins are made on the ribosomes on the rough ER.
These proteins immediately enter the ER, where they are modified, packaged into vesicles and sent to the Golgi apparatus.
Lipids are made in the smooth ER.
The Golgi apparatus works like a mail room.
The Golgi apparatus receives proteins from the rough ER and puts "shipping addresses" on them.
The Golgi then packages the proteins into vesicles and sends them to the right place in the cell or to the cell membrane.
