Explain how fish reproduce and develop.
How do fish reproduce?
Wild male and female Sockeye salmon before spawning.
Sockeye salmon are blue tinged with silver in color while living in the ocean.
Just prior to spawning, both sexes turn red with green heads.
Sockeye spawn mostly in streams having lakes in their watershed.
The young fish spend up to three years in the freshwater lake before migrating to the ocean.
Migratory fish spend from one to four years in salt water, and thus are four to six years old when they return to spawn.
Navigation to the home river is thought to be done using the characteristic smell of the stream, and possibly the sun.
Fish Reproduction and Development
Nearly all fish reproduce sexually, and most species have separate sexes.
Those without separate sexes avoid self-fertilization by producing sperm and eggs at different times.
Each fish typically produces a large number of gametes.
In most fish species, fertilization takes place externally.
These fish are oviparous .
Eggs are laid and embryos develop outside the mother’s body.
In a minority of fish, including sharks, eggs develop inside the mother’s body but without nourishment from the mother.
These fish are ovoviviparous .
In many species of fish, a large group of adults come together to release their gametes into the water at the same time.
This is called spawning.
