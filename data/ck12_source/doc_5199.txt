Blending Theory of Inheritance
During Mendel’s time, the blending theory of inheritance was popular.
This is the theory that offspring have a blend, or mix, of the characteristics of their parents.
Mendel noticed plants in his own garden that weren’t a blend of the parents.
For example, a tall plant and a short plant had offspring that were either tall or short but not medium in height.
Observations such as these led Mendel to question the blending theory.
He wondered if there was a different underlying principle that could explain how characteristics are inherited.
He decided to experiment with pea plants to find out.
In fact, Mendel experimented with almost 29,000 pea plants over the next several years!
At the following link, you can watch an animation in which Mendel explains how he arrived at his decision to study inheritance in pea plants:
artificial fertilization :
The process of transferring pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part of another flower; done in order to have seeds that will grow into plants that have a desired trait.
blending theory of inheritance :
Hypothesis that stated that offspring were a "mix" of their parents.
genetics :
The branch of biology that focuses on heredity in organisms; the study of heredity.
heredity :
The passing of characteristics from parent to offspring.
Genetics is the branch of biology that focuses on heredity in organisms.
Modern genetics is based on Mendel’s explanation of how traits are passed from generation to generation.
