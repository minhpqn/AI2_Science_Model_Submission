Describe an example of deposition in nature.
Tom, pictured in the Figure below , started to scrape frost off his windshield before driving to school on a cold morning.
Then he decided to let the car’s defroster do the work for him.
What conditions caused the windshield to become covered with frost, and how does the defroster clear the frost from the windshield?
Scraping frost off a windshield
State how popping bubble wrap demonstrates Boyle’s law.
Explain why pressure goes up when gas molecules crowd into a smaller space.
Are you one of those people who can’t resist popping the bubbles of bubble wrap?
As annoying as it might be to the people around you, do you just love to squeeze those little plastic bubbles?
Before the bubbles pop, the air pressing against the inside of the bubbles inflates them like tiny balloons.
When you pop the bubbles, most of the air rushes out.
Pop Goes the Bubble!
What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science?
Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law.
Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions.
Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa.
That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap.
You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.
Boyle’s law is named for Robert Boyle, the English scientist who discovered this relationship between gas volume and pressure.
Boyle based the law on his own controlled experiments.
