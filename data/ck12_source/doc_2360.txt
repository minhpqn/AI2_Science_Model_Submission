When scientists share their findings, they add to the body of scientific knowledge.
They may also get useful feedback from other scientists.
Scientists may communicate about their research in several ways, such as presenting posters or papers at scientific conferences and publishing articles in scientific journals.

Identify three different ways that scientists may communicate about their research.
The graph below shows the results of a scientific investigation.
Researchers measured the amount of force (in pounds) needed to penetrate hardwoods of different species.
How would you communicate the results of the investigation in words?
Replication in Science
Explain the importance of replication in science.
Did a math teacher ever tell you to check your work?
If you’re adding numbers, that means repeating the calculation to see if you get the same answer the second time.
If you get the same result twice, then the answer is probably correct.
But if you get a different answer the second time, at least one of the results must be incorrect.
Then you have to add the numbers a third time and hope that the third answer will agree with one of the other two.
Scientists also have to “check their work.” The results of an investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeated—usually many times—and the same result is always obtained.
