In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction.
This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image.
In diffuse reflection, the rays are reflected in many different directions.
This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image.
You can see animations of both types of reflection at this URL:
Schematic of regular and diffuse reflection
Law of Reflection
One thing is true of both regular and diffuse reflection.
The angle at which the reflected rays leave the surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface.
This is known as the law of reflection .
The law is illustrated in the Figure below and also in this animation:
Law of reflection
According to the law of reflection, the angle of reflection always equals the angle of incidence.
The angles of both reflected and incident light are measured relative to an imaginary line, called normal, that is perpendicular (at right angles) to the reflective surface.
Reflection is one of several ways that light can interact with matter.
When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it may form an image.
An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected (or refracted) light.
Regular reflection occurs when light reflects off a very smooth surface and forms a clear image.
Diffuse reflection occurs when light reflects off a rough surface and forms a blurry image or no image at all.
According to the law of reflection, the angle at which light rays reflect off a surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface.
