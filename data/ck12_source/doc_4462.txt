The process in which organ systems work to maintain a stable internal environment is called homeostasis .
Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments.
Here are just three of the many ways that human organ systems help the body maintain homeostasis:
Respiratory system:
A high concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood triggers faster breathing.
The lungs exhale more frequently, which removes carbon dioxide from the body more quickly.
Excretory system:
A low level of water in the blood triggers retention of water by the kidneys.
The kidneys produce more concentrated urine, so less water is lost from the body.
Endocrine system:
A high concentration of sugar in the blood triggers secretion of insulin by an endocrine gland called the pancreas.
Insulin is a hormone that helps cells absorb sugar from the blood.
So how does your body maintain homeostasis?
The regulation of your internal environment is done primarily through negative feedback.
Negative feedback is a response to a stimulus that keeps a variable close to a set value ( Figure below ).
Essentially, it "shuts off" or "turns on" a system when it varies from a set value.
For example, your body has an internal thermostat.
During a winter day, in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds by turning on or off the heater.
Your body acts in much the same way.
When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense the temperature change.
