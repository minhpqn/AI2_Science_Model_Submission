What is the velocity of the cannon ball when it strikes the earth?
Solution:
Since the angle at which the cannon ball is fired is unknown, we cannot use the usual equations from projectile motion.
However, at the moment the cannon ball is fired, it has a certain  KE due to the mass of the ball and its speed and it has a certain  PE due to its mass and it height above the earth.
Those two quantities of energy can be calculated.
When the ball returns to the earth, its  PE will be zero.
Therefore, its  KE at that point must account for the total of its original KE + PE .
T
E_{\text{TOTAL}} = KE + PE = \frac{1}{2} \ mv^2 + mgh
=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(5.00 \ kg)(30.0 \ m/s)^2 + (5.00 \ kg)(9.80 \ m/s^2)(50.0 \ m)
= 2250 \ J + 2450 \ J = 4700 \ J
\frac{1}{2} \ mv{_f}^2 = 4700 \ J \
\ v_f=\sqrt{\frac{(2)(4700 \ J)}{5.00 \ kg}}=43.4 \ m/s
Example Problem:  A 2.00 g bullet moving at 705 m/s strikes a 0.250 kg block of wood at rest on a frictionless surface.
The bullet sticks in the wood and the combined mass moves slowly down the table.
(a) What is the  KE of the bullet before the collision?
(b) What is the speed of the combination after the collision?
(c) How much  KE was lost in the collision?
(a) KE_{\text{BULLET}} = \frac{1}{2} \ mv^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0.00200 \ kg)(705 \ m/s)^2 = 497 \ J
(b) m_Bv_B + m_Wv_W = (m_{B+W})(v_{B+W})
