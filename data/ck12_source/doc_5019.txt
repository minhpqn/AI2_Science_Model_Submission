Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic (chemoautotrophs) or heterotrophic (chemoheterotrophs).
Chemoautotrophs derive their energy from chemical reactions, and synthesize all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide.
Chemoheterotrophs are unable to fix carbon to form their own organic compounds.
The various types of metabolisms are discussed in the Prokaryotes:
Nutrition and Metabolism (Advanced) concept.
This flowchart helps to determine if a species is an autotroph or a heterotroph, a phototroph or a chemotroph.
For example, “Carbon obtained from elsewhere?” asks if the source of carbon is another organism.
If the answer is “yes”, the organism is heterotrophic.
If the answer is “no,” the organisms is autotrophic.
autotroph :
Organism that produces organic compounds from energy and simple inorganic molecules; also known as a producer.
chemosynthesis :
The process by which carbon dioxide molecules are converted to carbohydrates; uses energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.
chemotroph :
An organism that breaks down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell.
consumer :
A heterotrophic organism; must eat or absorb organic food molecules.
food :
Organic (carbon-containing) molecules which store energy in the chemical bonds between their atoms.
food chain :
