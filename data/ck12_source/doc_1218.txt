Sedimentary rocks formed by the crystallization of chemical precipitates are called chemical sedimentary rocks .
Dissolved ions in fluids precipitate out of the fluid and settle out, just like the halite pictured below ( Figure below ).

Living creatures can help chemicals become sedimentary rocks.
Limestone is an example.
Organic Sedimentary Rocks
The bodies of organisms can make a sedimentary rock.
Plant bodies are lithified to become coal.
When shells are cemented together they make a type of limestone.
So limestone can be considered chemical or organic.
