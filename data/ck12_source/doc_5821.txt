Body Parts of Fungi
The most important body parts of fungi include:
Cell wall:
A layer around the cell membrane of fungi cells made largely of chitin and other polysaccharides.
It is similar to that found in plant cells, though the plant cell wall contains the polysaccharide cellulose.
Hyphae :
These are thread-like strands which interconnect and bunch up into a mycelium ( Figure below ).
Ever see mold on a damp wall or on old bread?
The things that you are seeing are really mycelia.
