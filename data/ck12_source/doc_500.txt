Thatâ€™s because your sense of smell greatly affects your ability to taste food.
As you eat, molecules of food chemicals enter your nose (actually your nasal cavity).
You experience the taste and smell at the same time.
Being able to smell as well as taste food greatly increases the number of different flavors you are able to sense.
For example, you can use your sense of taste alone to learn that a food is sweet, but you have to also use your sense of smell to learn that the food tastes like strawberry cheesecake.
Specific scents are often associated with our memories of places and events.
That's because scents are more novel or specific than shapes or other things you might see.
So an odor similar to that of your grandmother's kitchen or pantry might be more quickly associated with your memories of that place than a similar sight, which might be more generalized.
