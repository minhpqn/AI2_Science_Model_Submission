A liquid with stronger intermolecular forces does not evaporate easily and thus has a lower vapor pressure.
For example, diethyl ether is a nonpolar liquid with weak dispersion forces.
Its vapor pressure at 20°C is 58.96 kPa.
Water is a polar liquid whose molecules are attracted to one another by relatively strong hydrogen bonding.
The vapor pressure of water at 20°C is only 2.33 kPa, far less than that of diethyl ether.
Vapor Pressure and Temperature
Vapor pressure is dependent upon temperature.
When the liquid in a closed container is heated, more molecules escape the liquid phase and evaporate.
The greater number of vapor molecules strike the container walls more frequently, resulting in an increase in pressure.
The Table below shows the temperature dependence of the vapor pressure of three liquids.
Vapor Pressure (in kPa) of Three Liquids at Different Temperatures
Notice that the temperature dependence of the vapor pressure is not linear.
From 0°C to 80°C, the vapor pressure of water increases by 46.73 kPa, while it increases by 53.99 kPa in only a span of twenty degrees from 80°C to 100°C.
Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container.
Strong intermolecular forces produce a lower rate of evaporation and a lower vapor pressure.
Weak intermolecular forces produce a higher rate of evaporation and a higher vapor pressure.
As the temperature increases, the vapor pressure increases.
