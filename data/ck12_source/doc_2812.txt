This can be represented by the chemical equation:
HCl \mathrm{\overset{H_2O}{\rightarrow}} H + + Cl -
A base is a compound that produces negative hydroxide ions (OH - ) and positive metal ions when it dissolves in water.
For example, when the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in water, it produces negative hydroxide ions and positive sodium ions (Na + ).
This can be represented by the chemical equation:
NaOH \mathrm{\overset{H_2O}{\rightarrow}} OH - + Na
Q:
If you were to combine acid and base solutions, what products do you think would be produced?
A:
Combining acid and base solutions produces water and a neutral ionic compound.
Reactions of Acids and Bases
When an acid and a base react, the reaction is called a neutralization reaction .
That’s because the reaction produces neutral products.
Water is always one product, and a salt is also produced.
A salt is a neutral ionic compound.

Let’s see how a neutralization reaction produces both water and a salt, using as an example the reaction between solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.
The overall equation for this reaction is:
NaOH + HCl → H 2 O and NaCl
Now let’s break this reaction down into two parts to see how each product forms.
