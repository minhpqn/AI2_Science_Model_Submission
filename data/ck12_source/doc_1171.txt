Earth's Materials and Crust
How can you learn about Earth's crust?
Well, you could travel around and visit Earth's crust in lots of places.
You would see different minerals and rocks everywhere you went.
You would learn that certain rocks indicate that certain processes happened.
For example, the rock basalt means that there was a volcanic eruption nearby.
Since it may not be practical to take such a big trip, where else could you see materials from Earth's crust?
A museum is a great place!
