All of Earth’s weather takes place in the troposphere.
Sometimes air doesn’t mix in the troposphere.
This happens when air is cooler close to the ground than it is above.
The cool air is dense, so it stays near the ground.
This is called a temperature inversion ( Figure below ).
An inversion can trap air pollution near the surface.
Temperature inversions are more common in the winter.
Can you explain why?

Temperature Inversion and Air Pollution.
How does a temperature inversion affect air quality?
At the top of the troposphere is a thin layer of air called the tropopause.
This layer acts as a barrier.
It prevents cool air in the troposphere from mixing with warm air in the stratosphere.
In the troposphere, warm air ordinarily sits below cooler air.
With a temperature inversion, cold air sits below warm air.
This traps the cold air because it cannot rise into the warm air.
An inversion starts over land at night or in the winter, or near the coast.
