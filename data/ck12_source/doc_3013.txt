Force, Mass, and Acceleration
Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates.
Acceleration occurs whenever an unbalanced force acts on an object.
Two factors affect the acceleration of an object: the net force acting on the object and the object’s mass.
Newton’s second law of motion describes how force and mass affect acceleration.
The law states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object’s mass.
This can be represented by the equation:
Q :
While Tony races along on his rollerblades, what net force is acting on the skates?
A :
Tony exerts a backward force against the ground, as you can see in the Figure below , first with one skate and then with the other.
This force pushes him forward.
Although friction partly counters the forward motion of the skates, it is weaker than the force Tony exerts.
Therefore, there is a net forward force on the skates.

Direct and Inverse Relationships
Newton’s second law shows that there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration.
The greater the force that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate.
For example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration.
The relationship between mass and acceleration is different.
