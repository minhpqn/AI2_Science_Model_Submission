To find a mineral deposit, geologists study the geology of a lot of places.
They then go to a spot where that type of mineral deposit could be found.
They test the properties of the soil and rocks.
They look at the chemistry and the physical properties.
They determine if a mineral deposit is nearby.
After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is.
They may drill holes.
They will test the chemistry of the rock from the holes.
Using this information, they will outline the deposit on a map.
This will allow them to determine the size and the concentration of ore minerals.
The geologists then calculate the total amount of valuable minerals they think are in the deposit.
The ore will only be mined if it is profitable.
Only if it is profitable, is a mineral deposit called an ore deposit .
The bauxite pictured below ( Figure below ) is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum.
Aluminum is made from the minerals in rocks known as bauxite
Aluminum is made from the minerals in rocks known as bauxite.
If a mineral deposit is not profitable to mine it is not an ore deposit.
If conditions change, a deposit may become profitable that wasn't before.
Or an ore deposit may no longer be profitable to mine.
What could occur to make these changes?
