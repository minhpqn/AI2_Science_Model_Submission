Most bivalves have a pair of large gills that enable them to extract oxygen from the water (to breathe) and to capture food.
Water is drawn into the bivalve and washes over the gills.
Mucus on the gills helps capture food and cilia transfer the food particles to the mouth.
Once in the mouth, food passes into the stomach to be digested.
Bivalves have a mouth, heart, intestine, gills, and stomach, but no head.
Bivalves have a muscular foot, which in many species such as clams, is used to anchor their body to a surface or dig down into the sand.
Cephalopods include the octopus and squid.
They have a prominent head and a well-developed brain.
Typically the foot has been modified into a set of arms or tentacles.
Members of this class can change color.
They can also change texture and body shape, and, and if those camouflage techniques don't work, they can still "disappear" in a cloud of ink.
Cephalopods have three hearts that pump blue blood, they're jet powered by their muscular foot, and they're found in all oceans of the world.
Cephalopods are thought to be the most intelligent of invertebrates.
They have eyes and other senses that rival those of humans.
Many cephalopods are active and efficient predators.

Mollusks are divided into ten living classes, including the familiar gastropods, cephalopods, and bivalves.
Mollusks live in marine and freshwater habitats, as well as on land.
