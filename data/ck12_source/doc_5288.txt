The most well-studied example of incomplete dominance in humans occurs in the genes for curly hair.
Inheriting a gene for curly hair from one parent and a gene for straight hair from the other parent will give a hair with a phenotype intermediate between curly and straight hair, which is wavy hair.
Human height is also due to incomplete dominance, although there is more than one gene involved in height.
In this replica of Michaelangelo's David, wavy hair is apparent.
codominance :
Occurs when both traits appear in a heterozygous individual.
hemoglobin :
The iron-containing oxygen-transport protein found in red blood cells; allows oxygen to be transported in the blood.
incomplete dominance :
Occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele is not present.
sickle-cell disease :
Disease in which red blood cells form an abnormal sickle or crescent shape; also known as sickle-cell anemia.
sickle-cell trait :
A condition in which a peron produces normal and sickle-shaped red blood cells; due to heterozygosity for the normal and abnormal hemoglobin beta alleles.
Codominance is when two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygous individual.
Incomplete dominance is seen in heterozygous individuals with an intermediate phenotype.
