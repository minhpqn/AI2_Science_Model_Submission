The Spinal Cord
The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons, protected by the vertebrae.
It runs from the brain stem to the lower back.
The main job of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain.
The spinal cord is like a two-way highway.
Messages about the body, both inside and out, pass through the spinal cord to the brain.
Messages from the brain pass in the other direction through the spinal cord to tell the body what to do.
The central nervous system is made up of the brain and the spinal cord.
The brain consists of three main parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem.
