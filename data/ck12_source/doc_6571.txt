When the reactant is the halogen, the product is a disubstituted alkyl halide as in the addition of bromine to ethene.
\text{CH}_2\text{=CH}_2 (g) + \text{Br}_2 (l) \rightarrow & \ \text{CH}_2 \text{BrCH}_2 \text{Br} (g)\\& \ 1, 2\text{-dibromoethane}
Addition of bromine to ethene
The addition of bromine to an unknown organic compound is indeed a test for saturation in the compound.
Bromine has a distinctive brownish-orange color, while most bromoalkanes are colorless.
When bromine is slowly added to the compound, the orange color will fade if it undergoes the addition reaction to the hydrocarbon.
If the orange color remains, then the original compound was already saturated and no reaction occurred.
A monosubstituted alkyl halide can be produced by the addition of a hydrogen halide to an alkene.
Shown below is the formation of chloroethane.
\text{CH}_2\text{=CH}_2 (g) + \text{HCl} (g) \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Cl}(g)
A hydration reaction is a reaction in which water is added to an alkene.
Hydration reactions can take place when the alkene and water are heated to near 100Â°C in the presence of a strong acid, which acts as a catalyst.
Shown below is the hydration of ethene to produce ethanol.
\text{CH}_2\text{=CH}_2 + \text{H}_2 \text{O} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3 \text{CH}_2 \text{OH}
Under modest reaction conditions, benzene resists addition reactions because adding a molecule across a double bond in a benzene ring disrupts the ring of delocalized electrons.
This greatly destabilizes the molecule.
However, under conditions of high temperature and pressure, and with an appropriate catalyst, benzene will slowly react with three molecules of hydrogen to produce cyclohexane.
\text{C}_6 \text{H}_6 + 3\text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Pt}} \text{C}_6 \text{H}_{12}
