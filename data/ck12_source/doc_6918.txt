Electric field due to charge q at a distance r from the charge.
F = q E \; \;  ;
Force due to an electric field.
Gravity and the Coulomb force have a nice property in common: they can be represented by fields .
Fields are a kind of bookkeeping tool used to keep track of forces.
Take the electromagnetic force between two charges given above: \vec{F_e} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} If we are interested in the acceleration of the first charge only --- due to the force from the second charge --- we can rewrite this force as the product of {q_1}  and \frac{kq_2}{r^2} .
The first part of this product only depends on properties of the object we're interested in (the first charge), and the second part can be thought of as a property of the point in space where that object is.
In fact, the quantity \frac{kq_2}{r^2} captures everything about the electromagnetic force on any object possible at a distance r from q_2  .
If we had replaced  q_1  with a different charge,  q_3  , we would simply multiply  q_3  by \frac{kq_2}{r^2} to find the new force on the new charge.
Such a quantity, \frac{kq_2}{r^2} here, is referred to as the electric field from charge  q_2  at that point: in this case, it is the electric field due to a single charge: \vec{E_f} = \frac{kq}{r^2}
The electric field is a vector quantity, and points in the direction that a force felt by a positive charge at that point would.
If we are given the electric field at some point, it is just a matter of multiplication --- as illustrated above --- to find the force any charge  q_0  would feel at that point: \underbrace{\vec{F_e}}_{\text{Force on charge }q_0} = \underbrace{\vec{E_f}}_{\text{Field}} \underbrace{\times q_0}_{\text{Charge}} &&\text{Force on charge }q_0\text{ in an electric field} Note that this is true for all electric fields, not just those from point charges.
In general, the electric field at a point is the force a positive test charge of magnitude 1 would feel at that point .
Any other charge will feel a force along the same line (but possibly in the other direction) in proportion to its magnitude.
In other words, the electric field can be thought of as "force per unit charge".
In the case given above, the field was due to a single charge.
Such a field is shown in the figure below.
Notice that this a field due to a positive charge, since the field arrows are pointing outward.
The field produced by a point charge will be radially symmetric i.e., the strength of the field only depends on the distance,  r  , from the charge, not the direction; the lengths of the arrows represent the strength of the field.
