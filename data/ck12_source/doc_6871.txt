How do butterflies eat?
You might have seen butterflies searching for food on a flower before.

The butterfly uses this mouth-tube to siphon nectar from the flower, as if sucking through a straw.
What do insets eat?
Practically anything they want.
There are so many different insects, that among all of them, no potential food is safe.
Lots of insects eat plants, some insects eat other insects, and some even drink blood.
Many insects eat nectar from plants.
And some insects will eat whatever scraps of food you leave lying around.
A few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat.
Thatâ€™s because their lives are over in just a few hours or days.
Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die.
On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters.
A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth.
