Conversely, four haploid spermatids form during meiosis from the primary spermatocyte.
More on these gametes and their maturation will be presented in the Anatomy and Physiology concepts.
gametogenesis :
The further maturation of the haploid cells produced by meiosis into mature gametes capable of fertilization.
gametogonium (plural, gametogonia ):
A germ cell that divides into gametocytes during gametogenesis.
oocyte :
A female gamete or germ cell involved in reproduction; an immature ovum, or egg cell.
oogenesis :
The production of a mature egg cell, which results in just one mature ovum, or egg cell.
oogonia (singular, oogonium ):
Immature eggs that form in the ovaries before birth; they have a diploid number of chromosomes.
ovum :
A mature female gamete.
polar body :
Cell formed during oogenesis; it contains little cytoplasm and eventually breaks down, thus failing to form a gamete.
spermatid :
Cell formed during meiosis in the male prior to the formation of the mature sperm cell.
spermatocyte :
Cell formed during meiosis in the male prior to the formation of the spermatid.
