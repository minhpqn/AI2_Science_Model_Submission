In Roman mythology, Saturn was the father of Jupiter.
Saturn orbits the Sun once about every 30 Earth years.
Picture of Saturn
Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar system.
Saturn’s composition is similar to Jupiter's.
The planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
These elements are gases in the outer layers and liquids in the deeper layers.
Saturn may also have a small solid core.
Saturn's upper atmosphere has clouds in bands of different colors.
These clouds rotate rapidly around the planet.
But Saturn has fewer storms than Jupiter.
Thunder and lightning have been seen in the storms on Saturn.
Saturn's rings were first observed by Galileo in 1610.
Remember that his telescope was not very good.
He didn't know they were rings and thought that they were two large moons.
One moon was on either side of the planet.
In 1659, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens realized that they were rings circling Saturn’s equator.
The rings appear tilted.
This is because Saturn is tilted about 27 degrees to its side.
The Voyager 1 spacecraft visited Saturn in 1980.
