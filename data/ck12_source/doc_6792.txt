Some old doors have the door knob in the center of the door like in the picture below.
If you had a door of mass 20 kg and 1.5 m wide, what would be the angular acceleration if you pushed at the center of the door with a force of 50 N?
What would the angular acceleration be if you pushed at the far end of the door with the same force?
Where should you push the door if you want to open it the fastest?
To solve this problem, we will plug in the known values into Newton's second law for rotation and solve for \alpha .
When calculating the moment of inertia of the door, we'll consider it a rod being rotated about one end.
We'll first calculate the angular acceleration when pushing from the center of the door.
Now we'll calculate the angular acceleration when pushing from the end of the door.
Clearly, it is much faster and easier to open doors when pushing from the point farthest from the hinge.

In the figure we have a horizontal beam of length, L , pivoted on one end and supporting 2000 \;\mathrm{N} on the other.
Find the tension in the supporting cable, which is at the same point at the weight and is at an angle of 30 degrees to the vertical.
Ignore the weight of the beam.
Two painters are on the fourth floor of a Victorian house on a scaffold, which weighs 400 \;\mathrm{N} .
The scaffold is 3.00 \;\mathrm{m} long, supported by two ropes, each located 0.20 \;\mathrm{m} from the end of the scaffold.
The first painter of mass 75\;\mathrm{kg} is standing at the center; the second of mass, 65.0 \;\mathrm{kg} , is standing 1.00 \;\mathrm{m} from one end.
Draw a free body diagram, showing all forces and all torques. (Pick one of the ropes as a pivot point.)
Calculate the tension in the two ropes.
