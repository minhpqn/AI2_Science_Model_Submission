Solubility of a solid at differenttemperatures
If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility.
For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot water than in cold water.
If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility.
For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm water than in cold water.
The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure.
Pressure is the force pushing against a given area.
Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility.
Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can?
Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide.
Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble.
As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air.
Q:
Which do you think will fizz more when you open it, a can of warm soda or a can of cold soda?
A:
A can of warm soda will fizz more because increasing the temperature decreases the solubility of a gas.
Therefore, less carbon dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda.
Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature.
Some solutes have greater solubility than others.
Temperature affects the solubility of solutes in all three states.
