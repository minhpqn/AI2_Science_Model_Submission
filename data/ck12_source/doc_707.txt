The three light rays traveling into the concave lens shown above travel away from each other.
For this reason, concave lens are also called diverging lenses.
As a result of this light divergence, concave lenses create only virtual images.
Images in Double Concave Lenses
Every  concave lens causes all rays to diverge.
Rays that approach the lens parallel to the principal axis refract as if they came from the focal point.
Light rays passing through a concave lens
As you can see in the figure above, the light rays hit the lens and refract away from each other.
Since none of these rays will intersect, a real image cannot exist.
Instead, all images created by a double concave lens are virtual images.
Like in all ray diagrams, images can be found using two rays.
Image formed by a concave lens
The first ray, shown above, begins from the tip of the image and travels to the lens parallel to the principal axis.
Within the lens, this ray is refracted away from the principal axis such that the virtual ray (shown as a dotted line) travels back to the focal point.
The second ray also leaves from the tip of the object, and travels straight through the center of the lens.
The image will be where these two rays intersect - one real and one virtual.
Since one ray is a virtual ray, the image will always be virtual, as well as upright and diminished.
Like for convex lenses, the lens equation and magnification equations can be used to calculate image size and distance for double concave lenses.
When using the lens equation with a concave lens, however, the focal length must be assigned a negative value.
A concave lens causes all rays to diverge.
