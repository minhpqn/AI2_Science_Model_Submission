A+BC → B+ AC
2K + 2H 2 O → 2KOH + H 2
AB+ CD → AD + CB
NaCl+ AgF → NaF + AgCl
fuel + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water
CH 4 + 2O 2 → CO 2 + 2H 2 O
Q:
The burning of wood is a chemical reaction.
Which type of reaction is it?
A:
The burning of wood—or of anything else—is a combustion reaction.
In the combustion example in the table, the fuel is methane gas (CH 4
Energy In and Energy Out
All chemical reactions involve energy.
Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products.
In terms of energy, there are two types of chemical reactions: endothermic reactions and exothermic reactions.
In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when bonds form in products than is used to break bonds in reactants.
These reactions release energy to the environment, often in the form of heat or light.
In endothermic reactions, more energy is used to break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form in products.
These reactions absorb energy from the environment.
