What is the traditional definition of gravity?
Identify factors that influence the strength of gravity between two objects.
Define weight.
What is the SI unit for weight?
Explain why an astronaut would weigh less on the moon than on Earth.
Newton's Law of Gravity
Describe Newton’s law of universal gravitation, and explain why it was so important.
Identify factors that affect the strength of gravity between two objects.
You may have heard a story about Isaac Newton coming up with the idea of gravity when an apple fell out of a tree and hit him in the head.
The story isn’t true, but seeing how things like apples fall to Earth helped Newton form his ideas about gravity, the force of attraction between things that have mass.
Of course, people had known about the effects of gravity for thousands of years before Newton came along.
After all, they constantly experienced gravity in their daily lives.
They observed over and over again that things always fall toward the ground.
However, it wasn’t until Newton developed his law of gravity in the late 1600s that people knew gravity applies to everything in the universe that has mass.
Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
Newton was the first one to suggest that gravity is universal and affects all objects in the universe.
That’s why Newton’s law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation .
Universal gravitation means that the force that causes an apple to fall from a tree to the ground is the same force that causes the moon to keep moving around Earth.
Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth.
In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you—your desk, your book, your pen.
