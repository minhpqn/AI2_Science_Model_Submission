To calculate momentum with the equation above, mass is measured in (kg), and velocity is measured in meters per second (m/s).
For example, Cody and his skateboard have a combined mass of 40 kg.
If Cody is traveling at a velocity of 1.1 m/s by the time he reaches the bottom of the ramp, then his momentum is:
Momentum = 40 kg × 1.1 m/s = 44 kg • m/s
Note that the SI unit for momentum is kg • m/s.
Q :
The combined mass of Jerod and his skateboard is 68 kg.
If Jerod goes down the ramp at the same velocity as Cody, what is his momentum at the bottom of the ramp?
A :
His momentum is:
Momentum = 68 kg × 1.1 m/s = 75 kg • m/s
Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop.
It equals the object’s mass times its velocity.
To calculate the momentum of a moving object, multiply its mass in kilograms (kg) by its velocity in meters per second (m/s).
The SI unit of momentum is kg • m/s.
