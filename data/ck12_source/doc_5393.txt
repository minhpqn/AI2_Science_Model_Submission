Assume that a point mutation changes the codon AUU to AUC.
Why is this a neutral mutation?
Look at the mutation shown here.
The base A was inserted following the start codon AUG.
Describe how this mutation affects the encoded amino acid sequence:
AUG-GUC-CCU-AAA → AUG-AGU-CCC-UAA-A.
Compare and contrast germline mutations and somatic mutations.
DNA Repair - Advanced
Define and discuss the importance of DNA repair.
Describe common DNA repair mechanism.
How is DNA repaired?
Not by nanobots.
But luckily the cell does have mechanisms to repair mistakes in the DNA.
And these mechanisms involve proteins.
DNA repair refers to a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to DNA.
Many mutations have no effect on the organism because they are repaired before protein synthesis occurs.
Cells have multiple repair mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA.
One way DNA can be repaired, called nucleotide excision repair is illustrated in Figure below .
If a cell’s DNA is permanently damaged and cannot be repaired, the cell is likely to be prevented from dividing.
See Some types of mutations are automatically repaired at for an animation on mutation repair.
