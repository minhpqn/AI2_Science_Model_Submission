One example is the friction that helps the people climb the rock wall in the opening picture above.
Static friction keeps their hands and feet from slipping.
Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface.
Sliding friction is weaker than static friction.
That’s why it’s easier to slide a piece of furniture over the floor after you start it moving than it is to get it moving in the first place.
Sliding friction can be useful.
For example, you use sliding friction when you write with a pencil.
The pencil “lead” slides easily over the paper, but there’s just enough friction between the pencil and paper to leave a mark.
Q :
How does sliding friction help you ride a bike?
A :
There is sliding friction between the brake pads and bike rims each time you use your bike’s brakes.
This friction slows the rolling wheels so you can stop.
Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling over a surface.
Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or static friction.
This explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including bicycles, cars, 4-wheelers, roller skates, scooters, and skateboards.
Ball bearings are another use of rolling friction.
You can see what they look like in the Figure below .
They let parts of a wheel or other machine roll rather than slide over on another.
Ball bearings reduce friction
