The newly formed cells move up through the epidermis toward the skin surface, while producing a tough, fibrous protein called keratin .
The cells become filled with keratin and die by the time they reach the surface, where they form a protective, waterproof layer called the stratum corneum .
The dead cells are gradually shed from the surface of the skin and replaced by other cells.
Cell layers of the epidermis
Cell Layers of the Epidermis.
The epidermis consists mainly of epithelial cells.
The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin.
Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color.
Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin.
The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output.
Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D .
Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.
The dermis is the lower layer of the skin, located directly beneath the epidermis (see Figure below ).
It is made of tough connective tissue and attached to the epidermis by collagen fibers.
The dermis contains blood vessels and nerve endings.
Because of the nerve endings, skin can feel touch, pressure, heat, cold, and pain.
The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands.
Hair follicles are the structures where hairs originate.
Hairs grow out of follicles, pass through the epidermis, and exit at the surface of the skin.
Sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called sebum .
