The contractions get stronger and closer together.
They may go on for hours.
Eventually, the contractions squeeze the baby out of the uterus.
Once the baby enters the vagina, the mother starts pushing.
She soon pushes the baby through the vagina and out of her body.
As soon as the baby is born, the umbilical cord is cut.
After the cord is cut, the baby can no longer get rid of carbon dioxide through the cord and placenta.
As a result, carbon dioxide builds up in the baby’s blood.
This triggers the baby to start breathing.
The amniotic sac and placenta pass through the vagina and out of the body shortly after the birth of the baby.
A zygote develops into an embryo and then a fetus.
During pregnancy, the amniotic sac, placenta, and umbilical cord develop inside the mother’s uterus.
