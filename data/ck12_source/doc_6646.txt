A peacock using his tail feathers to communicate
This peacock is using his tail feathers to communicate.
What is he "saying"?
Communication with Scent
Some animals communicate with scent.
They release chemicals that other animals of their species can smell or detect in some other way.
Ants release many different chemicals.
Other ants detect the chemicals with their antennae.
This explains how ants are able to work together.
The different chemicals that ants produce have different meanings.
Some of the chemicals signal to all of the ants in a group to come together.
Other chemicals warn of danger.
Still other chemicals mark trails to food sources.
When an ant finds food, it marks the trail back to the nest by leaving behind a chemical on the ground.
Other ants follow the chemical trail to the food.
