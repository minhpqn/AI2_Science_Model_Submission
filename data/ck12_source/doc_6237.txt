Seasonal Changes in Plants
Describe how plants sense changes of season.
How does this plant know it's Christmas?
This plant is known as a Christmas cactus because it only blooms once a year, during the Christmas season.
But plants can't read a calendar.
How can a houseplant know the time of the year?
Have you seen the leaves of plants change colors?
During what time of year does this happen?
What causes it to happen?
Plants can sense changes in the seasons .
Leaves change color and drop each autumn in some climates ( Figure below ).
Leaves change color in a response to the shortened length of the day in autumn
Leaves changing color is a response to the shortened length of the day in autumn.
Certain flowers, like poinsettias, only bloom during the winter.
And, in the spring, the winter buds on the trees break open, and the leaves start to grow.
How do plants detect time of year?
Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature, this is not the way in which plants know the seasons are changing.
Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight, known as the photoperiod.
