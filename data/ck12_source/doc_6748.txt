The Big Idea
The universe has many remarkable qualities, among them a rather beautiful symmetry: the total amount of motion in the universe is constant.
This law only makes sense if we measure “motion” in a specific way: as the product of mass and velocity.
This product, called momentum, can be transferred from one object to another in a collision.
The rapidity with which momentum is exchanged over time is determined by the forces involved in the collision.
This is the second of the five fundamental conservation laws in physics.
The other four are conservation of energy, angular momentum, charge, and CPT. (See Feynman's Diagrams for an explanation of CPT.)
Describe what momentum is.
Calculate the momentum of objects and use conservation of momentum to solve basic problems.
Students will learn what momentum is and how to calculate momentum of objects.
In addition, students will learn how to use conservation of momentum to solve basic problems.
p = m v \; \; \text{Momentum is equal to the objects mass multiplied by its velocity}
\sum p_{\text{initial}} = \sum p_{\text{final}} \; \; \text{The total momentum does not change in closed systems}
Momentum is a vector that points in the direction of the velocity vector.
The magnitude of this vector is the product of mass and speed.
The total momentum of the universe is always the same and is equal to zero.
The total momentum of an isolated system never changes.
Momentum can be transferred from one body to another.
In an isolated system in which momentum is transferred internally, the total initial momentum is the same as the total final momentum.
Momentum conservation is especially important in collisions, where the total momentum just before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision.
