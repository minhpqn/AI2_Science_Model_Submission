Another method is used by salamanders, whereby the male deposits a packet of sperm onto the ground.
The female then pulls it into her cloaca , a single opening for her internal organ systems.
Therefore, fertilization occurs internally.
By contrast, caecilians and tailed frogs use internal fertilization , just like reptiles, birds, and mammals.
The male deposits sperm directly into the female's cloaca.
Larval stage:
When the egg hatches, the organism is legless, lives in water, and breathes with gills, resembling their evolutionary ancestors (fish).
During the larval stage, the amphibian slowly transforms into an adult by losing its gills and growing four legs.
Once development is complete, it can live on land.
Amphibians live in both water and on land; amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills.
The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs.
Adaptations for land in amphibians include protective skin and eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water.
