Discovery of Radioactivity
List key scientists involved in the development of information about radioactivity.
Symbol for the presence of radioactive materials
What does that sign mean?
If you visit the nuclear medicine department of a large hospital, you are very likely to see the symbol shown above.
The sign means that radioactive materials are present and special safety precautions need to be taken.
These materials are used for diagnosis and treatment of many diseases.
The people using these materials are specially trained to handle them safely.
Radioactive materials can be dangerous and should be respected, but need not be feared.
Discovery of Radioactivity
John Dalton first proposed his atomic theory in an 1804 lecture to the Royal Institution, a prestigious British scientific society.
In this talk, he put forth the idea that all atoms of an element were identical and that atoms were indestructible.
In a little over 100 years, both of these ideas were shown to be incorrect.
In 1919, studies on atomic weights led Francis Aston (1877-1925) to the conclusion that some elements with different atomic weights were actually the same element in different isotope forms.
Aston used a mass spectrograph to separate isotopes of different elements.
He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work in 1922.
In 1895, Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen produced great interest in what caused the phenomenon of x-rays.
One researcher of this phenomenon was Henri Becquerel.
Becquerel studied the fluorescent properties of uranium salts, believing they had something to do with X-rays.
He soon learned that uranium could expose a photographic plate without an external input of energy (thought to be needed to produce uranium fluorescence).
