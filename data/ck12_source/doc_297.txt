(0.00200 \ kg)(705 \ m/s) + (0.250 \ kg)(0 \ m/s) = (0.252 \ kg)(V)
(1.41 \ kg \ m/s) =(0.252 \ kg)(V)
V = 5.60 \ m/s
(c) KE_{\text{COMBINATION}} = \frac{1}{2} \ mv^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0.252 \ kg)(5.60 \ m/s)^2 = 3.95 \ J
KE_{\text{LOST}} = KE_{\text{BEFORE}} - KE_{\text{AFTER}} = 497 \ J - 4 \ J = 493 \ J
In a closed system, energy may change forms but the total amount of energy is constant.

Practice problems with answers for the law of conservation of energy:
A 15.0 kg chunk of ice falls off the top of an iceberg.  If the chunk of ice falls 8.00 m to the surface of the water,
what is the kinetic energy of the chunk of ice when its hits the water, and
what is its velocity?
An 85.0 kg cart is rolling along a level road at 9.00 m/s.  The cart encounters a hill and coasts up the hill.
Assuming the movement is frictionless, at what vertical height will the cart come to rest?
Do you need to know the mass of the cart to solve this problem?
A circus performer swings down from a platform on a rope tied to the top of a tent in a pendulum-like swing.
