Rock samples from many places on the ocean floor show that the north and south magnetic poles reversed hundreds of times over the last 330 million years.
The last reversal was less than a million years ago.
Q:
What might happen if a magnetic reversal occurred in your lifetime?
How might it affect you?
A:
For ideas, learn more about Earth’s magnetic reversals at this URL:
Earth’s magnetic poles have switched places repeatedly over hundreds of millions of years, each time reversing Earth’s magnetic field.
Magnetic domains in rocks on the ocean floor provide evidence for magnetic field reversals in the past.
