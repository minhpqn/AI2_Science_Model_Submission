Concave lenses create only virtual images.
After the rays are refracted, they never converge and so there will be no real images.
All concave lens images will be upright, virtual, and diminished, and can be found between the F  and the lens.
When using the lens equation with a concave lens, the focal length must be assigned a negative value.
