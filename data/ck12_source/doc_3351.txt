The magnetic field is the region around a magnet over which it exerts magnetic force.
We think of today’s magnetic field direction as “normal,” but that’s only because it’s what we’re used to.
You can watch a simulation of a magnetic field reversal at this URL:
Earth with reversed poles
Fact, not Fiction
Scientists don’t know for certain why magnetic reversals occur, but there is hard evidence that they have for hundreds of millions of years.
The evidence comes from rocks on the ocean floor.
Look at Figure below .
They show the same ridge on the ocean floor during different periods of time.
Magnetic patterns in seafloor spreading proves that magnetic reversals occur
A.
At the center of the ridge, hot magma pushes up through the crust and hardens into rock.
Once the magma hardens, the alignment of magnetic domains in the rock is frozen in place forever.
Magnetic domains are regions in the rocks where all the atoms are lined up and pointing toward Earth’s north magnetic pole.
B.
The newly hardened rock is gradually pushed away from the ridge in both directions as more magma erupts and newer rock forms.
The alignment of magnetic domains in this new rock is in the opposite direction, showing that a magnetic reversal has occurred.
C.
A magnetic reversal occurs again.
It is frozen in rock to document the change.
