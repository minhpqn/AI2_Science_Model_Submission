What passes into the cells from the capillaries?
What are the ventricles?
Where does oxygen-poor blood first enter the heart?
What part of the heart pumps blood to the rest of the body?
What is the purpose of the valves in the heart?
List the three types of blood vessels.
Describe the major arteries and veins.
Distinguish between systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation.
Why are these arteries so important?
The major arteries of the neck are shown here in red.
The heart pumps oxygen-rich blood through these arteries to the brain.
Without oxygen, the brain cannot survive longer than just a few minutes.
So these arteries in the neck are very important.
Blood Vessels and Blood Circulation
The blood vessels are an important part of the cardiovascular system.
They connect the heart to every cell in the body.
Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins return blood to the heart ( Figure below ).
Diagram of the circulation of blood from the heart
The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood into pulmonary circulation, while the left side pumps oxygenated blood into systemic circulation.
