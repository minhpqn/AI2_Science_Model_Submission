The law was passed in 1972.
International groups are trying to improve global water quality.
The United Nations and other groups provide the technology for treating water.
They educate people in how to protect and improve their water ( Figure below ).
Scientists studying water pollution
Scientists control water pollution by sampling the water and studying the pollutants that are in the water.
Water treatment is a series of processes that remove unwanted substances from water.
The goal of water treatment is to make the water safe to return to the natural environment or to the human water supply.
Treating water for other purposes may not include all the same steps.
Thatâ€™s because water used in agriculture or industry may not have to be as clean as drinking water.
Below, you can see how water for drinking is treated ( Figure below ).
Treating drinking water requires at least four processes:
Chemicals are added to untreated water.
They cause solids in the water to clump together.
This is called coagulation .
The water is moved to tanks.
The clumped solids sink to the bottom of the water.
This is called sedimentation .
The water is passed through filters that remove smaller particles from the water.
This is called filtration .
