All molecular motion ceases at absolute zero (0 K).
Therefore, the entropy of a pure crystalline substance at absolute zero is defined to be equal to zero.
As the temperature of the substance increases, its entropy increases because of an increase in molecular motion.
The absolute or standard entropy of substances can be measured.
The symbol for entropy is  S and the standard entropy of a substance is given by the symbol S^{\circ} , indicating that the standard entropy is determined under standard conditions.
The units for entropy are J/K • mol.
Standard entropies for a few substances are shown in the Table below :
Standard Entropy Values at 25°C
S^\circ(\text{J/K} \cdot \text{mol})
H 2 (g)
O 2 (g)
H 2 O(l)
H 2 O(g)
The knowledge of the absolute entropies of substances allows us to calculate the entropy change  (\Delta S^\circ) for a reaction.
For example, the entropy change for the vaporization of water can be found as follows:
\Delta S^\circ &=S^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)) - S^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)) \\&=188.7 \ \text{J/K} \cdot \text{mol} - 69.9 \ \text{J/K} \cdot \text{mol}=118.8 \ \text{J/K} \cdot \text{mol}
The entropy change for the vaporization of water is positive because the gas state has higher entropy than the liquid state.
In general, the entropy change for a reaction can be determined if the standard entropies of each substance are known.
The equation below can be applied.
\Delta S^\circ=\sum nS^\circ(\text{products}) - \sum nS^\circ (\text{reactants})
