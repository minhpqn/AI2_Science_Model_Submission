The average speed for the trip is:
\text{speed} & =\frac{120 \ \text{mi}}{3 \ \text{h}}\\\& =40 \ \text{mi/h}
Q:
Terri rode her bike very slowly to the top of a big hill.
Then she coasted back down the hill at a much faster speed.
The distance from the bottom to the top of the hill is 3 kilometers.
It took Terri ¼ hour to make the round trip.
What was her average speed for the entire trip? ( Hint :
The round-trip distance is 6 km.)
A:
Terri’s speed can be calculated as follows:
\text{speed} & =\frac{6 \ \text{km}}{0.25 \ \text{h}}\\\& =24 \ \text{km/h}
When you travel by car, you usually don’t move at a constant speed.
Instead you go faster or slower depending on speed limits, traffic lights, the number of vehicles on the road, and other factors.
For example, you might travel 65 miles per hour on a highway but only 20 miles per hour on a city street (see the pictures in the Figure below .) You might come to a complete stop at traffic lights, slow down as you turn corners, and speed up to pass other cars.
Therefore, your speed at any given instant, or your instantaneous speed, may be very different than your speed at other times.
Instantaneous speed is much more difficult to calculate than average speed.

Cars on a highway have a greater speed than cars in city traffic
Cars race by in a blur of motion on an open highway but crawl at a snail’s pace when they hit city traffic.
