T_2=71^\circ \text{C}=344 \text{ K}
V_2= ? \text{ L}
Use Charles’s law to solve for the unknown volume (V_2) .
The temperatures have first been converted to Kelvin.
Step 2:
Solve.
First, rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for V_2 .
V_2=\frac{V_1 \times T_2}{T_1}
Now substitute the known quantities into the equation and solve.
V_2=\frac{2.20 \text{ L} \times 344 \text{ K}}{295 \text{ K}}=2.57 \text{ L}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The volume increases as the temperature increases.
The result has three significant figures.
Increasing the temperature of a gas at constant pressure will produce and increase in the volume.
