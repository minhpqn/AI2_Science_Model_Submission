Describe the inheritance of many physical characteristics.
How is DNA inherited?
In chromosomes.
The DNA winds up numerous times to form the compact structure. 44 of your 46 chromosomes are autosomes.
The other two determine your sex.
There are 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes in the human genome, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).
Sex chromosomes specify an organism's genetic sex.
Humans can have two different sex chromosomes, one called X and the other Y.
Normal females possess two X chromosomes and normal males one X and one Y.
An autosome is any chromosome other than a sex chromosome.
The Figure below shows a representation of the 24 different human chromosomes.
Figure below shows a karyotype of the human genome.
A karyotype depicts, usually in a photograph, the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any large chromosomal abnormalities.
Karyotypes use chromosomes from the metaphase stage of mitosis.
The 24 human chromosomes.
The autosomes are numbered 1 - 22, based on size, with chromosome 1 being the largest.
The X and Y sex chromosomes are shown in the box.
A karyotype of the human genome.
Is this from a male or female?
The 22 autosomes are numbered based on size, with the largest chromosome labeled chromosome 1.
