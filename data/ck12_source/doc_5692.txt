Even higher frequency incoming light (blue) causes ejection of the same number of electrons but with greater speed.
Consider the  E=hv equation.
The  E is the minimum energy that is required in order for the metal’s electron to be ejected.
If the incoming light’s frequency, v , is below the threshold frequency, there will never be enough energy to cause electron to be ejected.
If the frequency is equal to or higher than the threshold frequency, electrons will be ejected.
As the frequency increases beyond the threshold, the ejected electrons simply move faster.
An increase in the intensity of incoming light that is above the threshold frequency causes the number of electrons that are ejected to increase, but they do not travel any faster.
The photoelectric effect is applied in devices called photoelectric cells , which are commonly found in everyday items such as a calculator which uses the energy of light to generate electricity.
Photoelectric cells power a calculator
Photoelectric cells convert light energy into electrical energy which powers this calculator.
Light has properties of both a wave and a particle.
The photoelectric effect is produced by light striking a metal and dislodging electrons form the surface of the metal.
