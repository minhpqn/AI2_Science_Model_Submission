An electric shock occurs when there is a sudden discharge of static electricity.
What Is Static Electricity?
Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on objects.
Charges build up when negative electrons are transferred from one object to another.
The object that gives up electrons becomes positively charged, and the object that accepts the electrons becomes negatively charged.
This can happen in several ways.
One way electric charges can build up is through friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.
When you wipe your rubber-soled shoes on the wool mat, for example, electrons rub off the mat onto your shoes.
As a result of this transfer of electrons, positive charges build up on the mat and negative charges build up on you.
Once an object becomes electrically charged, it is likely to remain charged until it touches another object or at least comes very close to another object.
That’s because electric charges cannot travel easily through air, especially if the air is dry.
Q:
You’re more likely to get a shock in the winter when the air is very dry.
Can you explain why?
A:
When the air is very dry, electric charges are more likely to build up objects because they cannot travel easily through the dry air.
This makes a shock more likely when you touch another object.
What happens when you have become negatively charged and your hand approaches the metal doorknocker?
Your negatively charged hand repels electrons in the metal, so the electrons move to the other side of the knocker.
This makes the side of the knocker closest to your hand positively charged.
