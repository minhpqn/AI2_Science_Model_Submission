Sunspots on the Sun
The darker regions in this image are sunspots.
A loop of the Sun’s magnetic field may break.
This creates solar flares .
Solar flares are violent explosions that release huge amounts of energy ( Figure below ).
The streams of high energy particles they emit make up the solar wind .
Solar wind is dangerous to spacecraft and astronauts.
Solar flares can even cause damage on Earth.
They have knocked out entire power grids and can disturb radio, satellite, and cell phone communications.
Picture of a solar flare
The solar flare is the bright area in the lower right.
Another amazing feature on the Sun is solar prominences .
Plasma flows along the loop that connects sunspots.
This plasma forms a glowing arch.
The arch is a solar prominence.
Solar prominences can reach thousands of kilometers into the Sun’s atmosphere.
Prominences can last for a day to several months.
Prominences can be seen during a total solar eclipse.
Solar Dynamics Observatory
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched on February 11, SDO is studying the Sun’s magnetic field.
