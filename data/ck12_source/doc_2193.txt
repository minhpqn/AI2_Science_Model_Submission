Scientists also have evidence that there is also a lot of ice just under the Martian surface.
The ice melts when volcanoes erupt.
At these times liquid water flows across the surface.
Curiosity, the rover, has found evidence of a flowing stream on Mars.
Layers of smooth, water-polished pebbles have been photographed.
This is exactly what you would see in a stream on Earth.
There are many surface features that look like water-eroded canyons.
Since there was liquid water on Mars, scientists think that life might have existed there in the past.
One of Curiosity's tasks is to sample the soil to search for carbon and other evidence of life.
Two Martian Moons
Mars has two very small, irregular moons, Phobos ( Figure below ) and Deimos.
These moons were discovered in 1877.
They are named after the two sons of Ares, who followed their father into war.
The moons were probably asteroids that were captured by Martian gravity.
Phobos, one of Mars' moons
Phobos is Marsâ€™ larger moon.
It has a radius of 11.1 km (6.9 miles).
Mars is the easiest planet to study because it doesn't have thick clouds obscuring its surface.
It is also close to Earth.
The surface of Mars has volcanoes and canyons.
