The elastic band will spring back to its original shape.
When that happens, watch out!
Some of the band’s elastic potential energy will be transferred to the stone, which will go flying through the air.
Other Forms of Potential Energy
All of the examples of potential energy described above involve movement or the potential to move.
The form of energy that involves movement is called mechanical energy.
Other forms of energy also involve potential energy, including chemical energy and nuclear energy.
Chemical energy is stored in the bonds between the atoms of compounds.
For example, food and batteries both contain chemical energy.
Nuclear energy is stored in the nuclei of atoms because of the strong forces that hold the nucleus together.
Nuclei of radioactive elements such as uranium are unstable, so they break apart and release the stored energy.
Potential energy is energy that is stored in a person or object.
Gravitational potential energy is due to the position of an object above Earth’s surface.
The object has the potential to fall due to gravity.
Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s weight and its height above the ground (GPE = weight x height).
Elastic potential energy is due to an object’s shape.
It results when an elastic object is stretched or compressed.
The more it is stretched or compressed, the greater its elastic potential energy is.
Chemical energy and nuclear energy are other forms of potential energy.
