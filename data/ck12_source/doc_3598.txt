It lets organisms live in places where there is little or no oxygen.
Such places include deep water, soil, and the digestive tracts of animals such as humans (see Figure below ).
Artifically colored E. coli
E. coli bacteria are anaerobic bacteria that live in the human digestive tract.
Another advantage of anaerobic respiration is its speed.
It produces ATP very quickly.
For example, it lets your muscles get the energy they need for short bursts of intense activity (see Figure below ).
Aerobic respiration, on the other hand, produces ATP more slowly.
Hurdlers using anaerobic respiration for energy
The muscles of these hurdlers need to use anaerobic respiration for energy.
It gives them the energy they need for the short-term, intense activity of this sport.
Aerobic respiration produces much more ATP than anaerobic respiration.
Anaerobic respiration occurs more quickly than aerobic respiration.
