Group 13 has three valence electrons, Group 14 has four, up through Group 18 with eight.  The eight valence electrons, a full outer s and p sublevel, give the noble gases their special stability.
When examining chemical bonding, it is necessary to keep track of the valence electrons of each atom.  Electron dot diagrams are diagrams in which the valence electrons of an atom are shown as dots distributed around the elementâ€™s symbol.
A beryllium atom, with two valence electrons, would have the electron dot diagram below.
Electron dot diagram for beryllium
Since electrons repel each other, the dots for a given atom are distributed evenly around the symbol before they are paired.
The Table below shows the electron dot diagrams for the entire second period.

Electron dot diagrams would be the same for each element in the representative element groups.  Most transition elements have two valence electrons, though some that have unusual electron configurations have only one.
Electron dot diagrams show the valence electrons for an atom.
The dot diagrams are the same for each element in the representative element groups.
