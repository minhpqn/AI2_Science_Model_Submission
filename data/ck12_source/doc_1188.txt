A certain mineral may form in different colors.
For example, pictured below are four samples of quartz ( Figure below shows), including one that is colorless and one that is purple.
The purple color comes from a tiny amount of iron.
Iron is not normally found in quartz.
When it is, it is a chemical impurity.
Many minerals are colored by chemical impurities.
Other factors can also affect a mineralâ€™s color.
Weathering changes the surface of a mineral.
Because color alone is unreliable, geologists rarely identify a mineral just on its color.
To identify most minerals, they use several properties.
Quartz comes in many different colors including: (A) transparent quartz, (B) blue agate, (C) rose quartz, and (D) purple amethyst.
Streak is the color of the powder of a mineral.
To do a streak test, you scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate.
The plate is harder than many minerals, causing the minerals to leave a streak of powder on the plate.
The color of the streak often differs from the color of the larger mineral sample ( Figure below ).
Yellow-gold pyrite has a blackish streak.
This blackish streak tells you that the mineral is not gold, because gold has a gold-colored streak.
Rub a mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate to see its streak.
Hematite has a reddish-brown streak.
Streak is more reliable than color to identify minerals.
