\text{d = spacing of slits}
\text{m = number of maximum (i.e. m = 0 is the central maximum, m = 1 is the 1st maximum and thus the first dot to the right and left of the center, etc.)}
\text{L = distance form diffraction grating to screen}
\Delta y = \text{distance from nth spot out from the center (if m = 1 then it is the 1st spot)}
Maximum = place where waves constructively interfere
Minimum = place where waves destructively interfere
Because the screen distance L is much larger than the slit distance d , one can see that
\frac{\Delta y}{L} = \text{tan} \theta \approx \text{sin} \theta  .
Thus, the condition for a first maximum becomes
\lambda = d \sin{\theta} = d \frac{\Delta y}{L}
One can now easily calculate where the first maximum should appear if given the wavelength of the laser light, the distance to the screen and the distance between slits.
First Maximum:  \Delta y = \frac {L \lambda}{d}
White light (which is comprised of all wavelengths and thus all colors) separates into a rainbow pattern as shown below.
Each wavelength of light has a unique interference pattern given by the equation above.
Thus all the wavelengths (i.e. colors) have a unique  \Delta y  based on the equation given at the end of Example 1.
This is how white light separates out into its individual wavelengths producing a rainbow after going through a diffraction grating.
