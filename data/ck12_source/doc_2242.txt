An ancient zodiac
How did astrology come to be?
There is no reason to think that the alignment of the stars has anything to do with events that happen on Earth.
The constellations are patterns made from stars in the sky.
The patterns do not reflect any characteristics of the stars themselves.
When scientific tests are done to provide evidence in support of astrological ideas, the tests fail.
When a scientific idea fails, it is abandoned or modified.
Astrologers do not change or abandon their ideas when they fail.
So astrology is not science.
The points of light in the night sky are stars that are balls of gas.
They are lit by nuclear fusion.
Constellations are patterns of stars seen from Earth.
These stars are usually not near each other.
Stars in a constellation may be fairly close together.
More likely, though, they are extremely far apart.
