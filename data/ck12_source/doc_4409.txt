Some mammals are omnivores .
They routinely eat a variety of both plant and animal foods.
Most mammals also feed on a variety of other species.
The few exceptions include koalas, which feed only on eucalyptus plants, and giant pandas, which feed only on bamboo.
Types of mammalian diets and examples of mammals that eat them are given in Table below .

Different diets require different types of digestive systems.
Mammals that eat a carnivorous diet generally have a relatively simple digestive system.
Their food consists mainly of proteins and fats that are easily and quickly digested.
Herbivorous mammals, on the other hand, tend to have a more complicated digestive system.
Complex plant carbohydrates such as cellulose are more difficult to digest.
Some herbivores have more than one stomach.
The stomachs store and slowly digest plant foods.
Mammalian teeth are also important for digestion.
Mammals have four different types of teeth.
The teeth of other vertebrates, in contrast, are all alike.
The four types of teeth are specialized for different feeding functions, as shown in Figure below .
Together, the four types of teeth can cut, tear, and grind food.
This makes food easier and quicker to digest.
