Decomposers break down the remains and other wastes and release simple inorganic molecules back to the environment.
Producers can then use the molecules to make new organic compounds.
The stability of decomposers is essential to every ecosystem.
Decomposers are classified by the type of organic matter they break down:
Scavengers consume the soft tissues of dead animals.
Examples of scavengers include vultures, raccoons, and blowflies.
Detritivores consume detritus —the dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the soil or at the bottom of a body of water.
On land, detritivores include earthworms, millipedes, and dung beetles (see Figure below ).
In water, detritivores include “bottom feeders” such as sea cucumbers and catfish.
Saprotrophs are the final step in decomposition.
They feed on any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do their work.
Saprotrophs include fungi and single-celled protozoa.
Fungi are the only organisms that can decompose wood.
A dung beetle is an example of a detritivore
Dung Beetle.
This dung beetle is rolling a ball of feces to its nest to feed its young.
