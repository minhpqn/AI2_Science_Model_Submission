What phenomenon is virtually certain to occur in the future?
What do you expect to happen if you increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere?
What has happened to the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the past several decades (use numbers and units)?
What has happened to sea level since 1870 (use numbers and units)?
What are some of the effects of climate change that are already being seen?
Impact of Continued Global Warming
Describe likely impacts of continued global warming.
“The Inuit see this and the world should know this...”
“It’s happening right before our eyes” — 23-year-old Jordan Konek is one of the Inuit , the native people of the Arctic.
He told this to the 2011 Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa.
Native people in the Arctic see changes much more than people in lower latitudes.
More warming is occurring in the polar regions.
How Will Climate Change in the Future?
Earth’s temperature will keep rising unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed.
The temperature in 2100 may be as much as 5° C (9° F) higher than it was in 2000.
Is 5° C (9° F) a lot?
It's more than the increase in temperature from the the times of maximum ice during the Pleistocene to now.
Since the end of the Pleistocene, the temperature has only risen about 4° C.
That's just 4° C from abundant ice to the moderate climate we have today.
How might a 5° C increase in temperature affect Earth in the future?
