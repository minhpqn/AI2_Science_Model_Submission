Algae is sometimes mocked as a source of fuel.
But algae are a potentially wonderful source of power.
They convert energy from the Sun into food by photosynthesis.
Algae can be grown in desert areas where other crops cannot grow.
Nutrients for algae may be wastes from other processes.
Algae can be processed to be made into a liquid.
There is a lot of research going on to harness algae for biofuels.
Biomass is the material that comes from plants and animals that were recently living.
Biomass can be burned directly.
This happens when you burn a log in your fireplace.
For as long as humans have had fire, people have used biomass for heating and cooking.
To generate biomass energy, break down the cell walls of plants.
This releases the sugars.
The sugars are then fermented to create fuel.
More recently, people have learned to process biomass to make fuel.
This is called biofuel .
Biofuel is created from crops, such as corn or algae.
Biofuel is unique among renewable energy sources.
This is because it is liquid.
Unlike solar energy, for example, biofuels can be used in a car ( Figure below ).
