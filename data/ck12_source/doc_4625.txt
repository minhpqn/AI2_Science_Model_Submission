When this occurs, the penis gets bigger and stiffer.
The urethra passes through the penis.
Sperm pass out of the body through the urethra. (During urination, the urethra carries urine from the bladder.)
The two testes (singular, testis) are located below the penis.
They hang between the thighs in a sac of skin called the scrotum .
Each testis contains more than 30 meters (over 90 feet) of tiny, tightly packed tubules called seminiferous tubules .
These tubules are the functional units of the testes.
They produce sperm and secrete testosterone .
The seminiferous tubules within each testis join to form the epididymis.
The epididymis (plural, epididymis) is a coiled tube about 6 meters (20 feet) long lying atop the testis inside the scrotum.
The functions of the epididymis are to mature and store sperm until they leave the body.
Ducts and Glands
In addition to these organs, the male reproductive system consists of a series of ducts and glands.
Ducts include the vas deferens and ejaculatory ducts.
They transport sperm from the epididymis to the urethra in the penis.
Glands include the seminal vesicles and prostate gland .
They secrete substances that become part of semen.
Semen is the fluid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of the body.
In addition to sperm, it contains secretions from the glands.
The secretions control pH and provide sperm with nutrients for energy.
