The conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA is referred to as the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction.
It is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
This process produces one NADH electron carrier while releasing a CO 2 molecule.
This step is also known as the link reaction or transition step, as it links glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.
Of course, as two pyruvates result from glycolysis, two acetyl-CoAs are produced as are 2 NADH molecules.
After glycolysis, two 3-carbon pyruvates enter the mitochondrion, where they are converted to two 2-carbon acetyl-CoenzymeA (CoA) molecules.
Acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs Cycle.
Note that the carbons removed become carbon dioxide, accounting for two of the six such end products of glucose oxidation.
The energy released by this breakdown is carried by NADH.
The Krebs cycle completes the breakdown of glucose begun in glycolysis.
If oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted to AcetylCoA.
AcetylCoA enters the cycle by combining with 4-carbon oxaloacetate.
Study the diagram to confirm that each turn of the cycle (two for each glucose) stores energy in 3 NADH+H + , one FADH 2 , and one ATP (from GTP), and releases 2 CO 2 .
The Krebs cycle is also known as the Citric Acid Cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle).
Within the mitochondria, each pyruvate is broken apart and combined with a coenzyme known as CoA to form a 2-carbon molecule, Acetyl-CoA, which can enter the Krebs Cycle.
A single atom of carbon (per pyruvate) is “lost” as carbon dioxide.
The energy released in this breakdown is captured in two NADH molecules.
See Figure above .
Fatty acids can also break down into Acetyl-CoA.
By this means, lipids, like fats, can be “burned” to make ATP using the Krebs Cycle.
