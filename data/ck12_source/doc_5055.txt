Thus, carbon dioxide and water are products of burning wood fuel.
The oxygen atoms have been incorporated into carbon dioxide and water.
Bromothymol blue (BTB) changes from blue to green to yellow as carbon dioxide is added.
Thus, it is a good indicator for this product of burning or cellular respiration.
The oxygen atoms have been incorporated into carbon dioxide and water, but what is the sources of the carbon atoms in the CO 2 and of the hydrogen atoms in the water.
These atoms make up the wood fuel – and nearly all fuels we burn, from coal to propane to candle wax to gasoline.
Overall, burning is the combining of oxygen with hydrogen and carbon atoms in a fuel (combustion or oxidation) to release the stored chemical energy as heat and light.
Products of combustion are CO 2 (oxidized carbon) and H 2 O (oxidized hydrogen).
The equation can be modified to:
Recall that breathing rate and oxygen intake is related to energy use.
Burning consumes oxygen as it releases stored chemical energy, transforming it into light and heat.
Cellular respiration is actually a slow burn.
Your cells absorb the oxygen carried by your blood from your lungs, and use the O 2 to release stored chemical energy so that you can use it.
Stages of Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions.
As you saw earlier, the reactions can be summed up in this equation:
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Chemical Energy (in ATP)
The reactions of cellular respiration can be grouped into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle), and electron transport.
Figure below gives an overview of these three stages, which are also described below.
Cellular respiration takes place in the stages shown here.
