Projectile Motion Problem Solving
Use the equations of motion in two dimensions in order to solve projectile motion problems.
Students will learn how to use the equations of motion in two dimensions in order to solve problems for projectiles.
It is necessary to understand how to break a vector into its x and y components.
Break the Initial Velocity Vector into its Components
Apply the Kinematics Equations
\textbf{Vertical Direction} && \textbf{Horizontal Direction}\\\y(t) = y_i +v_{iy} t - \tfrac{1}{2} g t^2 && x(t) = x_{i} +v_{ix}t\\\v_{y}(t) = v_{iy} -gt && v_{x}(t) = v_{ix} \\\{v_y}^2 = {v_{0y}}^2 - 2g (\Delta y) && \\\a_y = -g = -9.8 \mathrm{m/s^2} \approx -10\mathrm{m/s^2} && a_x = 0\\\
To work these problems, separate the “Big Three” equations into two sets: one for the vertical direction, and one for the horizontal.
Keep them separate.
The only variable that can go into both sets of equations is time; use time to communicate between the x and y components of the object's motion.
CSI discovers a car at the bottom of a 72 m cliff.
How fast was the car going if it landed 22m horizontally from the cliff’s edge? (Note that the cliff is flat, i.e. the car came off the cliff horizontally).
Question: v = \ ? \ [m/s]
Given: h = \Delta y = 72 \ m
{\;}\qquad \quad d = \Delta x = 22 \ m
{\;}\qquad \quad g = 10.0 \ m/s^2
Equation: h = v_{iy} t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2 and d = v_{ix} t
