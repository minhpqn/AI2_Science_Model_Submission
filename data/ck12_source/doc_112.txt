Among the most popular are Russian tortoises, Greek spur-thighed tortoises, and terrapins.
Large constrictor snakes like pythons, boa constrictors, and anacondas are powerful wild animals capable of killing an adult human, and they are commonly kept as pets.
Many people don't think this is a wise idea, as these reptiles pose dangerous threats to people, especially children.
Reptiles are capable of recognizing people by voice, sight and smell; many are capable of learning.
Some species actually benefit from interaction with humans.
When cared for properly, all live as long or longer than mammalian pets of similar size.
Having a reptile as a pet, you get to learn about everything from adaptation, behavior and the environment, to nutrition, camouflage and reproductive strategies.
Learning about the natural history and proper captive care of these animals just might change your world outlook and get you thinking more about the environment as a whole.
Keep in mind that if you want to have a snake as a pet, that there are no herbivorous snakes, and you must be willing to feed it a proper diet.
Be prepared to feed your snake, or other reptile, mice, rats, birds' eggs, insects, or fish.
And these need to be served raw.
Of course, the herbivorous reptiles, such as the green iguanas and some tortoises, are much easier to feed.
They eat foods such as chopped collard greens, romaine lettuce, chopped squash and bananas.
Reptiles in Art and Culture
Finally, reptiles play a significant role in folklore, religion, and popular culture.
The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped reptiles and often put lizards in their art.
Snakes or serpents are connected to healing and to the Devil.
Since snakes shed and then heal again, they are a symbol of healing and medicine, as shown in the Rod of Asclepius ( Figure below ).
In Egyptian history, the Nile cobra is found on the crown of the pharaoh.
This snake was worshiped as one of the gods.
