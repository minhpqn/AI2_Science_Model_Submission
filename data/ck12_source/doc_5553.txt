All substances can exist in any of these three states.
Note:
Technically speaking a fourth state of matter called plasma exists, but it does not naturally occur on earth, so we will omit it from our study here.
Liquids have the following characteristics:
no definite shape (takes the shape of its container)
has definite volume
particles are free to move over each other, but are still attracted to each other
A familiar liquid is mercury metal.
Mercury is an anomaly.
It is the only metal we know of that is liquid at room temperature.
Mercury also has an ability to stick to itself (surface tension) – a property all liquids exhibit.
Mercury has a relatively high surface tension, which makes it very unique.
Here you see mercury in its common liquid form.
Mercury is a liquid at room temperature
If we were to heat liquid mercury to its boiling point of 357°C, and under the right pressure conditions, we would notice all particles in the liquid state go into the gas state.
Gases have the following characteristics:
no definite shape (takes the shape of its container)
no definite volume
particles move in random motion with little or no attraction to each other
Solids are defined by the following characteristics:
