Using Nutrition Facts Labels
In the United States and other nations, packaged foods are required by law to have nutrition facts labels.
A nutrition facts label ( Figure below ) shows the nutrients in a food.
Packaged foods are also required to list their ingredients.
The information listed at the right of the label tells you what to look for.
At the top of the label, look for the serving size.
The serving size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label.
A cup of food from the label pictured below is a serving.
The calories in one serving are listed next.
In this food, there are 250 calories per serving.
