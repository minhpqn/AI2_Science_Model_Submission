Deposition also occurs high above the ground when water vapor in the air changes to ice crystals.
In the atmosphere, the ice crystals are deposited on tiny dust particles.
These ice crystals form clouds, generally cirrus clouds, which are thin and wispy.
You can see cirrus clouds in the Figure below .
Cirrus clouds form from deposition
Q:
Cirrus clouds form only at altitudes of 6 kilometers or higher above sea level.
Do you know why?
A:
At this altitude, the atmosphere is always very cold.
Unless the air is cold, water vapor will condense to form water droplets instead of ice crystals.
In chemistry, deposition refers to the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state.
Examples of deposition in nature include frost forming on the ground and cirrus clouds forming high in the atmosphere.
