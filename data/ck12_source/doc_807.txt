In nature, there are limits.
Sometimes, there will be plenty of food.
Sometimes, a fire will wipe out all of the available nutrients.
Sometimes a predator will kill many individuals in a population.
How do you think these limits affect the way organisms grow?
Usually, populations first grow exponentially while resources are abundant.
But as populations increase and resources become less available, rates of growth slow down and slowly level off, reaching the carrying capacity.
The carrying capacity is the upper limit to the population size that the environment can support.
This type of growth is shown as an "S-shaped" curve below ( Figure above ) and is called logistic growth.
Why do you think occurs?
Population growth rate is affected by birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration.
If a population is given unlimited amounts of food, moisture, and oxygen, and other environmental factors, it will show exponential growth.

How many years did it take the human population to increase from 1 billion to 2 billion?
Considering how long it took the human population to reach 1 billion, is this pattern consistent with an exponential growth model?
How fast is the human population currently increasing?
What kind of growth does this indicate the human population is experiencing currently?
Does this rate represent an increase or decrease from previous growth rates?
