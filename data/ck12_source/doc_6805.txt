Cosine is easier in this case so we will work with it instead of sine.
As we can see from the graph, the amplitude is 2, the vertical shift is 0, and the horizontal shift is -.4 .
We solved for the period already.
Therefore, we can write the sinusoidal equation of this graph.
AcosB(x-C)+D=2cos\pi(x+.4)

While treading water, you notice a buoy way out towards the horizon.
The buoy is bobbing up and down in simple harmonic motion.
You only see the buoy at the most upward part of its cycle.
You see the buoy appear 10 times over the course of one minute.
What kind of force that is leading to simple harmonic motion?
What is the period (T) and frequency (f) of its cycle?
Use the proper units.
The pitch of a Middle C note on a piano is 263\;\mathrm{Hz} .
This means when you hear this note, the hairs in your ears wiggle back and forth at this frequency.
What is the period of oscillation for your ear hairs?
What is the period of oscillation of the struck wire within the piano?
The Sun tends to have dark, Earth-sized spots on its surface due to kinks in its magnetic field.
The number of visible spots varies over the course of years.
