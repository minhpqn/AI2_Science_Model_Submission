A solution is a homogeneous mixture.
In a homogeneous mixture, the dissolved particles are spread evenly through the mixture.
The particles of the solution are also too small to be seen or to settle out of the mixture.
To put solutions in context as a type of mixture, watch the video at this URL:

Parts of a Solution
All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent.
The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute.
Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent.
Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure below , is an example of a solution.
In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent.
Oceans are made of a solution of salt and water
Q:
A scientist obtained a sample of water from the Atlantic Ocean and determined that the sample was about 3.5 percent dissolved salt.
Predict the percent of dissolved salt in a sample of water from the Pacific Ocean.
A:
As a solution, ocean water is a homogeneous mixture.
Therefore, no matter where the water sample is obtained, its composition will be about 3.5 percent dissolved salt.
Soluble or Insoluble?
Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water.
