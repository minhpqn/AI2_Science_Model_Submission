Genetic recombination after duplication of different domains forms new combinations of domains with new functions.
For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for color vision and one for night vision; all four arose from a single ancestral gene.
DNA sequences that can translocate around the genome comprise a significant fraction of the genetic material of plants and animals.
There may be some evolutionary significance to these movable elements.
One example is the Alu sequence or Alu element.
More than a million copies of the Alu sequence are present in the human genome, making this transposon equivalent to just under 11% of the human genome.
Alu insertions are sometimes disruptive and can result in inherited disorders.
The insertion or deletion of Alu sequences are associated with some specific effects in humans, including breast cancer, familial hypercholesterolemia, hemophilia and neurofibromatosis.
Alu elements are about 300 base pairs long and are classified as short interspersed elements (SINEs) among the class of repetitive DNA elements.
It is believed modern Alu elements evolved from a head to tail fusion of two distinct antique RNA monomers over 100 million years ago.
The monomers are opposing but complementary RNA fragments joined by an A-rich linker.
Alu elements are derived from the signal recognition particle RNA.
This RNA is the RNA component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) ribonucleoprotein complex.
This complex is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein that directs the traffic of proteins within the cell and allows them to be secreted.
The Alu element probably originated from a 7SL RNA gene after deletion of a central sequence.
Human SRP RNA.
Alu elements were derived from a similar sequence.
Notice all the hairpin loops of repeating complimentary sequence.
