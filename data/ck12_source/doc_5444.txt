ras :
A small GTPase involved in transmitting signals within cells; first identified in rat sarcoma cells.
tumor suppressor gene :
Gene whose product temporarily discourage cell growth and division to allow cells to finish routine functions, especially DNA repair.
At least two separate mutations are necessary to develop cancer.
These mutations may occur in proto-oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes.
Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have an interconnected relationship within the cell; many are involved in signal transduction cascades.
