Calculate the force necessary to slide a 4.7-kg chair across a room at a constant speed if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the chair and the floor is 0.68.
Question:
F = ? [N]
Given: m = 4.7\ kg
{\;}\qquad \quad \mu_k = 0.68
{\;} \qquad \quad g = 10.0\ m/s^2
Equations: \sum F = ma
{\;}\qquad \ \qquad \sum F_y = N - mg = 0, \text{so}\ N = mg
{\;}\qquad \ \qquad \sum F_x = ma_x
{\;}\qquad \ \qquad F_{\text{pull}} - f_k = 0 \ (\text{because the chair is moving at}\ constant \ speed,\ \text{so}\ a=0)
{\;}\qquad \ \qquad F_{\text{pull}} = \mu_k N
Plug nâ€™ Chug:
The force necessary to move the chair at a constant speed is equal to the frictional force between the chair and the floor.
However in order to calculate the frictional force you must first determine the normal force which is (in this case) equal to the weight (i.e.
F_g ) of the chair.
N & = mg = (4.7 \ kg)(10 \ m/s^2) = 47 \ N \\\F_{\text{pull}} &= \mu_k \ N = (0.68)(47 \ N) = 32 \ N
Answer: \boxed{\mathbf{32 \ N}}
