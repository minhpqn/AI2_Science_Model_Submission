Biotechnology has been used to create transgenic crops.
Transgenic crops are genetically modified with new genes that code for traits useful to humans.
The diagram in Figure below shows how a transgenic crop is created.
You can learn more about how scientists create transgenic crops with the interactive animation "Engineer a Crop:
Transgenic Manipulation" at this link:
Creating a transgenic crop
Creating a Transgenic Crop.
A transgenic crop is genetically modified to be more useful to humans.
The bacterium transfers the T-DNA (from the Ti plasmid) fragment with the desired gene into the host plant's nuclear genome.
Transgenic crops have been created with a variety of different traits, such as yielding more food, tasting better, surviving drought, and resisting insect pests.
Scientists have even created a transgenic purple tomato that contains a cancer-fighting compound and others that have high levels of antioxidants (see Figure below ).

To learn how scientists have used biotechnology to create plants that can grow in salty soil, watch the video "Salt of the Earth - Engineering Salt-tolerant Plants" at this link:

Transgenic Purple Tomato.
A purple tomato is genetically modified to contain a cancer-fighting compound.
A gene for the compound was transferred into normal red tomatoes.
