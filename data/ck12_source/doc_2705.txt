A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another element in one compound.
This type of reaction is represented by:
A + BC → B + AC.
A double replacement reaction occurs when two ionic compounds exchange ions, producing two new ionic compounds.
This type of reaction is represented by:
AB + CD → AD + CB.
Examine the double replacement reactions at the following URL.
Watch the movies of the reactions, and relate the molecular diagrams to the slides and still photos.
Select one of the reactions, and write a paragraph describing what occurs during the reaction.
Explain how you can tell that a chemical change has occurred, and identify which compound is the precipitate.
What is a replacement reaction?
Compare and contrast single and double replacement reactions, and give the general equation for each type of reaction.
Which of the following reactions is not a replacement reaction?
Fe + CuSO 4 → FeSO 4 + Cu
2Na + 2H 2 O → 2NaOH + H 2
Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl 2 + H 2
2Na + Cl 2 → 2NaCl
