As shown in the image below, longitudinal waves are a series of compressions and rarefactions , or expansions.
The wavelength of longitudinal waves is measured by the distance separating the densest compressions.
The amplitude of longitudinal waves is the difference in media density between the undisturbed density to the highest density in a compression.
Parts of a longitudinal wave
Example Problem:
A sonar signal (sonar is sound waves traveling through water) of  1.00 \times 10^6 Hz frequency has a wavelength of 1.50 mm in water.  What is the speed of sound in water?
Solution: v=\lambda f =(0.00150 \ \text{m})(1.00 \times 10^6 \ \text{s}^{-1})=1500 \ \text{m/s}
Example Problem:
A sound wave of wavelength 0.70 m and velocity 330 m/s is produced for 0.50 s.
What is the frequency of the wave?
How many complete waves are emitted in this time interval?
After 0.50 s, how far is the wave front from the source of the sound?
f=\frac{v}{\lambda}=\frac{330 \ \text{m/s}}{0.70 \ \text{m}}=470 \ \text{s}^{-1}
\text{complete waves} = (470 \ \text{cycles/s})(0.50 \ \text{s}) = 235 \ \text{cycles}
\text{distance} = (330 \ \text{m/s})(0.50 \ \text{s}) = 115 \ \text{m}
Longitudinal waves cause the particles of medium to move parallel to the direction of the wave.
