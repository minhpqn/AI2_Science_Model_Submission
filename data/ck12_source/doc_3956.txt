These trees in a European forest were killed by acid rain.
There are two types of ozone .
You can think of them as bad ozone and good ozone.
Both are affected by air pollution.
Bad ozone forms near the ground when sunlight reacts with pollutants in the air.
Ground-level ozone is harmful to the respiratory systems of humans and other animals.
Good ozone forms in a thin layer high up in the atmosphere, between 15 and 35 kilometers above Earth’s surface.
This ozone layer shields Earth from most of the sun’s harmful UV radiation.
It plays an important role in preventing mutations in the DNA of organisms.
Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution.
The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases.
They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products.
Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica.
Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth.
In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts.
It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs.
The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life.
Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.
Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released into the air, mainly by human actions.
The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels.
