For Lactobacillus bacteria, the acid resulting from fermentation kills bacterial competitors in buttermilk, yogurt, and some cottage cheese.
The benefits extend to humans who enjoy these foods, as well ( Figure below ).
Lactobacillus bacteria use the same type of anaerobic respiration as our muscle cells.
Lactic acid reduces competition from other bacteria and flavors yogurt.
You may have noticed this type of fermentation in your own muscles, because muscle fatigue and pain are associated with lactic acid.
Lactic acid accumulates in your muscle cells as fermentation proceeds during times of strenuous exercise.
During these times, your respiratory and cardiovascular system cannot transport oxygen to your muscle cells, especially those in your legs, fast enough to maintain aerobic respiration.
To allow the continuous production of some ATP, your muscle cells use lactic acid fermentation.
fermentation :
Type of anaerobic respiration that includes glycolysis followed by the conversion of pyruvic acid to one or more other compounds and the formation of NAD + ; the process of producing ATP in the absence of oxygen through glycolysis.
lactic acid fermentation :
The process for making ATP in the absence of oxygen by converting glucose to lactic acid.
obligate aerobe :
An organism which requires oxygen for cellular respiration.
Some bacteria, including those we employ to make yogurt, make ATP using lactic acid fermentation.
Muscle cells can continue to produce ATP when oxygen runs low using lactic acid fermentation, but muscle fatigue and pain may result.
