They transfer energy across space as well as through matter.
Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies, and higher-frequency waves have more energy.
The full range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
It is outlined in the following Figure below .
Radio waves lie at the far left of the electromagnetic spectrum
Introducing Radio Waves
Electromagnetic waves on the left side of the Figure above are called radio waves.
Radio waves are electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths.
They may have wavelengths longer than a soccer field.
They are also the electromagnetic waves with the lowest frequencies.
With their low frequencies, they have the least energy of all electromagnetic waves.
Nonetheless, radio waves are very useful.
They are used for radio and television broadcasts and many other purposes.

Q:
Based on the electromagnetic spectrum Figure above , what is the range of frequencies of radio waves?
A:
The range of frequencies of radio waves is between 105 and 1012 Hz, or waves per second.
AM and FM Radio
