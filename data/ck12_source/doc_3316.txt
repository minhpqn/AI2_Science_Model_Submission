Describe properties of a metal wire that would minimize its resistance to electric current.
Extend the rugby analogy to explain why a longer wire has greater resistance to electric current.
Copper wires have about one-third the resistance of tungsten wires.
Why would copper be less suitable than tungsten as a filament in an incandescent light bulb?
Electric Conductors and Insulators
Relate electric current to matter.
Define electric conductor, and give examples of conductors.
Describe electric insulators, and identify materials that are insulators.
Do you see the wires and peaks on top of this old house?
They are lightning rods, and their purpose is to protect the building in the event of a lightning strike.
Each lightning rod is connected to a wire that goes down the side of the house and into the ground.
If lightning strikes the building, it will target the rod and be conducted by the rod and wire into the ground.
There the electricity can be safely absorbed.
Lightning rods may differ in style, but to work they must be good at conducting electricity.
Electric Current and Matter
Electrical energy is transmitted by moving electrons in an electric current.
In order to travel, electric current needs matter.
It cannot pass through empty space.
However, matter resists the flow of electric current.
Thatâ€™s because flowing electrons in current collide with particles of matter, which absorb their energy.
