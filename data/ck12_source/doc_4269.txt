Segmented Invertebrates.
Earthworm (Annelid) and Black Ant (Arthropod).
An earthworm consists of many small segments.
An ant has three larger segments.
Notice the ants jointed legs and “feelers.”
Some invertebrates evolved a notochord .
This is the stiff support rod in a chordate .
The first chordates were probably similar to modern invertebrate chordates.
The sea squirt in Figure below is an example.
Later, some invertebrate chordates evolved into vertebrates.
Notochord.
A sea squirt is an invertebrate with a notochord.
Many important traits evolved in invertebrates.
They include: multicellularity, tissues and organs, radial and bilateral symmetry, cephalization, mesoderm, complete digestive system, coelom, segmented body, and notochord.
