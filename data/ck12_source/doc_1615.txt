The composition of the cell membrane helps to control what can pass through it.
Composition of the Cell Membrane
Molecules in the cell membrane allow it to be semipermeable.
The membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids (a "bilayer") and proteins ( Figure below ).
Recall that phospholipids, being lipids, do not mix with water.
It is this quality that allows them to form the outside barrier of the cell.
A single phospholipid molecule has two parts:
A polar head that is hydrophilic , or water-loving.
A fatty acid tail that is hydrophobic , or water-fearing.
The composition of the cell membrane
The cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer, two layers of phospholipid molecules.
Notice the polar head group of the phospholipid is attached to the phosphate, and the tails are two fatty acid chains.
The head group and tails are attached by a glycerol backbone.
There is water found on both the inside and the outside of cells.
Since hydrophilic means water-loving, and they want to be near water, the heads face the inside and outside of the cell where water is found.
The water-fearing, hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the cell membrane, because water is not found in this space.
The phospholipid bilayer allows the cell to stay intact in a water-based environment.
An interesting quality of the plasma membrane is that it is very "fluid" and constantly moving, like a soap bubble.
This fluid nature of the membrane is important in maintaining homeostasis.
It allows the proteins in the membrane to float to areas where they are needed.
