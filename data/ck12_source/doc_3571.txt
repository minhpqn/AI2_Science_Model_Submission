Look again at the overall equation below.
What is left?
Waiting in the wings is one more reactant, carbon dioxide, and yet to come is the star product, which is food for all life – glucose.
These key players perform in the second act of the photosynthesis drama, in which food is “made from thin air!”
The second stage of photosynthesis can proceed without light, so its steps are sometimes called “light-independent” or “dark” reactions (though the term ‘‘dark’’ reactions can be misleading).
Many biologists honor the scientist, Melvin Calvin, who won a 1961 Nobel Prize for working out this complex set of chemical reactions, naming it the Calvin cycle .
The Calvin cycle has two parts.
First carbon dioxide is ‘‘fixed’’.
Then ATP and NADPH from the light reactions provide energy to combine the fixed carbons to make sugar.

Carbon Dioxide is “Fixed”
Why does carbon dioxide need to be fixed?
Was it ever broken?
Life on Earth is carbon-based.
Organisms need not only energy but also carbon atoms for building bodies.
For nearly all life, the ultimate source of carbon is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), an inorganic molecule.
CO 2 makes up less than 1% of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Animals and most other heterotrophs cannot take in CO 2 directly.
They must eat other organisms or absorb organic molecules to get carbon.
