The home’s electrical system must have step-down transformers that lower the voltage for some of the home’s circuits.
The electrical grid is the entire electrical system that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power throughout a region or country.
It includes power plants, transmission lines, and electric substations.
Power plants are where electric power originates.
They have electric generators that generate electric current through electromagnetic induction.
Transmission lines carry electric current from power plants to substations and from substations to homes and other places where electric power is needed.
Electric substations have step-up or step-down transformers to increase or decrease the voltage of current as needed.

Be sure to read the “Energy Safety Note!” at the bottom of the Web page.
Then answer the questions below.
What is the voltage of current produced at power plants?
Why is the voltage increased before it is transmitted through the electrical grid?
Some of the electricity that is transmitted is lost.
Explain why.
What happens to electricity when it reaches substations near businesses and homes?
Some new distribution lines are underground rather than overhead.
What is a pro of underground lines?
List two tips for staying safe around the electrical grid.
Identify the components of an electrical grid.
What is the source of power in an electrical grid?
