The region also experiences earthquakes.
However, large earthquakes only hit every 300 to 600 years.
The last was in 1700.
That quake had an estimated magnitude of around 9.
A quake of that magnitude today could produce an incredible amount of destruction and untold fatalities.
An image of earthquake epicenters beneath the Pacific Northwest and the depth to the epicenter is shown here:
Elastic rebound at a subduction zone generates an earthquake in this animation:
The collision of two continents also creates massive earthquakes.
Many earthquakes happen in the region in and around the Himalayan Mountains.
The 2001 Gujarat, India earthquake is responsible for about 20,000 deaths, with many more people injured or made homeless ( Figure below ).

Earthquakes occur all along the subducting plate as it plunges into the mantle.
All three types of convergent plate boundaries produce massive earthquakes.
Subduction zones around the Pacific Rim are responsible for many of the world's earthquakes.

Earthquake epicenters delineate something important.
What is that?
Why do earthquakes happen at divergent plate boundaries?
