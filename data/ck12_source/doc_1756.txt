When the number of sunspots is high, the Sun gives off more energy than usual.
Still, there is little evidence for climate changing along with the sunspot cycle.
Plate movements cause continents to drift closer to the poles or the Equator.
Ocean currents also shift when continents drift.
All these changes can affect Earth’s temperature.
Plate movements trigger volcanoes.
A huge eruption could spew so much gas and ash into the air that little sunlight wouldn't reach the surface for months or years.
This could lower Earth’s temperature.
A large asteroid hitting Earth would throw a lot of dust into the air.
This could block sunlight and cool the planet.
Earth goes through regular changes in its position relative to the Sun.
Its orbit changes slightly.
Earth also wobbles on its axis of rotation.
The planet also changes its axial tilt , the angle of its axis of rotation.
These changes can affect Earth’s temperature.
Earth's climate has been warmer and colder, but mostly warmer, through Earth history.
Many natural processes change Earth's climate.
These include sunspots, plate tectonics, volcanism, asteroid impacts, and Earth's motions.
The Pleistocene Ice Age lasted from 2 million to 14,000 years ago.
Earth’s temperature was only 5° C (9° F) cooler than it is today.
