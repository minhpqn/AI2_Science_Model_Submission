Multicellular Life Originates
For life to become even more complex, multicellular organisms needed to evolve.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can be multicellular.
Toward the end of the Precambrian, the Ediacara fauna evolved ( Figure below ).
The Ediacara fauna was extremely diverse.
The organisms appeared after Earth defrosted from a worldwide glaciation.
The Ediacara fauna seems to have died out without leaving descendants.
Other multicellular organisms appeared in the Phanerozoic.
