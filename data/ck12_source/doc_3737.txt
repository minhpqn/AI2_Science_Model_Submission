What causes this type of mutation?
Assume that a point mutation changes the codon AUU to AUC.
Why is this a silent mutation?
Look at the following mutation:
AUG-GUC-CCU-AAA â†’ AUG-AGU-CCC-UAA-A.
The base A was inserted following the start codon AUG.
Describe how this mutation affects the encoded amino acid sequence.
