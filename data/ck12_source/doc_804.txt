Of course, individuals may also move away from a population.
What does population growth mean?
You can probably guess that it means the number of individuals in a population is increasing.
The population growth rate tells you how quickly a population is increasing or decreasing.
What determines the population growth rate for a particular population?
Births, Deaths, and Migration
Population growth rate depends on birth rates and death rates, as well as migration.
First, we will consider the effects of birth and death rates.
You can predict the growth rate by using this simple equation: growth rate = birth rate â€“ death rate.
If the birth rate is larger than the death rate, then the population grows.
If the death rate is larger than the birth rate, what will happen to the population?
The population size will decrease.
If the birth and death rates are equal, then the population size will not change.
Factors that affect population growth are:
Age of organisms at first reproduction.
How often an organism reproduces.
The number of offspring of an organism.
The presence or absence of parental care.
How long an organism is able to reproduce.
The death rate of offspring.
