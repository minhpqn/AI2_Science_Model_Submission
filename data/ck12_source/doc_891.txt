Oil deposits were formed over hundreds of millions of years.
They cannot be quickly replenished.
Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource.
A nonrenewable resource is a natural resource that is consumed or used up faster than it can be made by nature.
Two main types of nonrenewable resources are fossil fuels and nuclear power.
Fossil fuels , such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, formed from plant and animal remains over periods from 50 to 350 million years ago.
They took millions of years to form.
Humans have been consuming fossil fuels for less than 200 years, yet remaining reserves of oil can supply our needs only until around the year 2055.
Natural gas can only supply us until around 2085.
Coal will last longer, until around the year 2250.
That is why it is so important to develop alternate forms of energy, especially for our cars.
Today, electric cars are becoming more and more common.
What would happen if we ran out of gasoline?
Alternative use of energy, especially in transportation, must become a standard feature of all cars and trucks and planes by the middle of the century.
Nuclear power is the use of nuclear energy ( nuclear fission ) to create energy inside of a nuclear reactor ( Figure below ).
Nuclear power is developed from atoms in certain elements, such as uranium.
Currently, there are limited uranium fuel supplies, which will last to about the year 2100 (or longer) at current rates of use.
However, new technologies could make some uranium fuel reserves more useful.
Nuclear power is generated using a nonrenewable resource
