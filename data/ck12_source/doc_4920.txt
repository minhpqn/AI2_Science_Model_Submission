Junctions are areas between cells that either allow or prevent the movement of materials.
Junctions are usually composed of numerous proteins, forming a large molecular complex.
Gap junctions, desmosomes and tight junctions are three examples of junctions.
A gap junction or nexus is a specialized intercellular connection between a variety of animal cell-types.
This junction is a type of "opening," or channel, directly connecting the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules and ions to pass freely between these cells.
One gap junction channel is composed of two connexons which connect across the intercellular space.
Six connexins proteins create one connexon (hemichannel) channel.
Each connexin protein has four transmembrane domains.
The complete gap junction is a macromolecular complex composed of several to hundreds of individual junctions.
Gap junctions are especially important in cardiac muscle cells.
The action potential signaling contraction is passed efficiently and effortlessly through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem.
Electrical synapses in the brain also pass through gap junctions.
This allows action potentials at the synaptic terminals to be transmitted across to the postsynaptic cell without the need of a neurotransmitter.
Gap junctions are analogous to the plasmodesmata that join plant cells.
A desmosome is a cell junction specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion.
They are found in simple and stratified squamous epithelium, and in muscle tissue where they bind muscle cells to one another.
These junctions are composed of complexes of cell surface adhesion proteins and linking proteins.
These proteins have both an intracellular and extracellular region.
Inside the cell, they attach to intracellular filaments of the cytoskeleton.
Outside the cell, they attach to other adhesion proteins.
