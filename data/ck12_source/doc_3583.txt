The process begins with a molecule of glucose, which has six carbon atoms.
What happens to each of these atoms of carbon?
Structure of the Mitochondrion:
Key to Aerobic Respiration
The structure of the mitochondrion is key to the process of aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) cellular respiration, especially the Krebs cycle and electron transport.
A diagram of a mitochondrion is shown in Figure below .
Shows the structure of a mitochondrion, which plays an important role in aerobic respiration
The structure of a mitochondrion is defined by an inner and outer membrane.
This structure plays an important role in aerobic respiration.
As you can see from Figure above , a mitochondrion has an inner and outer membrane.
The space between the inner and outer membrane is called the intermembrane space.
The space enclosed by the inner membrane is called the matrix.
The second stage of cellular respiration, the Krebs cycle, takes place in the matrix.
The third stage, electron transport, takes place on the inner membrane.
Cellular respiration takes the energy stored in glucose and transfers it to ATP.
Cellular respiration has three stages: glycolysis: the Krebs cycle and electron transport.
The inner and outer membranes of the mitochondrion play an important roles in aerobic respiration.
