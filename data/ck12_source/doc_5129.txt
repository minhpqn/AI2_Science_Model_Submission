Prokaryotic cell division is a much simpler process.
In prokaryotic cell division, after the single chromosome is copied, the cell grows larger.
Eventually the two chromosomes separate and move to opposite ends of the cell.
Newly formed cell membrane then grows into the center of the cell, separating the two chromosomes, and forming two genetically identical daughter cells.
Some eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, also divide by binary fission.
Binary fission can be described as a series of steps, although it is actually a continuous process.
The steps are described below and also illustrated in Figure below .
They include DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and finally the separation into two daughter cells.
Step 1:
DNA Replication.
Just before the cell divides, its DNA is copied in a process called DNA replication.
This results in two identical chromosomes instead of just one.
This step is necessary so that when the cell divides, each daughter cell will have its own chromosome.
Step 2:
Chromosome Segregation.
The two chromosomes then attach themselves to different parts of the cell membrane.
Segregation or separation of the chromosomes occurs as they move to opposite ends of the cell during the cell separation process.
Step 3:
Separation.
A new cell membrane starts growing into the center of the cell, and the cytoplasm splits apart, forming two daughter cells.
