Techniques for calculation percent mass and percent volume solution concentrations are described.
Read pages 1-3 of the material on the link below and do the problems associated with that section.
Work the problems before checking the answers.
Why are the terms “concentrated” and “dilute” not very helpful?
When would you use volume percent calculations?
Why do you subtract the mass of the solute from the total mass desired when making mass percent calculations?
concentrated:
A solution that has a relatively large amount of dissolved solute.
concentration:
A measure of the amount of solute that has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent or solution.
dilute:
A solution that has a relatively small amount of dissolved solute.
Perform calculations involving molarity.
Molarity provides a method of quickly understanding how many molecules are present in solution
How many molecules can be found in a reaction?
Chemists deal with amounts of molecules every day.
Our reactions are described as so many molecules of compound A reacting with so many molecules of compound B to form so many molecules of compound C.
When we determine how much reagent to use, we need to know the number of molecules in a given volume of the reagent.
Percent solutions only tell us the number of grams, not molecules.
A 100 mL solution of 2% NaCl will have a very different number of molecules than a 2% solution of CsCl.
