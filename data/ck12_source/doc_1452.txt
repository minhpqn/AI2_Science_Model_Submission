Mineral Springs and Hot Springs
Some springs have water that contains minerals.
Groundwater dissolves minerals out of the rock as it seeps through the pores.
The water in some springs is hot because it is heated by hot magma.
Many hot springs are also mineral springs.
Thatâ€™s because hot water can dissolve more minerals than cold water.
Springs in Yellowstone National Park are hot and contain dissolved minerals.
Morning Glory Pool ( Figure below ) has a bright green color from dissolved minerals.
Along the edge are thick orange mats of bacteria.
The bacteria use the minerals in the hot water to make food.

Morning Glory Pool in Yellowstone National Park is a mineral spring.
Heated groundwater may become trapped in spaces within rocks.
Pressure builds up as more water seeps into the spaces.
When the pressure becomes great enough, the water bursts out of the ground at a crack or weak spot.
This is called a geyser .
When the water erupts from the ground, the pressure is released.
Then more water collects and the pressure builds up again.
This leads to another eruption.
Old Faithful ( Figure below ) is the best-known geyser in the world.
