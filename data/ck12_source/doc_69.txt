Describe the characteristics of jawless fish.
Name the two living groups of jawless fish.
What is this organism?
With this huge sucker lined with teeth, this organism might look like something out of science fiction.
But this is a real fish found in the ocean, known as a lamprey.
They use their teeth and sucker to bore into other fish and suck their blood.
The lamprey is an example of a jawless fish.
What defines a jawless fish?
You can probably guess.
A jawless fish is a fish without a jaw.
But there are other features that are shared by this class of organisms.
Why would such an organism evolve?
These fish were the first vertebrates to evolve.
Logically, this makes sense, in that the vertebral column would evolve first, with the more complex jaw bones evolving later.
The early jawless fish are thought to have relied on filter feeding to capture their food, and most likely would have sucked water and debris from the seafloor into their mouth, releasing water and waste out of their gills.
As other sea life evolved, these jawless fish began to feed on other fish species, and are now considered a pest in their habitat.
Lampreys have no natural predators.
