Conifers have their reproductive structures in cones, but they are not the only plants to have that trait ( Figure below ).
Conifer pollen cones are usually very small, while the seed cones are larger.
Pollen contains gametophytes that produce the male gamete of seed plants.
The pollen, which is a powder-like substance, is carried by the wind to fertilize the seed cones that contain the female gamete ( Figure below

Conifers have many uses.
They are important sources of lumber and are also used to make paper.
Resins, the sticky substance you might see oozing out of a wound on a pine tree, are collected from conifers to make a variety of products, such as the solvent turpentine and the rosin used by musicians and baseball players.
The sticky rosin improves the pitcherâ€™s hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and the strings to help create music from a violin or other stringed instrument.
Cycads , in the phylum Cycadophyta , are also gymnosperms.
They have large, finely-divided leaves and grow as short shrubs and trees in tropical regions.
Like conifers, they produce cones, but the seed cones and pollen cones are always on separate plants ( Figure below ).
One type of cycad, the Sago Palm, is a popular landscape plant.
During the Age of the Dinosaurs (about 65 to 200 million years ago), cycads were the dominant plants.
So you can imagine dinosaurs grazing on cycad seeds and roaming through cycad forests.
