Q:
What would happen to an atom’s charge if it were to gain extra electrons?
A:
If an atom were to gain extra electrons, it would have more electrons than protons.
This would give it a negative charge, so it would no longer be neutral.
Atoms to Ions
Atoms cannot only gain extra electrons.
They can also lose electrons.
In either case, they become ions .
Ions are atoms that have a positive or negative charge because they have unequal numbers of protons and electrons.
If atoms lose electrons, they become positive ions, or cations.
If atoms gain electrons, they become negative ions, or anions.
Consider the example of fluorine (see Figure below ).
A fluorine atom has nine protons and nine electrons, so it is electrically neutral.
If a fluorine atom gains an electron, it becomes a fluoride ion with an electric charge of -1.

Names and Symbols
Like fluoride, other negative ions usually have names ending in –ide .
Positive ions, on the other hand, are just given the element name followed by the word ion .
For example, when a sodium atom loses an electron, it becomes a positive sodium ion.
