Plates moving on a rounded surface experience stress.
Stress happens to rocks on a smaller scale, too.
Local movements can cause stress in rocks.
There are four types of stresses that affect rocks:
Confining stress comes from the weight of all the overlying rock.
This weight pushes down on a deeply buried rock.
The rock is being pushed in from all sides, which compresses it.
The rock will not deform because there is no place for it to move.
Compression stress squeezes rocks together.
Compression causes rocks to fold or fracture ( Figure below ).
When two cars collide, compression causes them to crumple.
Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries.

Tension stress pulls rocks apart.
Tension causes rocks to lengthen or break apart.
Tension is the major type of stress found at divergent plate boundaries.
Shear stress happens when forces slide past each other in opposite directions ( Figure below ).
This is the most common stress found at transform plate boundaries.
