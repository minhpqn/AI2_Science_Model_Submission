When gas particles collide with objects it produces gas pressure.
Define atmospheric pressure.
Describe how atmospheric pressure changes with elevation above sea level.
Describe the use of a barometer.
A large difference in pressure between two areas is an important criterion for generating storm reports
What do storm reports inform people of?
The pressure in the atmosphere is an important factor in determining what the weather will be like.
If the barometric pressure is high in an area, this will cause air to move to a region of lower pressure.
The greater the difference in pressure between the two areas, the stronger the winds will develop.
Under certain conditions, the winds can produce a tornado (a violent rotating column of air that reaches from a thunderstorm down to the ground).
Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by gas particles in Earthâ€™s atmosphere as those particles collide with objects.
A barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure.
A traditional mercury barometer consists of an evacuated tube immersed in a container of mercury.
Air molecules push down on the surface of the mercury.
Because the inside of the tube is a vacuum, the mercury rises inside the tube.
The height to which the mercury rises is dependent on the external air pressure.
A barometer measures the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere
(A) A barometer measures atmospheric pressure as the height of a column of mercury. (B) A modern aneroid barometer in the form of a dial is used by meteorologists to help them predict upcoming weather.
A more convenient barometer, called an aneroid barometer , measures pressure by the expansion and contraction of a small spring within an evacuated metal capsule.
