Explain how radioactive decay changes one element to another.
Outline the dangers of radioactive decay.
This diagram could almost illustrate a pinball game.
It actually illustrates the process of radioactive decay.
This is a process that occurs all around you.
It may even occur inside your body.
Q:
Based on the diagram, what happens during radioactive decay?
A:
The nucleus of a radioactive atom gives off radiation in the form of energy and a particle of matter.
Introducing Radioactive Decay
Radioactive decay is the process in which the nuclei of radioactive atoms emit charged particles and energy, which are called by the general term radiation .
Radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei, and when the nuclei emit radiation, they become more stable.
Radioactive decay is a nuclear—rather than chemical—reaction because it involves only the nuclei of atoms.
In a nuclear reaction, one element may change into another.

Types of Radioactive Decay
There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay.
In all three types, nuclei emit radiation, but the nature of the radiation differs.
The Table below shows the radiation emitted in each type of decay.
