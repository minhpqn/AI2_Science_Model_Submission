With higher frequencies, they also have more energy.
That’s why microwaves are useful for heating food in microwave ovens.
Microwaves have other important uses as well, including cell phone transmissions and radar.
These uses are described below.

Cell phone signals are carried through the air as microwaves.
You can see how this works in the Figure below .
A cell phone encodes the sounds of the caller’s voice in microwaves by changing the frequency of the waves.
This is called frequency modulation.
The encoded microwaves are then sent from the phone through the air to a cell tower.
From the cell tower, the waves travel to a switching center.
From there they go to another cell tower and from the tower to the receiver of the person being called.
The receiver changes the encoded microwaves back to sounds.

Q:
Cell towers reach high above the ground.
Why do you think such tall towers are used?
A:
Microwaves can be interrupted by buildings and other obstructions, so cell towers must be placed high above the ground to prevent the interruption of cell phone signals.
