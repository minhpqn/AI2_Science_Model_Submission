Our modern understanding of DNA and chromosomes helped to explain how Mendel's rules worked.
Mendel laid the foundation for modern genetics, but there were still a lot of questions he left unanswered.
What exactly are the dominant and recessive factors that determine how all organisms look?
And how do these factors work?
Since Mendel’s time, scientists have discovered the answers to these questions.
Genetic material is made out of DNA .
It is the DNA that makes up the hereditary factors that Mendel identified.
By applying our modern knowledge of DNA and chromosomes, we can explain Mendel’s findings and build on them.
In this concept, we will explore the connections between Mendel’s work and modern genetics.
Traits, Genes, and Alleles
Recall that our DNA is wound into chromosomes .
Each of our chromosomes contains a long chain of DNA that encodes hundreds, if not thousands, of genes.
Each of these genes can have slightly different versions from individual to individual.
These variants of genes are called alleles .
Each parent only donates one allele for each gene to an offspring.
For example, remember that for the height gene in pea plants there are two possible factors.
These factors are alleles.
There is a dominant allele for tallness (T) and a recessive allele for shortness (t) .
Genotype and Phenotype
Genotype is a way to describe the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene ( Table below ).
