The term saturated refers to the placement of hydrogen atoms around the carbon atoms.
In a saturated fatty acid , all the carbon atoms (other than the carbon in the -COOH group) are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible (usually two hydrogens).
Saturated fatty acids do not contain any other groups except the -COOH.
This is why they form straight chains, as shown in Figure below .
Because of this structure, saturated fatty acids can be packed together very tightly.
This allows organisms to store chemical energy very densely.
The fatty tissues of animals contain mainly saturated fatty acids.
Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids.
Saturated fatty acids include arachidic, stearic, and palmitic fatty acids.
Unsaturated fatty acids include all the other fatty acids in the figure.
Notice how all the unsaturated fatty acids have bent chains, whereas the saturated fatty acids have straight chains.
In an unsaturated fatty acid , some carbon atoms are not bonded to the maximum number of hydrogen atoms.
This is because they are bonded to one or more additional groups, including double and triple bonds between carbons.
Wherever these other groups bind with carbon, they cause the chain to bend - they do not form straight chains ( Figure above ).
This gives unsaturated fatty acids different properties than saturated fatty acids.
For example, unsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature whereas saturated fatty acids are solids.
Unsaturated fatty acids are found mainly in plants, especially in fatty tissues such as nuts and seeds.
Unsaturated fatty acids occur naturally in the bent shapes shown in Figure above .
However, unsaturated fatty acids can be artificially manufactured to have straight chains like saturated fatty acids.
Called trans fatty acids , these synthetic lipids were commonly added to foods until it was found that they increased the risk for certain health problems.
