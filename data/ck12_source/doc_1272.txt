As you would expect, where plates collide there are lots of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The subducting oceanic plate melts as it reenters the mantle.
The magma rises and erupts.
This creates a volcanic mountain range near the coast of the continent.
This range is called a continental arc .
The Andes Mountains, along the western edge of South America, are a volcanic arc ( Figure below ).

The Andes Mountains line the western edge of South America.
Two oceanic plates may collide.
In this case, the older plate is denser.
This plate subducts beneath the younger plate.
As the subducting plate is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts.
The magma this creates rises and erupts.
This forms a line of volcanoes, known as an island arc ( Figure below ).
Japan, Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are examples of island arcs ( Figure below ).
Diagram of a convergent plate boundary between two ocean plates
A convergent plate boundary subduction zone between two plates of oceanic lithosphere.
Melting of the subducting plate causes volcanic activity and earthquakes.
Japan is an island arc that lies at the intersection of the North American, Filipino, and Eurasian plates
