Active transport in which solutes are moved against their concentration gradients; fueled by ATP.
redox energy :
Energy that is either stored or released by redox reactions.
secondary active transport :
Active transport in which one substance moves along its electrochemical gradient, allowing a different substance to move against its own electrochemical gradient; also known as cotransport.
symport :
The secondary active transport process of transporting two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in the same direction.
symporter :
An integral membrane protein involved in secondary active transport; transports two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in the same direction.
Active transport moves molecules across a cell membrane from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.
Active transport requires the use of energy.
The active transport of small molecules or ions across a cell membrane is generally carried out by transport proteins that are found in the membrane.
During antiport and symport two substances are cotransported.
