Trophic Levels and Biomass
With less energy at higher trophic levels, there are usually fewer organisms as well.
Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels, but their smaller numbers result in less biomass.
Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a trophic level.
The decrease in biomass from lower to higher levels is also represented by Figure above .
The different feeding positions in a food chain or web are called trophic levels.
Generally, there are no more than four trophic levels because energy and biomass decrease from lower to higher levels.
