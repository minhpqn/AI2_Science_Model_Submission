Water on Earth

When astronauts see Earth from space, this is how it looks.
Notice how blue the planet appears.
That’s because oceans cover much of Earth’s surface.
The water in those oceans is in constant motion.
Water is also found in the clouds that rise above the planet and travel across the sky.
The water may precipitate out as rain or snow.
