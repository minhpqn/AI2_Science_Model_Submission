Communications satellites are often placed in these orbits.
Types of Satellites
The first artificial satellite was launched just over 50 years ago.
Thousands are now in orbit around Earth.
Satellites also orbit the Moon, the Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
Satellites have many different purposes.
There are satellites for communications and navigation.
There are satellites for taking pictures of a planet's surface.
Dozens of satellites collect data about Earth.
NASA’s Landsat satellites make detailed images of Earth’s continents and coastal areas.
Other satellites study the oceans, atmosphere, polar ice sheets, and other Earth systems.
This data helps us to monitor climate change.
Other long-term changes in the planet are also best seen from space.
Satellite images help scientists understand how Earth’s systems affect one another.
Different satellites monitor different wavelengths of energy.
Humans have a presence in space at the International Space Station (ISS) ( Figure below ).
Modern space stations are constructed piece by piece to create a modular system.
The primary purpose of the ISS is scientific research, especially in medicine, biology, and physics.
The International Space Station
A photograph of the International Space Station was taken from the space shuttle Atlantis in June 2007.
