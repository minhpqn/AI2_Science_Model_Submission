Pigments of these colors are often made with a dichromate salt (usually sodium or potassium dichromate).
These brightly colored compounds serve as strong oxidizing agents in chemical reactions.
Balancing Redox Equations:
Half-Reaction Method
Another method for balancing redox reactions uses half-reactions.
Recall that a half-reaction is either the oxidation or reduction that occurs, treated separately.
The half-reaction method works better than the oxidation-number method when the substances in the reaction are in aqueous solution.
The aqueous solution is typically either acidic or basic, so hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions are present.
In general, the half-reactions are first balanced by atoms separately.
Electrons are included in the half-reactions.
These are then balanced so that the number of electrons lost is equal to the number of electrons gained.
Finally, the two half-reactions are added back together.
The example is the oxidation of Fe 2+ ions to Fe 3+ ions by dichromate (Cr 2 O 7 2âˆ’ ) in acidic solution.
The dichromate ions are reduced to Cr 3+ ions.
Potassium dichromate is a bright red-orange compound
Potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 )
Step 1:
Write the unbalanced ionic equation .
\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq)+\text{Cr}_2\text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+}(aq)+\text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)
Notice that the equation is far from balanced, as there are no oxygen atoms on the right side.
