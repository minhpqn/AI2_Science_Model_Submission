Major organs of most plants include roots, stems, and leaves.
Roots are important organs in all vascular plants.
Most vascular plants have two types of roots: primary roots that grow downward and secondary roots that branch out to the side.
Together, all the roots of a plant make up a root system .
There are two basic types of root systems in plants: taproot systems and fibrous root systems.
Both are illustrated in Figure below .
Taproot systems feature a single, thick primary root, called the taproot , with smaller secondary roots growing out from the sides.
The taproot may penetrate as many as 60 meters (almost 200 feet) below the ground surface.
It can plumb very deep water sources and store a lot of food to help the plant survive drought and other environmental extremes.
The taproot also anchors the plant very securely in the ground.
Fibrous root systems have many small branching roots, called fibrous roots , but no large primary root.
The huge number of threadlike roots increases the surface area for absorption of water and minerals, but fibrous roots anchor the plant less securely.
Taproot versus fibrous root system
Dandelions have taproot systems; grasses have fibrous root systems.
Root Structures and Functions
As shown in Figure below , the tip of a root is called the root cap .
It consists of specialized cells that help regulate primary growth of the root at the tip.
Above the root cap is primary meristem, where growth in length occurs.
Parts of a root
A root is a complex organ consisting of several types of tissue.
