A scientist who specializes in research with the use of microscopes.
microscopy :
The scientific field of using microscopes to view samples and objects that cannot be seen with the unaided eye.
optical microscope :
A microscope that uses visible light and lenses to magnify objects.
organelle :
A structure within the cytoplasm of a cell; may be enclosed within a membrane; performs a specific function.
resolution :
A measure of the clarity of an image; the minimum distance that two points can be separated by and still be distinguished as two separate points.
scanning electron microscope (SEM) :
Electron microscope that scans an electron beam over the surface of an object; measures how many electrons are scattered back.
transmission electron microscope (TEM) :
Electron microscope that shoots electrons through the sample; measures how the electron beam changes because it is scattered in the sample.
The development of light microscopes and later electron microscopes helped scientists learn about the cell.
Early light microscopes had poor resolution and a magnification power of only about 10 times.
Electron microscopes have much higher resolution and magnification; they have been used to produce images of molecules and atoms.
Many of the discoveries about cell structure since the 1950s have been made with the use of electron microscopes.
