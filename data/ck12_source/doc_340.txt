Structure of Bones
Bones come in many different shapes and sizes, but they are all made of the same materials.
Bones are organs, and recall that organs are made up of two or more types of tissues.
The two main types of bone tissue are compact bone and spongy bone ( Figure below ).
Compact bone makes up the dense outer layer of bones.
Spongy bone is found at the center of the bone and is lighter and more porous than compact bone.
Bones look tough, shiny, and white because they are covered by a layer called the periosteum .
Many bones also contain a soft connective tissue called bone marrow in the pores of the spongy bone.
Bone marrow is where blood cells are made.
Bones are made up of different types of tissues
Bones are made up of different types of tissues.
Early in human development, the skeleton consists of only cartilage and other connective tissues.
At this point, the skeleton is very flexible.
As the fetus develops, hard bone begins to replace the cartilage, and the skeleton begins to harden.
Not all of the cartilage, however, is replaced by bone.
Cartilage remains in many places in your body, including your joints, your rib cage, your ears, and the tip of your nose.
A baby is born with zones of cartilage in its bones that allow growth of the bones.
These areas, called growth plates , allow the bones to grow longer as the child grows.
By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone.
