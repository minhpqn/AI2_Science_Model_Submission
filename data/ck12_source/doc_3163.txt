Unlike most other home appliances, a refrigerator generally runs nonstop every day of the year.
Can you think of another home appliance that gets such constant use?
Purpose of a Cooling System
A refrigerator is an example of a cooling system.
Another example is an air conditioner.
The purpose of any cooling system is to transfer thermal energy in order to keep things cool.
A refrigerator, for example, transfers thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen.
If youâ€™ve ever noticed how warm the back of a running refrigerator gets, then you know that it releases a lot of thermal energy into the room.
Q:
Thermal energy always moves from a warmer area to a cooler area.
How can thermal energy move from the cooler air inside a refrigerator to the warmer air in a room?
A:
The answer is work.
How a Refrigerator Works
A refrigerator must do work to reverse the normal direction of thermal energy flow.
Work involves the use of force to move something, and doing work takes energy.
In a refrigerator, the energy is usually provided by electricity.
You can read in detail in the Figure below how a refrigerator does its work.
