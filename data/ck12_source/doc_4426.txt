Give examples of monotremes.
Describe monotreme reproduction.
Can a mammal lay an egg?
This is a mammal.
But it is unlike placental or marsupial mammals.
If a mammal does not develop within a placenta or a pouch, what type of development is left?
Eggs!
Only five living species of mammals are not therian mammals.
They are called monotremes.
Monotremes are mammals that reproduce by laying eggs.
The only living monotreme species are the platypus and echidnas (see Figure below and Figure below ).
They are found solely in Australia and New Guinea (an island not far from Australia).
This egg-laying, venomous, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal is a platypus, a monotreme mammal that reproduces by laying eggs.
Like the platypus, the echidna is a monotreme.
The only living monotreme species inhabit Australia and New Guinea.
Eggs and Lactation in Monotremes
Female monotremes lack a uterus and vagina.
Instead, they have a cloaca with one opening, like the cloacas of reptiles and birds.
The opening is used to excrete wastes as well as lay eggs.
Monotreme eggs have a leathery shell, like the eggs of reptiles.
