Are your blood vessels leaky?
None of your blood vessels are leaking this badly, or you'd be in the hospital!
But your blood vessels do leak a little bit.
Water and solutes pass out of the blood vessels and help form the fluid that bathes your body's tissues.
Ultimately the fluid that is lost from the blood vessels is returned through the lymphatic system.
The Lymphatic System and Circulation
The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and tissues that carry a clear fluid called lymph.
The lymphatic system ( Figure below ) spreads all around the body and filters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells, or pathogens.
