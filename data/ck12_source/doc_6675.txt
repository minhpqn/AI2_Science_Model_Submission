The Big Idea
One dimensional motion describes objects moving in straight lines.
Speed is a scalar measure of how quickly an object is moving along this line.
Velocity is speed with a direction, making it a vector.
If an object’s velocity changes with time, the object is said to be accelerating.
When restricted to one dimension, there are only two possible directions for the velocity and acceleration vectors to point in.
As we’ll see in the next chapters, understanding an object's acceleration is the key to understanding its motion.
Position and Displacement
Explain the meaning of an object's position and the difference between distance and displacement.
Create and understand basic position vs. time graphs.
Students will learn the meaning of an object's position, the difference between distance and displacement and some basic graphing of position vs. time.
\text{Symbols}\begin{cases}\Delta \text{(anything)} & \text{Final value - initial value}\\\\text{anything}_0 & \text{Value at time 0}\end{cases}
\text{Scalors}\begin{cases}t & \text{Time in seconds, s}\\\d = |{\Delta x_1}| + |{\Delta x_2}| & \text{Distance (in meters, m}\text{)}\\\v = |{v}| & \text{Speed (in meters per second,}\ \text{m}/\text{s}\text{)}\end{cases}
\text{Vectors}\begin{cases}x = x(t) & \text{Position} \\\\Delta x = x_f-x_i & \text{Displacement}\\\\end{cases}
When beginning a one dimensional problem, define a positive direction.
The other direction is then taken to be negative.
Traditionally, "positive" is taken to mean "to the right"; however, any definition of direction used consistently throughout the problem will yield the right answer.
Guidance Position is the location of the object (whether it's a person, a ball or a particle) at a given moment in time.
Displacement is the difference in the object's position from one time to another.
Distance is the total amount the object has traveled in a certain period of time.
