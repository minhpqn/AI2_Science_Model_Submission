If the materials are toxic, they may cause pollution.

The Three “R”s
You probably already know about the three “R”s.
They stand for reduce, reuse, and recycle.
The third “R”—recycle—has caught on in a big way.
That’s because it’s easy.
There are thousands of places to drop off items such as aluminum cans for recycling.
Many cities allow you to just put your recycling in a special can and put it at the curb.
We haven’t done as well with the first two “R”s—reducing and reusing.
But they aren’t always as easy as recycling.
Recycling is better than making things from brand new materials.
But it still takes some resources to turn recycled items into new ones.
It takes no resources at all to reuse items or not buy them in the first place.
Reducing resource use means just what it says—using fewer resources.
There are lots of ways to reduce our use of resources.
Buy durable goods.
Choose items that are well made so they will last longer.
