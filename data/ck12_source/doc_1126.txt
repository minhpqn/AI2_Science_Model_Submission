Since Galileo, people can look through a telescope and see that the planets orbit around the Sun.
These bodies—the Sun and each of the planets—are round.
If Earth is a planet, it is certainly round.
Another way to tell that Earth is round is to look at ships sailing off into the distance.
What do you see when you watch a tall ship sail over the horizon of the Earth?
The bottom part of the ship disappears faster than the top part ( Figure below ).
What would that ship look like if Earth were flat?
No part of it would disappear before the other.
It would all just get smaller as it moved farther away.
Earth's curvature can be seen when objects are below the horizon
Earth’s curvature is noticeable when objects at a distance are below the arc.
Earth is a sphere (technically, an oblate spheroid, a bit squashed at the poles).
As a sphere, it can be divided.
Half of a sphere is a hemisphere .
Earth is divided into hemispheres: north, south, east, west ( Figure below ).
Remember that the Equator is the line that falls at 0°.
North of the Equator is the Northern Hemisphere .
South of the Equator is the Southern Hemisphere .
The North Pole is at 90°N.
So there are 90 degree lines in the Northern Hemisphere.
