Some carbonate minerals are very common.
Calcite contains calcium, carbon, and oxygen.
Have you ever been in a limestone cave or seen a marble tile?
Calcite is in both limestone and marble.
Azurite and malachite are also carbonate minerals.
They contain copper instead of calcium.
They are not as common as calcite.
Malachite and azurite are used in jewelry; as you can see, they are very colorful ( Figure below
Azurite, malachite, and rhodochrosite are carbonate minerals
(a) The deep blue mineral is azurite and the green is malachite. (b) This red rhodochrosite is a carbonate mineral.
Rhodochrosite is usually pink; the red crystals are rare.
Halide minerals are salts.
They form when salt water evaporates.
This mineral class includes more than just table salt.
Halide minerals may contain the elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine.
Some halide minerals combine with metal elements.
Common table salt is a halide mineral that contains the elements chlorine and sodium.
Fluorite is a type of halide that contains fluorine and calcium.
Fluorite can be found in many colors.
If you shine an ultraviolet light on fluorite, it will glow!
