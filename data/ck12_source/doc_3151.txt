Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a fluid (either a gas or a liquid).
Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat.
Convection is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred (the other ways are conduction and thermal radiation).
Thermal energy is always transferred from matter with a higher temperature to matter with a lower temperature.
How Does Convection Occur?
The Figure below shows how convection occurs, using hot water in a pot as an example.
When particles in one area of a fluid (in this case, the water at the bottom of the pot) gain thermal energy, they move more quickly, have more collisions, and spread farther apart.
This decreases the density of the particles, so they rise up through the fluid.
As they rise, they transfer their thermal energy to other particles of the fluid and cool off in the process.
With less energy, the particles move more slowly, have fewer collisions, and move closer together.
This increases their density, so they sink back down through the fluid.
When they reach the bottom of the fluid, the cycle repeats.
The result is a loop of moving particles called a convection current .
You can learn more about convection currents by watching the cartoon video called “Convection” at this URL:

Examples of Convection
Convection currents transfer thermal energy through many fluids, not just hot water in a pot.
For example, convection currents transfer thermal energy through molten rock below Earth’s surface, through water in the oceans, and through air in the atmosphere.
Convection currents in the atmosphere create winds.
You can see one way this happens in the Figure below .
