Living organisms obtain chemical energy in one of two ways.
Autotrophs, shown in the Figure below , store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they produce themselves.
Food is chemical energy stored in organic molecules.
Food provides both the energy to do work and the carbon to build the organic structures from cells to organisms.
Because most autotrophs transform sunlight to make or synthesize food, we call the process they use photosynthesis .
The food produced via this process is glucose.
Only three groups of organisms - plants, algae, and some bacteria - are capable of this life-giving energy transformation.
Autotrophs make food for their own use, but they make enough to support other life as well.
Almost all other organisms depend absolutely on these three groups for the food they produce.
The producers , as autotrophs are also known, begin food chains which feed all life.
Food chains will be discussed in the Ecology concepts.
Photosynthetic autotrophs, which make food for more than 99% of the organisms on earth, include only three groups of organisms: plants such as the redwood tree (a), algae such as kelp (b), and certain bacteria like this Anabaena (c).
Heterotrophs cannot make their own food, so they must eat or absorb it.
For this reason, heterotrophs are also known as consumers .
Consumers include all animals and fungi and many protists and bacteria.
They consume either autotrophs or other heterotrophs.
Heterotrophs show great diversity and may appear far more fascinating than producers.
But heterotrophs are limited by their utter dependence on those autotrophs which originally made the food.
If plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria vanished from Earth, animals, fungi, and other heterotrophs would soon disappear as well.
All life requires a constant input of energy.
