What is the definition of electrical power?
What happens to the electrical energy that is not converted into work?
Instruction and practice problems related to the energy delivered by an electric circuit:
A 2-way light bulb for a 110.
V lamp has filament that uses power at a rate of 50.0 W and another filament that uses power at a rate of 100.
W.
Find the resistance of these two filaments.
Find the power dissipation of a 1.5 A lamp operating on a 12 V battery.
A high voltage  (4.0 \times 10^5 \ V) power transmission line delivers electrical energy from a generating station to a substation at a rate of 1.5 \times 10^9 \ W .
What is the current in the lines?
A toaster oven indicates that it operates at 1500 W on a 110 V circuit.
What is the resistance of the oven?
electrical energy:
Energy is the ability to do work, so electrical energy is the work done by an electrical circuit.
kilowatt hour:
An amount of energy equal to 3.6 \times 10^6 \ \text{Joules} .
