Look at Carson’s brother Colton in the Figure below .
He’s getting his scooter started by pushing off with his foot.
The force he applies to the ground with his foot starts the scooter moving in the opposite direction.
The harder he pushes against the ground, the faster the scooter will go.

How much an object accelerates when a force is applied to it depends not only on the strength of the force but also on the object’s mass.
For example, a heavier scooter would be harder to accelerate.
Colton would have to push with more force to start it moving and move it faster.
You can explore the how force, mass, and acceleration are related by doing the activity at this URL:
Q :
What units do you think are used to measure force?
A :
The SI unit for force is the Newton (N).
A Newton is the force needed to cause a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate at 1 m/s 2 , so a Newton equals 1 kg • m/s 2 .
The Newton was named for the scientist Sir Isaac Newton, who is famous for his laws of motion and gravity.
Force as a Vector
Force is a vector, or a measure that has both size and direction.
For example, Colton pushes on the ground in the opposite direction that the scooter moves, so that’s the direction of the force he is applies.
He can give the scooter a strong push or a weak push.
That’s the size of the force.
