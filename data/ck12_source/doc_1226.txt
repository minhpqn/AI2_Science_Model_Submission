The sediments are eventually dropped, or deposited , somewhere.
This process is called sedimentation .
The sediments may then be compacted and cemented together.
This forms a sedimentary rock.
This whole process can take hundreds or thousands of years.
Metamorphism.
This long word means “to change form.“ A rock undergoes metamorphism if it is exposed to extreme heat and pressure within the crust.
With metamorphism , the rock does not melt all the way.
The rock changes due to heat and pressure.
A metamorphic rock may have a new mineral composition and/or texture.
An interactive rock cycle diagram can be found here:
The rock cycle really has no beginning or end.
It just continues.
The processes involved in the rock cycle take place over hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years.
Even though for us rocks are solid and unchanging, they slowly change all the time.
The three main rock types are igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary.
The three processes that change one rock to another are crystallization, metamorphism, and erosion and sedimentation.
Any rock can transform into any other rock by passing through one or more of these processes.
This creates the rock cycle.
