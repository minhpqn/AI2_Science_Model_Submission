Explain how transmission of fluid pressure is used in brakes and other equipment.
Did you ever watch someone make balloon animals like this turkey?
When you blow up a balloon, you force air inside the balloon through a small opening.
The air spreads out and presses against the inside of the balloon, forcing it to expand.
Pressure always spreads throughout a contained fluid like air in a balloon.
Pressure and Force
Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area.
It is represented by the equation:
The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied or if the same force is applied over a smaller area.
The equation for pressure can be rewritten as:
Force = Pressure × Area
This equation shows that the same pressure applied to a greater area increases the force.
Pascal and His Law
Some of the earliest scientific research on pressure in fluids was conducted by a French mathematician and physicist named Blaise Pascal (1623–1662).
The SI unit of pressure, the Pascal (Pa), is named for him because of his important research.
