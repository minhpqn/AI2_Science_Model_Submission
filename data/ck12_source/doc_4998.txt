What is wrong with the following chemical equation?
How could you fix it?
CH 4 + O 2 → CO 2 + 2H 2 O
What type of reaction is represented by the following chemical equation?
Explain your answer. 2Na + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H 2
Chemical Reactions and Energy - Advanced
Explain the role of energy in chemical reactions, and define activation energy.
How do you change one thing into another?
The bonds between the atoms need to be rearranged.
That is the definition of a chemical reaction.
And all chemical sections need energy to get started.
Chemical Reactions and Energy
All chemical reactions involve energy.
Some chemical reactions consume energy, whereas other chemical reactions release energy.
Chemical reactions can be either spontaneous, which do not require an input of energy, or non-spontaneous, which does require an input of some type of energy.
Energy may be in the form of heat, light or electricity.
Each of the energy changes that occur during a reaction are graphed in Figure below .
In the reaction on the left, energy is released.
In the reaction on the right, energy is consumed.
