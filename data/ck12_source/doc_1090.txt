How do you know that there's a crater at the top of the volcano rather than a peak?
What is the purpose of a topographic map?
What is a contour line?
What is a contour interval?
What will a hill look like on a topographic map?
How will a basin look different from a hill?
How do contour lines indicate a steep slope?
How do they indicate a stream?
Why might a geologic map be useful to geologists?
Explain bathymetric maps.
Describe ways scientists learn about the deep ocean.
Is it true that we know more about the dark side of the Moon than we do about the oceans?
It's true!
Why do you think so?
The oceans are deep, dark, and frigid.
All but the very top surface is under extraordinarily high pressure.
It's hard to imagine an environment that's less hospitable to human life!
Yet, as you will see, we know quite a bit about the oceans.
This is due mostly to technology.
Rovers, like the one pictured above, allow scientists to remotely visit places that are too inhospitable for human life.
