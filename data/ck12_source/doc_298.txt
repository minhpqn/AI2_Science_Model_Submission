The performerâ€™s feet touch the ground 9.00 m below where the rope is tied.
How fast is the performer moving at the bottom of the arc?
A skier starts from rest at the top of a 45.0 m hill, coasts down a  30^\circ slope into a valley, and continues up to the top of a 40.0 m hill.  Both hill heights are measured from the valley floor.  Assume the skier puts no effort into the motion (always coasting) and there is no friction.
How fast will the skier be moving on the valley floor?
How fast will the skier be moving on the top of the 40.0 m hill?
A 2.00 kg ball is thrown upward at some unknown angle from the top of a 20.0 m high building.
If the initial magnitude of the velocity of the ball is 20.0 m/s, what is the magnitutde of the final velocity when it strikes the ground?
Ignore air resistance.
If a 2.00 kg ball is thrown straight upward with a KE of 500 J, what maximum height will it reach?
Neglect air resistance.
conservation of energy:
An empirical law of physics (meaning it cannot be derived), states that the total amount of energy within an isolated system is constant.
Although energy can be transformed from one form into another, energy cannot be created or destroyed
closed system:
Means it cannot exchange any of heat, work, or matter with the surroundings.
mechanical energy:
The sum of potential energy and kinetic energy.
Elastic and Inelastic Collisions
Describe the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions and indicate what is conserved in each case.
Solve problems involving elastic collisions using both the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy.
