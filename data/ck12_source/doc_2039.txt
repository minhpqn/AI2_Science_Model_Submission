How about if you visited the Mesozoic?
The planet would look a lot more like it does today.
Animals would fill the niches you're used to seeing animals fill.
But the animals would be mostly reptiles.
So things wouldn't be so familiar after all.
The Mesozoic Era
The Paleozoic ended with a mass extinction.
This left lots of habitats available for new organisms.
Adaptive radiation by reptiles filled these habitats.
The Mesozoic Era was the age of reptiles.
The planet was generally warmer than it is now.
This climate was very good for reptiles.
Reptiles developed adaptations for living away from water.
Their thick skin keeps them from drying out.
The evolution of the amniote egg allowed them to lay their eggs on dry land.
The amniote egg has a shell and contains all the nutrients and water required for the developing embryo ( Figure below ).

Earth in the Mesozoic was populated by an enormous diversity of reptiles.
Most of the reptiles were dinosaurs.
