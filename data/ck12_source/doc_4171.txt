Describe two adaptations of desert plants to conserve water.
What are the three largest families of flowering plants?
Describe the male and female reproductive structures of flowers.
State how fruits help flowering plants reproduce.
Explain how flowering plants and their animal pollinators co-evolved.
Describe plant cell structures, and list types of plant cells.
Explain the roles of the central vacuole, cell wall, and chloroplast.
Why do plant cells look like little rectangles?
A section of a pine embryo.
Notice how all the cells seem to stack on each other, with no spaces in between.
MIght this allow the cells to form structures that can grow upright?
Organs in Plants?
Your body includes organ systems, such as the digestive system, made of individual organs, such as the stomach, liver, and pancreas, which work together to carry out a certain function (in this case, breaking down and absorbing food).
These organs, in turn, are made of different kinds of tissues, which are groups of cells which work together to perform a specific job.
For example, your stomach is made of muscle tissue to facilitate movement and glandular tissue to secrete enzymes for chemical breakdown of food molecules.
These tissues, in turn, are made of cells specialized in shape, size, and component organelles, such as mitochondria for energy and microtubules for movement.
Plants, too, are made of organs, which in turn are made of tissues.
Plant tissues, like ours, are constructed of specialized cells, which in turn contain specific organelles.
It is these cells, tissues, and organs that carry out the dramatic lives of plants.
Plant cells resemble other eukaryotic cells in many ways.
