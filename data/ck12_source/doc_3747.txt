Regulation of transcription
Regulation of Transcription.
Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements to control transcription.
The regulatory elements are embedded within the DNA.
Gene transcription is controlled by regulatory proteins that bind to regulatory elements on DNA.
The proteins usually either activate or repress transcription.
