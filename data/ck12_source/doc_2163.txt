What can you see during a solar eclipse?
A solar eclipse is kind of like a field trip to the Sun from Earth.
You can see something (with special tinted glasses) that you don't usually see.
The Sun has a remarkable ring of light around it.
This is the corona.
If you have a chance to see a solar eclipse, you should do it.
The Outer Layers
The three outer layers of the Sun are its atmosphere.
The layers are, from inside to outside, the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona.
The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun ( Figure below ).
It's the part that we see shining.
