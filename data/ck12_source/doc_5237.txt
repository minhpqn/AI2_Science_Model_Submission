Heterozygous or Homozygous?
If a person is homozygous or heterozygous for the dominant allele of a trait, they will have that trait.
If the person is heterozygous for a recessive allele of the trait, they will not show the trait.
A person who is heterozygous for a recessive allele of a trait is called a carrier .
Only people who are homozygous for a recessive allele of a trait will have the trait.

autosome :
Any chromosome other than a sex chromosome; chromosomes 1-22 in humans; unrelated to sex determination.
carrier :
A person who is heterozygous for a recessive allele of a trait.
pedigree :
A chart which shows the inheritance of a trait over several generations; a representation of genetic inheritance.
sex chromosome :
A chromosome that determines the sex of an organism; in humans, the X and Y chromosomes.
sex-linked trait :
A trait whose allele is found on a sex chromosome.
A pedigree can help geneticists discover if a trait, characteristic, or disease is inherited in a sex-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive fashion.
