This little girl just got her first scraped knee.
It doesn’t seem to hurt, but the break in her skin could let pathogens enter her body.
That’s why scrapes should be kept clean and protected until they heal.
The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response.
If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful.
These are signs of inflammation.
Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries.
Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged.
The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand.
This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.
The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.
White Blood Cells
What do these white blood cells do at the site of inflammation?
The main role of white blood cells is to fight pathogens in the body.
There are actually several different kinds of white blood cells.
Some white blood cells have very specific functions.
They attack only certain pathogens.
Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they find.
These white blood cells travel to areas of the body that are inflamed.
They are called phagocytes , which means “eating cells.” Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte.
