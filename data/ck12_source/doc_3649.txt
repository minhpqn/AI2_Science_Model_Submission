However, it wasn’t until the experiments of Gregor Mendel that scientists understood how characteristics are inherited.
Mendel’s discoveries formed the basis of genetics , the science of heredity.
That’s why Mendel is often called the "father of genetics." It’s not common for a single researcher to have such an important impact on science.
The importance of Mendel’s work was due to three things: a curious mind, sound scientific methods, and good luck.
You’ll see why when you read about Mendel’s experiments.

Gregor Mendel was born in 1822 and grew up on his parents’ farm in Austria.
He did well in school and became a monk.
He also went to the University of Vienna, where he studied science and math.
His professors encouraged him to learn science through experimentation and to use math to make sense of his results.
Mendel is best known for his experiments with the pea plant Pisum sativum (see Figure below ).

The Austrian monk Gregor Mendel experimented with pea plants.
He did all of his research in the garden of the monastery where he lived.
Blending Theory of Inheritance
During Mendel’s time, the blending theory of inheritance was popular.
This is the theory that offspring have a blend, or mix, of the characteristics of their parents.
