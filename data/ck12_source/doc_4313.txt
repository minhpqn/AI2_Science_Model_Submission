Insects generally have two pairs of wings for flight.
Wings are part of the exoskeleton and attached to the thorax.
Insect wings show a lot of variation.
As you can see in Figure below , butterfly wings are paper-thin, whereas beetle wings are like armor.
Not all insect wings work the same way, either.
They differ in how the muscles are attached and whether the two pairs of wings work independently or together.
Besides flight, wings serve other functions.
They may protect the body (beetles), communicate visually with other insects (butterflies), or produce sounds to attract mates (katydids).

Form and Function in Insect Wings.
Beetles, butterflies, and katydids all have two pairs of wings that they use for flight.
However, the wings are very different because they have other functions as well.
Nearly all insects reproduce sexually.
Some can also reproduce asexually.
An example of an insect life cycle is shown in Figure below

Insect Life Cycle.
This diagram represents the life cycle of a mosquito.
Most insects have a similar life cycle.
When an insect egg hatches, a larva emerges.
