Scientists thought they had finally found them when John Dalton discovered the atom in 1803 (see the timeline in Table below ).
The word atom means “indivisible,” and Dalton thought that the atom could not be divided into smaller, simpler particles.

For almost 100 years after Dalton discovered atoms, they were accepted as the fundamental particles of matter.
But starting in the late 1890s with the discovery of electrons, particles smaller and simpler than atoms were identified.
Within a few decades, protons and neutrons were also discovered.
Ultimately, hundreds of subatomic particles were found.
You can learn how such tiny particles are discovered by watching the video at this URL:
Leptons and Quarks and Bosons, Oh My!
Today, scientists think that electrons truly are fundamental particles that cannot be broken down into smaller, simpler particles.
They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons.
Protons and neutrons, on the other hand, are no longer thought to be fundamental particles.
Instead, they are now thought to consist of smaller, simpler particles of matter called quarks.
Scientists theorize that leptons and quarks are held together by yet another type of fundamental particles called bosons.
All three types of fundamental particles—leptons, quarks, and bosons—are described below.
The following Figure below shows the variety of particles of each type.
Table of leptons, quarks, and bosons
There are six types of quarks .
In ordinary matter, virtually all quarks are of the types called up and down quarks.
All quarks have mass, and they have an electric charge of either +2/3 or -1/3.
