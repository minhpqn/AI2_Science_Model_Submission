A gene is made of DNA at and  .
List the research that determined that DNA is the genetic material.
What is transformation?
What happened to the R-strain bacteria when Avery and his colleagues inactivated DNA in the S strain bacteria?
DNA Structure and Replication
Summarize Chargaff’s rules.
Explain the findings of James Watson and Francis Crick.
Summarize the process of semi-conservative DNA replication.
How do these four structures form DNA?
In an extremely elegant model, that's how.
As you will soon see, the model predicts how the DNA sequence can code for proteins, and how the molecule can be replicated.
DNA Structure and Replication
Other important discoveries about DNA were made in the mid-1900s by Erwin Chargaff.
He studied DNA from many different species.
He was especially interested in the four different nitrogen bases of DNA: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) (see Figure below ).
Chargaff found that concentrations of the four bases differed from one species to another.
However, within each species, the concentration of adenine was always about the same as the concentration of thymine.
The same was true of the concentrations of guanine and cytosine.
These observations came to be known as Chargaff’s rules .
The significance of the rules would not be revealed until the structure of DNA was discovered.
