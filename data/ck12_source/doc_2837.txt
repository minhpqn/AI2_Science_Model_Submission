In this process, the nuclei give off energy and may also emit charged particles of matter.
Types of radioactive decay include alpha, beta, and gamma decay.
In alpha and beta decay, both particles and energy are emitted.
In gamma decay , only energy, in the form of gamma rays, is emitted.
Alpha and beta decay occur when a nucleus has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons.
When the nucleus emits a particle, it gains or loses one or two protons, so the atom becomes a different element.
Gamma decay, in contrast, occurs when a nucleus is in an excited state and has too much energy to be stable.
This often happens after alpha or beta decay has occurred.
Because only energy is emitted during gamma decay, the number of protons remains the same.
Therefore, an atom does not become a different element during this type of decay.
Q:
The Figure below shows how helium-3 (He-3) decays by emitting a gamma particle.
How can you tell that the atom is still the same element after gamma decay occurs?
A:
The nucleus of the atom has two protons (red) before the reaction occurs.
After the nucleus emits the gamma particle, it still has two protons, so the atom is still the same element.

Dangers of Gamma Radiation
Gamma rays are the most dangerous type of radiation.
They can travel farther and penetrate materials more deeply than can the charged particles emitted during alpha and beta decay.
