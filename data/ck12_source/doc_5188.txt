That is the key question.
Sexual Life Cycles
Eukaryotes have three different versions of the sexual life cycle : a haploid life cycle, a diploid life cycle, and a life cycle known as the alternation of generations ( Figure below ).
A life cycle is the span in the life of an organism from one generation to the next.
All species that reproduce sexually follow a basic pattern, alternating between haploid and diploid chromosome numbers.
The sexual life cycle depends on when meiosis occurs and the type of cell that undergoes meiosis.

Haploid Life Cycles
The haploid life cycle is the simplest life cycle.
Organisms with this life cycle, such as many protists and some fungi and algae, spend the majority of their life cycle as a haploid cell.
In fact, the zygote is the only diploid cell.
The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis, producing four haploid cells, which grow into haploid multicellular organisms.
These organisms produce gametes by mitosis.
The gametes fuse through a process called syngamy to produce diploid zygotes which undergo meiosis, continuing the life cycle.
Diploid Life Cycles
Organisms that have a diploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as diploid adults.
All diploid adults inherit half of their DNA from each parent.
When they are ready to reproduce, diploid reproductive cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid gametes.
These gametes then fuse through fertilization and produce a diploid zygote, which immediately enters G 1 of the cell cycle.
