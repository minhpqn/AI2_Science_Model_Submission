What causes albinism?
This rare albino alligator must have the specific "instructions," or DNA, to have this quality.
The cause of albinism is a mutation in a gene for melanin, a protein found in skin and eyes.
Such a mutation may result in no melanin production at all or a significant decline in the amount of melanin.
A change in the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA is called a mutation .
Does the word mutation make you think of science fiction and bug-eyed monsters?
Think again.
Everyone has mutations.
In fact, most people have dozens or even hundreds of mutations in their DNA.
Mutations are essential for evolution to occur.
They are the ultimate source of all new genetic material - new alleles - in a species.
Although most mutations have no effect on the organisms in which they occur, some mutations are beneficial.
Even harmful mutations rarely cause drastic changes in organisms.
Types of Mutations
There are a variety of types of mutations.
Two major categories of mutations are germline mutations and somatic mutations.
Germline mutations occur in gametes.
These mutations are especially significant because they can be transmitted to offspring and every cell in the offspring will have the mutation.
Somatic mutations occur in other cells of the body.
These mutations may have little effect on the organism because they are confined to just one cell and its daughter cells.
