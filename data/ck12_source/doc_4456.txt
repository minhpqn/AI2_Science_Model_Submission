The Human Biology chapter provides an overview of the physiology of humans, from the skin inward.
In addition to the skin, the skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, immune, and reproductive systems are described.
Organization of the Human Body
Outline the levels of organization of the human body.

How is the human body similar to a well-tuned machine?
Many people have compared the human body to a machine.
Think about some common machines, such as drills and washing machines.
Each machine consists of many parts, and each part does a specific job, yet all the parts work together to perform an overall function.
The human body is like a machine in all these ways.
In fact, it may be the most fantastic machine on Earth.

Levels of Organization
The human machine is organized at different levels, starting with the cell and ending with the entire organism (see Figure below ).
At each higher level of organization, there is a greater degree of complexity.
