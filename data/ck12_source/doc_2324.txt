This type of printer forms an object, layer by layer, by spraying a fine powder of plastic or metal instead of toner.
It sprays the powder in a pattern directed by a computer program.
A laser beam melts the powder, which then hardens.

What Is Technology?
Printers like the one that made the plastic bicycle are a new type of technology.
Technology is the application of science to solve problems.
Because technology finds solutions to practical problems, new technologies may have major impacts on society, science, and industry.
For example, some people predict that 3-D printing will revolutionize manufacturing.
Q:
Making products with 3-D printers has several advantages over making them with machines in factories.
What do you think some of the advantages might be?
A:
Making products with 3-D printers would allow anyone anywhere to make just about anything, provided they have the printer, powder, and computer program.
Suppose, for example, that you live in a remote location and need a new part for your car.
The solution?
Just download the design on your computer and print the part on your 3-D printer.
Manufacturing would no longer require specially designed machines in factories that produce pollution.
Another advantage of using 3-D printers to make products is that no materials are wasted.
