The habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it is adapted.
A habitatâ€™s features are determined mainly by abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall.
These factors also influence the traits of the organisms that live there.
Competitive Exclusion Principle
A given habitat may contain many different species, but each species must have a different niche.
Two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same place for very long.
This is known as the competitive exclusion principle .
If two species were to occupy the same niche, what do you think would happen?
They would compete with one another for the same food and other resources in the environment.
Eventually, one species would be likely to outcompete and replace the other.
Ecology is the study of how living things interact with each other and with their environment.
The environment includes abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) factors.
An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions.
A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem.
