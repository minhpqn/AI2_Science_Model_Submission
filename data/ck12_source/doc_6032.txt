The distance between the particles of a gas is much, much greater than the distances between the particles of a liquid or a solid.
Most of the volume of a gas, therefore, is composed of the empty space between the particles.
In fact, the volume of the particles themselves is considered to be insignificant compared to the volume of the empty space.
Gas particles are in constant rapid motion in random directions .
The fast motion of gas particles gives them a relatively large amount of kinetic energy.
Recall that kinetic energy is the energy that an object possesses because of its motion.
The particles of a gas move in straight-line motion until they collide with another particle or with one of the walls of its container.
Collisions between gas particles and between particles and the container walls are elastic collisions .
An elastic collision is one in which there is no overall loss of kinetic energy.
Kinetic energy may be transferred from one particle to another during an elastic collision, but there is no change in the total energy of the colliding particles.
There are no forces of attraction or repulsion between gas particles .
Attractive forces are responsible for particles of a real gas condensing together to form a liquid.
It is assumed that the particles of an ideal gas have no such attractive forces.
The motion of each particle is completely independent of the motion of all other particles.
The average kinetic energy of gas particles is dependent upon the temperature of the gas.
As the temperature of a sample of gas is increased, the speeds of the particles are increased.
This results in an increase in the kinetic energy of the particles.
Not all particles of gas in a sample have the same speed and so they do not have the same kinetic energy.
The temperature of a gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas particles.
Gas particles travel in random straight-line motion according to the kinetic molecular theory
