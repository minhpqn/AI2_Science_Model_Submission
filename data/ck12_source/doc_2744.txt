Predict the boiling points of iso -pentane and neo -pentane.
A:
The boiling point of iso -pentane is 28 °C, and the boiling point of neo -pentane is 10 °C.
Hydrocarbons with the same numbers of atoms but different shapes form different compounds called isomers.
Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms have isomers.
The more carbon atoms a hydrocarbon has, the greater the number of isomers.
Isomers are different compounds with different properties, such as different boiling and melting points.
