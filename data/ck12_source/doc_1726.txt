Map of temperatures of the Earth
Temperature varies with latitude.
If you look closely you can see that other factors influence temperature.
Mountain ranges, for example, are cooler than they should be for their latitude.

Different latitude leads to different climates for these cities
Map of North America showing the locations of four cities that lie along the same longitude.
Austin, Texas;
Wichita, Kansas;
Fargo, North Dakota; and Thompson, Manitoba in Canada all roughly lie on the 97° west longitude line ( Figure above and Figure above ).
But they run the length of the North America from 30°N in Austin, to 38°N in Wichita, to 47°N in Fargo, and to 56°N in Thompson.
Other factors affect their climate, but all four cities are inland.
