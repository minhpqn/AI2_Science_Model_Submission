The device is propelled by particles flying out of it at high speed in the other direction.
How Rockets Work
Rockets were used for centuries in wars and for fireworks before anyone could explain how they worked.
In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton developed his Laws of Motion.
The third law says:
To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
In other words, when a rocket's propulsion pushes in one direction, the rocket moves in the opposite direction ( Figure below ).
Action and reaction in a rocket
A rocket pushes in one direction so that it moves in the opposite direction.
For a long time, many people believed that a rocket wouldnâ€™t work in space.
There would be nothing for the rocket to push against.
But they do work!
Fuel is ignited in a chamber.
The gases in the chamber explode.
The explosion creates pressure that forces the gases out of one side of the rocket.
The rocket moves in the opposite direction ( Figure below ).
The force pushing the rocket is called thrust .
Space Shuttle Launch
This Space Shuttle launch shows how the thrust of the rocket pushes the shuttle upward into the sky.
