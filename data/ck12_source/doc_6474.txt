Electricity on the other hand, requires the passage of electrons through a conducting medium, such as a wire, in order to do work.
This work could be lighting a light bulb or powering a refrigerator or heating a house.
When the redox reaction is direct, those electrons cannot be made to do work.
Instead, we must separate the oxidation process from the reduction process and force the electrons to move from one place to another in between.
That is the key to the structure of the electrochemical cell.
An electrochemical cell is any device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy or electrical energy into chemical energy.
There are three components that make up an electrochemical reaction.
There must be a solution where redox reactions can occur.
These reactions generally take place in water to facilitate electron and ion movement.
A conductor must exist for electrons to be transferred.
This conductor is usually some kind of wire so that electrons can move from one site to another.
Ions also must be able to move through some form of salt bridge that facilitates ion migration.
Electrochemistry is defined.
A description of an electrochemical cell is given.
