The Cascades ( Figure below ) are a chain of volcanoes at a convergent boundary.
In this region, an oceanic plate is subducting beneath a continental plate.
Map of volcanoes on the Cascade Range
The Cascade Range is formed by volcanoes created from subduction of oceanic crust beneath the North American continent.
The Cascades have been active for 27 million years.
The mountains we see today are no more than 2 million years old.
The volcanoes receive a lot of winter snow, and many are covered by glaciers ( Figure below

The Cascades are shown on this interactive map with photos and descriptions of each of the volcanoes:
Divergent plate boundaries
At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart.
As the hot mantle rock rises, it goes from higher to lower pressure.
This is because there is no longer the weight of all the rock above it.
Lower pressure lowers the melting temperature of the rock (2 in the previous section).
This is why there is volcanism at divergent plate boundaries.
Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures.
Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge.
