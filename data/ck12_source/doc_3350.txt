Earth’s magnetic poles are not the same as the geographic poles.
Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetosphere.
It is strongest at the poles.
At the following URL, use the simulation to explore Earth’s magnetic field.
Then write a paragraph to describe your observations.
How does Earth act as a bar magnet?
The compass in a car shows that the car is moving north.
Does this mean that the car is moving toward 90° north latitude?
Why or why not?
Describe the magnetosphere.
Magnetic Field Reversal
Describe a magnetic field reversal.
Identify evidence for magnetic field reversals.
Do you like science fiction?
This is a fictional scene that is set in the future.
Science fiction artists are so creative!
They might even describe a time when compasses point south instead of north.
Actually, this idea isn’t fiction—it’s a fact.
Earth’s magnetic poles have switched places repeatedly in the past.
As you can see in the Figure below , each time the switch occurred, Earth’s magnetic field was reversed.
