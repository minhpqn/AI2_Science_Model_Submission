Life on Earth
What is Earth's most unique feature?
Mars is a lot like Earth.
Mars is rocky and has an atmosphere.
Mars even has water!
But Mars (and Mercury, Venus, the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) does not have any evidence of life.
Life is what makes Earth unique.
It is also part of Earth's dynamic nature.
Life is part of many Earth processes.
Life is also dynamic in itself.
Constantly adapting and evolving, life forms are always changing.
Except those that are so well adapted to their environment, they haven't changed in hundreds of millions of years.
Describe modern biodiversity and its relationship to evolutionary adaptations.
Do you know life on Earth?
It's likely that there are many places on Earth that you would not recognize as being on your home planet.
There are also many creatures that you would not realize that you share a planet with.
That's because of the incredible diversity of species.
Wouldn't it be fun to see some of these unusual creatures?
More than 1.3 million species of organisms have been cataloged.
Many millions of species have not been discovered yet.
