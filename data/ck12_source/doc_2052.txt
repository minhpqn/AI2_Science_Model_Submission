Modern life is so diverse!
Plants are found in the oceans and all over the land.
Plants can have a single cell.
They can be giant trees.
Animals are also extremely diverse.
They can also be very different in size, from a single cell to the largest animal that ever livedâ€”a blue whale!
Animals and plants live as part of ecosystems.
Ecosystems are different from each other but they have organisms playing nearly all the same roles.
There must be a source of food energy.
For most life on Earth food energy comes directly or indirectly from photosynthesis.
Feeding from plants are herbivores, and from herbivores are carnivores.
There are predators, scavengers, and decomposers, among others, to fill out the ecosystem.
