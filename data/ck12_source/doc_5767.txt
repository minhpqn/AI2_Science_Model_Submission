Explain why noble gases are almost completely nonreactive.
What is the octet rule?
How is it related to noble gases?
Hydrogen (H) atoms have one electron and exist as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules (H 2 ).
Helium atoms have two electrons and exist only as single helium atoms.
Explain why hydrogen and helium differ in this way.
Describe physical and chemical properties of halogens.
List some uses of halogens.
You’ve probably seen halogen lights like the ones pictured here.
You may even have halogen lights in your home.
If you do, you may have noticed that they get really hot and give off a lot of light for their size.
A halogen light differs from a regular incandescent light bulb in having a small amount of halogen gas inside the bulb.
The gas combines chemically with the metal in the filament, and this extends the life of the filament.
It allows the lamp to get hotter and give off more light than a regular incandescent light without burning out quickly.
What is halogen gas, and which elements are halogens?
In this article, you’ll find out.
Meet the Halogens
Halogens are highly reactive nonmetallic elements in group 17 of the periodic table.
As you can see in the periodic table shown in the Figure below , the halogens include the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At).
All of them are relatively common on Earth except for astatine.
