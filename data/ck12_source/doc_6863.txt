Are arthropods just creepy and scary?
Many arthropods, such as scorpions, insects, and spiders, have a reputation of being a nuisance or even harmful.
But even if they are a little scary to you, that doesn't mean that the world would be fine without them.
Importance of Arthropods
Have you ever been startled by a bee landing on a flower?
Or surprised by a swarm of pill bugs when you overturned a rock?
These arthropods might seem a little scary to you, but they are actually performing important roles in the environment.
Arthropods are important to the ecosystem and to humans in many ways.
Arthropods as Food
Many species of crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters ( Figure below ), shrimp, prawns, and crayfish, are consumed by humans, and are now farmed on a large commercial scale.
Nearly 10,000,000 tons of arthropods as food were produced in 2005.
Over 70% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns.
Over 80% is produced in Asia, with China producing nearly half the world’s total.
Insects and their grubs are at least as nutritious as meat, and are eaten both raw and cooked in many cultures.
Beetles, locusts, butterflies, ants, and stinkbugs (which have an apple flavor) are insects that are regularly eaten by people in dozens of countries.
In fact, there are more than 1,900 edible insect species on Earth, hundreds of which are already part of the diet of about two billion people worldwide.
This is just under one of every three people worldwide, and this number should continue to grow in the future.
The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept.
However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination.
Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields.
