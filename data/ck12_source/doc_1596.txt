In the same way, your body makes new cells by dividing the cells you already have.
In all cases, cells only come from cells that have existed before.
This idea led to the development of one of the most important theories in biology, the cell theory .
Cell theory states that:
All organisms are composed of cells.
Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in all organisms.
All cells come from other cells.
As with other scientific theories, many hundreds, if not thousands, of experiments support the cell theory.
Since Virchow created the theory, no evidence has ever been identified to contradict it.
Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also can be very different ( Figure below ).
Each cell in your body is designed for a specific task.
In other words, the cell's function is partly based on the cell's structure.
For example:
Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and brings it to other body cells.
Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of communication with other nerve cells, like a wire.
Because of this shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of touching a hot stove, to your brain.
Skin cells are flat and fit tightly together to protect your body.
As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs.
Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have many types of specialized cells in their bodies.
