How would you classify viruses?
The study of viruses is known as virology and people who study viruses are known as virologists .
Viruses infect and live inside the cells of living organisms.
When viruses infect the cells of their host, they may cause disease.
For example, viruses cause AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome), influenza (flu), chicken pox, and the common cold.
Therapy is sometimes difficult for viral diseases.
Antibiotics have no effect on viruses and only a few antiviral drugs are available for some diseases.
One of the best ways to prevent viral diseases is with a vaccine , which produces immunity .
But vaccines are available for only a few diseases.
Mimivirus, shown in the Figure below , is the largest known virus, with a diameter of 400 nm.
Protein filaments measuring 100 nm stick out from the surface of the virus, which increases the diameter of the virus to about 600 nm.
This is bigger than a small bacterial cell.
The virus appears hexagonal under an electron microscope; the viral shape is icosahedral (having 20 faces or sides).

The largest known virus, called mimivirus, is so large that scientists first mistook it for a bacterium.
It was first discovered in amoeba, in 1992, and was identified as a virus in 2003.
Scientists believe that mimivirus may cause certain types of pneumonia in humans.
The core contains DNA, with the majority of the DNA in genes, and only 10% DNA of unknown function ("junk" DNA).
Viruses can replicate only by infecting a host cell.
They cannot reproduce on their own.
