What are single nucleotide polymorephisms?
What is ENCODE?
Biotechnology and Medicine - Advanced
Describe various applications of biotechnology as related to medicine.
How is DNA technology related to genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis?
Is this possible?
Of course DNA is much smaller than shown here and you cannot see it in a test tube.
But you can manipulate and study DNA.
Biotechnology and its associated techniques have made DNA-based biomedical research and analysis fairly routine.
Applications of DNA Technology:
Medicine
Biotechnology and DNA technology could be considered synonymous.
So much of biotechnology is DNA based.
Remember that biotechnology is technology based on biological applications.
Since the completion of the human genome project, the data produced from the project and the tools and technologies associated with the project have led to numerous biotechnology applications.
As discussed in the DNA Technology:
The Human Genome Project (Advanced) concept, the Human Genome Project has opened up many avenues to take advantage of what we know about our genome in order to help us.
Many of these possibilities are medically related.
Others will be legally related.
And yet still other uses of DNA technology include those involving other genomes, especially in agriculture and the food sciences.
