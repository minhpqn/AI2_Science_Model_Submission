Coefficients are used to balance chemical equations.
A coefficient is a number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula.
It shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction.
To balance a chemical equation, place coefficients as needed in front of the symbols or formulas so the same number of each type of atom occurs in both reactants and products.

Which of the following chemical equations is balanced?
Zn + HCl → ZnCl 2 + H 2
2 Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl 2 + H 2
2 Zn + HCl → ZnCl 2 + H 2
Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl 2 + H 2
Balance this chemical equation:
CH 4 + O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 O
