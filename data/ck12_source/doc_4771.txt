The scientific method is the process by which biological information, like that of all other sciences, has been identified.
This method has produced scientific theories and laws, including the cell theory and the theory of evolution.
All life, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whale, and all other prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants and animals in between, have characteristics of life in common.
All life responds to their environment, grows and changes, reproduces and has offspring, has a complex chemistry, maintains homeostasis, is built of structures called cells and passes their traits onto their offspring.
