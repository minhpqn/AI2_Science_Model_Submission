The scientific method is a series of steps.
These steps help scientists (or even just people!) investigate a question.
Often, students learn that the scientific method goes from step to step to step in a specific order, like so:
Ask a question.
The question can be based on one or more observations or on data from a previous experiment.
Do some background research.
Create a hypothesis.
Use your imagination and reasoning skills.
Conduct experiments or make observations to test the hypothesis.
Gather the data.
Use logical reasoning to formulate a conclusion.
In reality, however, the process doesn’t always go in a straight line.
A scientist might ask a question and then start doing some background research.
During his research, he may discover that his original question needed to be asked in a different way, or that an entirely different question should be asked.
As a result, he is brought back to the first step of the scientific method.

Ask a Question
Now, let’s ask a scientific question.
Remember that it must be testable.
We learned in the previous concept, "Scientific Explanations and Interpretations," that the average global temperature has been on the rise.
