All alkali metals react readily with water to produce the metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
The resulting solutions are basic.
2\text{K}(s) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{KOH}(aq) + \text{H}_2(g)
Bases that consist of an alkali metal cation and the hydroxide anion are all very soluble in water.
Compounds of the Group 2 metals (the alkaline earth metals) are also basic.
However, these compounds are generally not as soluble in water.
Therefore the dissociation reactions for these compounds are shown as equilibrium reactions.
\text{Mg(OH)}_2(s) \overset{\text{H}_2\text{O}}{\rightleftharpoons} \text{Mg}^{2+}(aq)+2\text{OH}^-(aq)
These relatively insoluble hydroxides were some of the compounds discussed in the context of the solubility product constant (K_{sp}) .
The solubility of magnesium hydroxide is 0.0084 g per liter of water at 25Â°C.
Because of its low solubility, magnesium hydroxide is not as dangerous as sodium hydroxide.
In fact, magnesium hydroxide is the active ingredient in a product called milk of magnesia, which is used as an antacid or a mild laxative.
