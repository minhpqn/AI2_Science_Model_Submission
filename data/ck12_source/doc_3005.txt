Starting and Stopping
Did you ever ride a skateboard?
Even if you didn’t, you probably know that to start a skateboard rolling over a level surface, you need to push off with one foot against the ground.
That’s what Corey’s friend Nina is doing in this picture below .

Do you know how to stop a skateboard once it starts rolling?
Look how Nina's friend Laura does it in the Figure above .
She steps down on the back of the skateboard so it scrapes on the pavement.
This creates friction, which stops the skateboard.
Even if Laura didn’t try to stop the skateboard, it would stop sooner or later.
That’s because there’s also friction between the wheels and the pavement.
Friction is a force that counters all kinds of motion.
It occurs whenever two surfaces come into contact.
Laura learned how to use forces to start and stop her skateboard by watching the videos below.
Watch the video to see how the forces are applied.
