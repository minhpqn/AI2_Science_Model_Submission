The electrochemical potential across a membrane determines the tendency of an ion to cross the membrane.
The membrane may be that of a cell or organelle or other sub cellular compartment.
The electrochemical potential arises from three factors:
the difference in the concentration of the ions on either side of the membrane,
the charge of the ions (for example Na + , Ca ++ , Cl - ), and
the difference in voltage between the two sides of the membrane (the transmembrane potential).
Cotransport of ions by symporters and antiporter carriers is commonly used to actively move ions across biological membranes.
Transmembrane ATPases are often involved in maintaining ion gradients.
The Na+/K+ ATPase uses ATP to build and maintain a sodium ion gradient and a potassium ion gradient.
Proton Gradients and ATP synthase
One particular ion gradient with biological significance is the proton (H + ) gradient.
This type of gradient is established through active transport involving proton pumps.
The proton gradient is used during photosynthesis and cellular respiration to generate a chemiosmotic potential, or proton motive force.
This potential energy is used for the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.
The proton gradient can also be used to store energy for heat production and flagellar rotation.
The energy held within the proton gradient can be used to synthesize ATP.
ATP synthase is a transmembrane enzyme that provides energy for the cell to use by producing ATP.
The protein has two distinct regions, F 0 and F 1 .
The F 0 domain is embedded within the membrane, while the F 1 domain is above the membrane, inside the matrix of the mitochondria, or the stroma of the chloroplast.
The F 0 region is the proton pore, allowing hydrogen ions to diffuse across the membrane.
