How does the ammonium ion serve as an acid on the right-hand side of the equation?
Write the conjugate acid-base pairs for the reaction between two water molecules illustrated above.
amphoteric substance:
One that is capable of acting as either an acid or a base by donating or accepting hydrogen ions.
conjugate acid:
The particle produced when a base accepts a proton.
conjugate acid-base pair:
A pair of substances related by the loss or gain of a single hydrogen ion.
conjugate base:
The particle produced when an acid donates a proton.

The big picture gets bigger
Ideas in science never stay static.
One discovery builds on another.
Our concepts of acids and bases have grown from the fundamental ideas of Arrhenius to Brønsted-Lowry to Lewis.
Each step adds to our understanding of the world around us and makes the “big picture” even bigger.
