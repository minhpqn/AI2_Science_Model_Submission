U_{sp} = \frac{1}{2} kx^2  ; the potential energy of a spring is equal to one half times the spring constant times the distance squared that it is stretched or compressed from equilibrium
The oscillating object does not lose any energy in SHM.
Friction is assumed to be zero.
In harmonic motion there is always a restorative force, which attempts to restore the oscillating object to its equilibrium position.
The restorative force changes during an oscillation and depends on the position of the object.
In a spring the force is given by Hooke’s Law:
F = -kx
The period, T , is the amount of time needed for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle.
In SHM, T is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction.
The frequency, f, is the number of cycles an object goes through in 1 second.
Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) . 1\ Hz = 1 cycle per sec.
The amplitude, A , is the distance from the equilibrium (or center) point of motion to either its lowest or highest point ( end points ).
The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object.
The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion, but is constant in SHM.

Mass & Springs (PhET Simulation)
A rope can be considered as a spring with a very high spring constant k, so high, in fact, that you don’t notice the rope stretch at all before it “pulls back.”
What is the k of a rope that stretches by 1\;\mathrm{mm} when a 100\;\mathrm{kg} weight hangs from it?
