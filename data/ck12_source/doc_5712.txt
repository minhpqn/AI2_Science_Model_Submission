There are four quantum numbers that provide information about various aspects of electron behavior.
Watch the video, pause at each question and try to calculate the quantum number before you see the answer written in.
Do not try to answer the orbital questions, just the quantum number ones.

What is the principal quantum number?
What does the spin quantum number represent?
angular momentum quantum number (l) :
Describes the general region occupied by the electron.
magnetic quantum number (m) :
Describes the orbital orientation of the electron in space.
principal quantum number (n) :
Specifies the main energy level occupied by the electron.
quantum numbers:
Describe the location of an electron in an atom.
spin quantum number (m_s) :
Describes the spin for a given electron.
