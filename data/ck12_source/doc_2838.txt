Gamma rays can be stopped only by several centimeters of lead or several meters of concrete.
It’s no surprise that they can penetrate and damage cells deep inside the body.
You can learn more about the effects of gamma radiation on people at this URL:
Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves that carry photons of energy called gamma particles.
They are the most energetic of all electromagnetic waves.
Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay of an excited nucleus.
During gamma decay, the nucleus emits a “packet” of energy called a gamma particle.
Gamma rays are more dangerous than the particles of matter emitted during alpha or beta decay.
Review gamma decay by reading the article at the following URL.
As you read, make a list of main ideas in the article.
What are gamma rays?
What happens during gamma decay?
Explain why gamma decay occurs.
Define the half-life of a radioisotope.
Explain variation in half-lives.
Assume that you cut a sheet of paper down the center to get two halves.
Then you cut each half down the center to get four pieces.
If you keep cutting the pieces of paper in half, you would soon a reach a point where the pieces are too small to cut again.
A radioactive isotope is a little like that sheet of paper.
What Is a Radioactive Isotope?
