What other organs do insects like this horsefly have?
Besides sensing their environment, what other functions do their organs serve?
Most members of the subphylum Hexapoda are insects (class Insecta).
In fact, more than half of all known organisms are insects.

Structure and Function of Insects
Insects range in length from less than a millimeter to about the length of your arm.
They can be found in most habitats, but they are mainly terrestrial.
Many can fly, so they are also aerial.
Like other arthropods, insects have a head, thorax, and abdomen.
They have a wide variety of appendages, including six legs attached to the thorax.
Insects have a pair of antennae for “smelling” and “tasting” chemicals.
