The excess reactant (or excess reagent) is the reactant that is initially present in a greater amount than will eventually be reacted.
In other words, there is always excess reactant left over after the reaction is complete.
In the above example, the N 2 is the excess reactant.
The amount of limiting reactant determines how much product will be formed in a chemical reaction.
Watch the video at the link below and answer the following questions:
What reaction is occurring?
How is the reaction measured?
What do the balloons tell us?
In the Haber reaction illustrated above, how do we know that hydrogen is the limiting reactant?
What if hydrogen were left over?
Which material would be limiting if no hydrogen or nitrogen were left over?
excess reactant (or excess reagent):
The reactant that is initially present in a greater amount than will eventually be reacted.
limiting reactant (or limiting reagent):
The reactant that determines the amount of product that can be formed in a chemical reaction.
Determining the Limiting Reactant
Perform calculations to determine the limiting reactant in a chemical reaction.
Brownies can be a limiting reagent
