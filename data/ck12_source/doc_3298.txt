Describe how the transfer of electrons changes the charge of matter.
Relate the transfer of electrons to the law of conservation of charge.
Compare and contrast three ways that electric charge can be transferred.
Why is this girl's hair standing straight up?
She is touching a device called a van de Graaff generator.
The dome on top of the device has a negative electric charge.
When the girl places her hand on the dome, she becomes negatively charged as wellâ€”right down to the tip of each hair!
You can see a video demonstrating a van de Graff generator at this URL:

Q:
What causes the hair to stand on end?
A:
All of the hairs have all become negatively charged, and like charges repel each other.
Therefore, the hairs are pushing away from each other, causing them to stand on end.
The girl pictured above became negatively charged because electrons flowed from the van de Graaff generator to her.
Whenever electrons are transferred between objects, neutral matter becomes charged.
This occurs even with individual atoms.
Atoms are neutral in electric charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons.
However, if atoms lose or gain electrons, they become charged particles called ions.
You can see how this happens in the Figure below .
