The drop or flake falls when it becomes too heavy for updrafts to keep it aloft.
As a drop or flake falls, it may collect more water and get larger.
Types of Precipitation
Why does it snow instead of rain?
Air temperature determines which type of precipitation falls.
Rain falls if the air temperature is above freezing (0° C or 32° F).
Frozen precipitation falls if the air or ground is below freezing.
Frozen precipitation may fall as snow , sleet , or freezing rain .
Below, you can see how the different types form ( Figure below ).
Diagram of snow, sleet, and freezing rain
Frozen precipitation may fall as snow, sleet, or freezing rain.
Precipitation falls when it gets too heavy to stay in a cloud.
Rain droplets caught up in air currents within a cloud get larger by the addition of condensed droplets until they are too heavy and they fall.
If the ground is very cold, rain can freeze to become sleet or glaze.
