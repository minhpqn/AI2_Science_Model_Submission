Protons with momentum 5.1 \times 10^{-20} \;\mathrm{kg} \cdot \;\mathrm{m/s} are magnetically steered clockwise in a circular path.
The path is 2.0 \;\mathrm{km} in diameter. (This takes place at the Dann International Accelerator Laboratory, to be built in 2057 in San Francisco.) Find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field acting on the protons.
An electron is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 1.67 \times 10^5 volts.
It then enters a region traveling perpendicular to a magnetic field of 0.25 \;\mathrm{T} .
Calculate the velocity of the electron.
Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic force on the electron.
Calculate the radius of the circle of the electronâ€™s path in the region of the magnetic field
A beam of charged particles travel in a straight line through mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields.
One of the particles has a charge, q ; the magnetic field is B and the electric field is E .
Find the velocity of the particle.
A positron (same mass, opposite charge as an electron) is accelerated through 35,000 volts and enters the center of a 1.00 \;\mathrm{cm} long and 1.00 \;\mathrm{mm} wide capacitor, which is charged to 400 volts.
A magnetic filed is applied to keep the positron in a straight line in the capacitor.
The same field is applied to the region (region II) the positron enters after the capacitor.
What is the speed of the positron as it enters the capacitor?
Show all forces on the positron.
