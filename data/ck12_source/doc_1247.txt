Describe how magnetite indicates magnetic pole.
Why does it sometimes point to a spot that is not where the pole is located?
How did scientists use magnetic evidence to conclude that the continents moved?
Bathymetric Evidence for Seafloor Spreading
Describe how echosounders can be used to create bathymetric maps.
Identify features of the seafloor.
How can war further science?
Oddly, the thing that was needed to further Wegener's continental drift idea was World War II.
U.S.
Navy ships cruised the seas.
They carried instruments that helped scientists to locate the mechanism for moving continents.
During World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders.
Their goal was to locate enemy submarines ( Figure below ).
Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions.
The sound waves bounce off the nearest object and then return to the ship.
Scientists know the speed of sound in seawater.
They then can calculate the distance to the object that the sound wave hit.
Most of these sound waves did not hit submarines.
They instead were used to map the ocean floor.
