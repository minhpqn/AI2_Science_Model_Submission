A = B = C \ldots theyâ€™re all at the same electric potential
Below are the electric potential lines for a certain arrangement of charges.
Draw the direction of the electric field for all the black dots.
A metal sphere with a net charge of +5\ \mu \mathrm{C} and a mass of 400 \;\mathrm{g} is placed at the origin and held fixed there.
Find the electric potential at the coordinate (6 \;\mathrm{m}, 0) .
If another metal sphere of -3 \ \mu \mathrm{C} charge and mass of 20 \;\mathrm{g} is placed at the coordinate (6 \;\mathrm{m}, 0) and left free to move, what will its speed be just before it collides with the metal sphere at the origin?
Collisions of electrons with the surface of your television set give rise to the images you see.
How are the electrons accelerated to high speed?
Consider the following: two metal plates (The right hand one has small holes allow electrons to pass through to the surface of the screen.), separated by 30 \;\mathrm{cm} , have a uniform electric field between them of 400 \;\mathrm{N/C} .
Find the force on an electron located at a point midway between the plates
Find the voltage difference between the two plates
Find the change in electric potential energy of the electron when it travels from the back plate to the front plate
Find the speed of the electron just before striking the front plate (the screen of your TV)
a. 7500\mathrm{V} b. 1.5 \;\mathrm{m/s}
a. 6.4 \times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{N} b. 1300\mathrm{V} c. 2.1 \times 10 ^{-16} \;\mathrm{J} d. 2.2 \times 10^7 \;\mathrm{m/s}
Describe what an electric field is and draw electric field lines.
Calculate electric fields, find the direction a charge would move upon entering an electric field, and determine the force on that charge.
Students will learn what an electric field is, how to draw electric field lines and how to calculate electric fields.
They will also learn to apply the electric field in order to find the direction a charge would move upon entering the field and the force on it.
