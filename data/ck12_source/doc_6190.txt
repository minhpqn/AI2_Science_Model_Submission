By knowing how cold it will get and how much water is in the radiator, we can determine how much antifreeze to add to achieve our desired freezing point depression.
We can do this because we know what the antifreeze is.
Can we switch things around and get some information about the properties of the antifreeze (such as its molecular weight) from the freezing point decrease?
It turns out that we can do this fairly easily and accurately.
Changes in melting point and boiling point can be used to determine molecular weight
Changes in temperature.
Calculating Molar Mass
In the laboratory, freezing point or boiling point data can be used to determine the molar mass of an unknown solute.
Since we know the relationship between a decrease in freezing point and the concentration of solute, if we dissolve a known mass of our unknown solute into a known amount of solvent, we can calculate the molar mass of the solute.
The  K_f or  K_b of the solvent must be known.
We also need to know if the solute is an electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte.
If the solvent is an electrolyte, you would need to know the number of ions is produced when it dissociates.
Sample Problem:
Molar Mass from Freezing Point Depression
38.7 g of a nonelectrolyte is dissolved into 218 g of water.
The freezing point of the solution is measured to be -5.53Â°C.
Calculate the molar mass of the solute.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
\Delta T_f=-5.53^\circ \ \text{C}
