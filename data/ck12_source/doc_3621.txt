In prophase of mitosis and meiosis II, homologous chromosomes do not form pairs in this way.
Crossing-over occurs during this phase (see the Genetic Variation concept).
Metaphase I:
Spindle fibers attach to the paired homologous chromosomes.
The paired chromosomes line up along the equator (middle) of the cell.
This occurs only in metaphase I.
In metaphase of mitosis and meiosis II, it is sister chromatids that line up along the equator of the cell.
Anaphase I:
Spindle fibers shorten, and the chromosomes of each homologous pair start to separate from each other.
One chromosome of each pair moves toward one pole of the cell, and the other chromosome moves toward the opposite pole.
Telophase I and Cytokinesis:
The spindle breaks down, and new nuclear membranes form.
The cytoplasm of the cell divides, and two haploid daughter cells result.
The daughter cells each have a random assortment of chromosomes, with one from each homologous pair.
Both daughter cells go on to meiosis II.
The DNA does not replicate between meiosis I and meiosis II.
Prophase II:
The nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle begins to form in each haploid daughter cell from meiosis I.
The centrioles also start to separate.
Metaphase II:
