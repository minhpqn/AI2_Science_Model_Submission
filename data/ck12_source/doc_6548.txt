Unlike cyclohexane, benzene only contains six hydrogen atoms, giving the impression that the ring is unsaturated and each carbon atom participates in one double bond.
Two different structures with alternating single and double bonds around the ring can be written for benzene.
Benzene can be written as the resonance hybrid of two structures with alternating double and single bonds
In benzene, the true bonding between carbon atoms is neither a single nor a double bond.
Rather, all of the bonds are a hybrid of a single and double bond.
In benzene, the pi bonding electrons are free to move completely around the ring.
Delocalized electrons are electrons that are not confined to the bond between two atoms, but are instead allowed to move between three or more.
The delocalization of the electrons in benzene can best be shown by showing benzene with a ring inside the hexagon, with the hydrogen atoms understood.
Benzene is often drawn as a circle in a hexagon
Delocalization of the electrons makes for a more stable molecule than a similar molecule that does not have delocalized electrons.
Benzene is a more stable and less reactive compound than straight-chain hexenes.
The sp 2 hybridization of the carbon atoms results in a planar molecule as opposed to the puckered structure of cyclohexane.
Benzene rings are common in a great number of natural substances and biomolecules.
The figure below shows the structural formulas for vanilla and naphthalene.
Naphthalens is a chemical which is commonly used in mothballs.
Structures of common aromatic compounds
Nomenclature of Aromatic Compounds
The simplest aromatic compounds are benzene rings with one substituent replacing one of the hydrogen atoms.
If this substituent is an alkyl group, it is named first, followed in one word with “benzene”.
The molecule shown below is therefore called ethylbenzene.
