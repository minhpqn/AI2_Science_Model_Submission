This gives carbon-12 nuclei a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons, so carbon-12 nuclei are stable.
Some carbon atoms have more than 6 neutrons, either 7 or 8.
Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons are called carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons).
The nuclei of carbon-14 atoms are unstable because they have too many neutrons relative to protons, so they gradually decay.
Q:
What is the proton-to-neutron ratio of carbon-14 nuclei?
A:
With six protons and 8 neutrons, the ratio is 6:8, or 1:1.3.
Q:
How is carbon-14 used to estimate the ages of fossils?
A:
Living things take in carbon, including tiny amounts of carbon-14, throughout life.
The carbon-14 constantly decays, but more carbon-14 is taken in all the time to replace it.
After living things die, no new carbon-14 is taken in, and the carbon-14 they already have keeps decaying.
The older a fossil is, the less carbon-14 it still has, so the remaining amount can be measured to estimate the fossilâ€™s age.
