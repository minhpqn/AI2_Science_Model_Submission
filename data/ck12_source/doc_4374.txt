Amphibians as Prey and Predators
Amphibians are an important food source for animals such as birds, snakes, raccoons, and fish.
Amphibians are also important predators.
As larvae, they feed mainly on small aquatic animals such as water insects.
They may also feed on algae.
As adults, amphibians are completely carnivorous .
They may catch and eat worms, snails, and insects, as the frog in Figure below is doing.
Unlike other amphibians, caecilians are burrowers .
They use their head to dig in the soil, and they feed on earthworms and other annelids.
Caecilians can be found in moist soil near rivers and streams in tropical regions.

The Threat of Amphibian Extinction
Currently, almost one third of all amphibian species face the threat of extinction.
The reasons include habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of non-native species.
Most of these problems are the result of human actions.
Amphibians have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the environment.
This may explain why they seem to be especially sensitive to pollution.
Monitoring the health and survival of amphibians may help people detect pollution early, before other organisms are affected.
