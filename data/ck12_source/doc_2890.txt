What is the molecule that delivers the amino acids?
What ends protein synthesis?
What is a gene?
What is an amino acid?
If every human cell has the same genes, how can they look and function so differently?
What is the relationship between DNA and proteins?
Distinguish between DNA and RNA.
Name the three types of RNA.
Explain the functions of each type of RNA.
How does your DNA send a message?
DNA is the blueprint that provides the directions on how to build all the proteins your body needs to function.
However, DNA is confined to the nucleus and, therefore, isn't involved directly in the process of actually making the proteins.
So how does DNA tell the rest of the cell what to do?
It sends a message!
The messengers consist of a special type of RNA.
DNA contains the instructions to create proteins, but it does not make proteins itself.
DNA is located in the nucleus, which it never leaves, while proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
So DNA needs a messenger to bring its instructions to a ribosome located outside of the nucleus.
DNA sends out a message, in the form of RNA (ribonucleic acid), describing how to make the protein.
There are three types of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis:
