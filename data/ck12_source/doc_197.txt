v_{\text{ave}} = \frac{1}{2} (v_f + v_i)
The distance, then, for uniformly accelerating motion can be found by multiplying the average velocity by the time.
d = \frac{1}{2}(v_f + v_i)(t) \qquad (\text{Equation} \ 1)
We know that the final velocity for constantly accelerated motion can be found by multiplying the acceleration times time and adding the result to the initial velocity, v_f = v_i + at .
The second equation that relates displacement, time, initial velocity, and final velocity is generated by substituting this equation into equation 1.
Start by distributing the 1/2 in equation 1 through:
d &= \frac{1}{2} (v_f + v_i)(t) = \frac{1}{2} v_ft + \frac{1}{2} v_it \\
We know that v_f = v_i + at .
Therefore:
\frac{1}{2} v_it + \frac{1}{2}(t)(v_i + at)
= \frac{1}{2} v_it + \frac{1}{2} v_it + \frac{1}{2} at^2\\
= v_it + \frac{1}{2} at^2 \qquad (\text{Equation} \ 2)
The third equation is formed by combining  v_f = v_i + at and d = \frac{1}{2} (v_f + v_i)(t) .  If we solve the first equation for t and then substitute into the second equation, we get
d=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (v_f+v_i) \left(\frac{v_f-v_i}{a}\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(\frac{v^2_f-v^2_i}{a}\right)
And solving for  v{_f}^2 yields
v{_f}^2 = v{_i}^2 + 2ad \qquad (\text{Equation} \ 3)
Keep in mind that these three equations are only valid when acceleration is constant.
In many cases, the initial velocity can be set to zero and that simplifies the three equations considerably.
When acceleration is constant and the initial velocity is zero, the equations can be simplified to:
d &= \frac{1}{2} \ v_f \ t\\d &= \frac{1}{2} \ at^2 \ \text{and}\\v{_f}^2 &= 2ad.
