Ways to control insect pests are described below.
Biological control of pests in farming is a method of controlling pests by using other insects (or other natural predators of the pests).
Biological control of insects relies on predation and parasitism.
Insect predators, such as ladybugs and lacewings, consume a large number of other insects during their lifetime.
If you add ladybugs to your farm or garden, they will help keep insect pests, such as aphids, under control.
Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions, so any control of these pests is beneficial.
Ladybugs also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars.
The larvae of many hoverfly species also feed upon aphids, with one larva consuming up to fifty aphids a day, which is about 1,000 in its lifetime.
They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars.
Dragonflies are important predators of mosquitoes, and can be used to control this pest.
Parasitic insects include insects such as wasps and flies that lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae.
The host is ultimately killed.
Caterpillars also tend to be one likely target of parasitic wasps.
Chemical control of pests involves the use of insecticides.
Insecticides , which are also known as pesticides, are most often used to kill insects.
Insecticides are chemicals that kill insects.
The U.S. spends $9 billion each year on pesticides.
Disadvantages to using pesticides include human, fish, and honeybee poisonings, and the contamination of meat and dairy products.
When choosing to use an insecticide, there are numerous points to consider.
Negative effects of the pesticide should try to be minimized.
