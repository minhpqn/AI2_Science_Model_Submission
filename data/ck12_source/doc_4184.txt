How does water get up?
How does sugar move down?
What structures hold the plant upright?
Are tree trunks also stems?
Of course they are.
Trees don't start out big and tall - they grow from small plants to large trees.
And it is these stems that allow them to grow upright.
So, obviously the stem is very important and has numerous functions.
In vascular plants, stems are the organs that hold plants upright so they can get the sunlight and air they need.
Stems also bear leaves, flowers, cones, and secondary stems.
These structures grow at points called nodes (shown in Figure below ).
At each node, there is a bud of meristem tissue that can divide and specialize to form a particular structure.
Parts of a vascular stem
The stem of a vascular plant has nodes where leaves and other structures may grow.
Another vital function of stems is transporting water and minerals from roots to leaves and carrying food from leaves to the rest of the plant.
Without this connection between roots and leaves, plants could not survive high above ground in the air.
In many plants, stems also store food or water during cold or dry seasons.
Stems show variation because many stems are specialized.
Figure below shows examples of stem specialization.
With specialized stems, plants can exploit a diversity of niches in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems.
