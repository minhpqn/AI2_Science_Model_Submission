There is a 50% chance that a child will inherit the mutated gene.
Huntingtons disease, Achondroplasia, Neurofibromatosis 1, Marfan Syndrome, Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer
Both copies of the gene must be mutated for a person to be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder .
An affected person usually has unaffected parents who each carry a single copy of the mutated gene (and are referred to as carriers).
Cystic fibrosis, Sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, Spinal muscular atrophy
X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome.
Only a few disorders have this inheritance pattern.
X-linked recessive disorders are also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome.
Males are more frequently affected than females.
The sons of a man with an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene.
A woman who carries an X-linked recessive disorder has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene.
Hemophilia A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Color blindness
Y-linked disorders are caused by mutations on the Y chromosome.
Only males can get them, and all of the sons of an affected father are affected.
Y-linked disorders only cause infertility, and may be circumvented with the help of some fertility treatments.
