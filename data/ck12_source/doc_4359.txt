They also have a relatively large brain.
They can solve problems and interact with other members of their species.
They are generally predators with keen senses.
Cartilaginous fish lack a swim bladder.
Instead, they stay afloat by using a pair of muscular fins to push down against the water and create lift.
Cartilaginous Fish.
All of these fish belong to the class of cartilaginous fish with jaws. (a) Oceanic whitetip shark (b) Ray (c) Ratfish
One of the most important traits of cartilaginous fish is their jaws.
Jaws allow them to bite food and break it into smaller pieces.
This is a big adaptive advantage because it greatly expands the range of food sources they can consume.
Jaws also make cartilaginous fish excellent predators.
It youâ€™ve ever seen the film Jaws, then you know that jaws make sharks very fierce predators (see also Figure below ).

Jaws of a Shark.
Sharks have powerful jaws with multiple rows of sharp, saw-like teeth.
Most other fish are no match for these powerful predators.
Ray-finned fish include the majority of living fish species, including goldfish, tuna, salmon, perch, and cod.
They have a bony endoskeleton and a swim bladder.
Their thin fins consist of webs of skin over flexible bony rays, or spines.
The fins lack muscle, so their movements are controlled by muscles in the body wall.
