It shows that when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor.
The gases float off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes.
Suppose you had measured the mass of the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned.
Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the fire and the gases produced by the fire.
What would you find?
The total mass of matter after the fire would be the same as the total mass of matter before the fire.
Burning is a chemical process
Burning is a chemical process.
Q:
What can you infer from this example?
A:
You can infer that burning does not destroy matter.
It just changes matter into different substances.
Law of Conservation of Mass
This burning campfire example illustrates a very important law in science: the law of conservation of mass .
This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed.
Even when matter goes through a physical or chemical change, the total mass of matter always remains the same.
Q:
How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when matter changes state?
A:
