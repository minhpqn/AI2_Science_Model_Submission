Lipids also have several other roles in the body.
For example, lipids protect nerves and make up the membranes that surround cells.
Fats are one type of lipid.
Stored fat gives your body energy to use for later.
It’s like having money in a savings account: it’s there in case you need it.
Stored fat also cushions and protects internal organs.
In addition, it insulates the body.
It helps keep you warm in cold weather.
There are two main types of fats, saturated and unsaturated.
Saturated fats can be unhealthy, even in very small amounts.
They are found mainly in animal foods, such as meats, whole milk, and eggs.
So even though these foods are good sources of proteins, they should be eaten in limited amounts.
Saturated lipids increase cholesterol levels in the blood.
Too much cholesterol in the blood can lead to heart disease.
Unsaturated fats are found mainly in plant foods, such as vegetable oil, olive oil, and nuts.
Unsaturated lipids are also found in fish, such as salmon.
Unsaturated lipids are needed in small amounts for good health.
Most lipids in your diet should be unsaturated.
Another type of lipid is called trans fat .
Trans fats are manufactured and added to certain foods to keep them fresher for longer.
