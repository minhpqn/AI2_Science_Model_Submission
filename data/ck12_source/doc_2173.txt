The four planets closest to the Sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are the inner planets or terrestrial planets ( Figure below ).
They are similar to Earth.
All are solid, dense, and rocky.
None of the inner planets has rings.
Compared to the outer planets, the inner planets are small.
They have shorter orbits around the Sun and they spin more slowly.
Venus spins backward and spins the slowest of all the planets.
All of the inner planets were geologically active at one time.
They are all made of cooled igneous rock with inner iron cores.
Earth has one big, round moon, while Mars has two very small, irregular moons.
Mercury and Venus do not have moons.
The relative sizes of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
This composite shows the relative sizes of the four inner planets.
From left to right, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
The Outer Planets
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the outer planets of our solar system.
These are the four planets farthest from the Sun.
The outer planets are much larger than the inner planets.
Since they are mostly made of gases, they are also called gas giants .
Pictured below are the relative sizes of the outer planets and the Sun ( Figure below
