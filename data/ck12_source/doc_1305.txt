This creates mountains.
Folding and faulting in these collision zones makes the crust thicker.
The worldâ€™s highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing as India collides with Eurasia.
About 80 million years ago, India was separated from Eurasia by an ocean ( Figure below ).
As the plates collided, pieces of the old seafloor were forced over the Asian continent.
This old seafloor is now found high in the Himalayas ( Figure below ).
The Himalaya Mountains rise as India rams into Eurasia
As India rams into Eurasia, the Himalaya Mountains rise.

Oceanic Plate Subduction
Volcanic mountain ranges form when oceanic crust subducts into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries.
The Andes Mountains are a chain of coastal volcanic mountains.
They are forming as the Nazca plate subducts beneath the South American plate ( Figure below ).
The Andes Mountains formed due to oceanic plate subduction
Cotopaxi is in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador.
The 19,300 foot tall mountain is the highest active volcano in the world.
Mid-ocean ridges form at divergent plate boundaries.
As the ocean floor separates an enormous line of volcanoes is created.
Continents can also rift apart; a process called continental rifting .
When continental crust is pulled apart, it breaks into blocks.
