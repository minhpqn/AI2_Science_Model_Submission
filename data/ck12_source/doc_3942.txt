Evidence shows that a sixth mass extinction is occurring now.
Unlike previous mass extinctions, the sixth extinction is due to human actions.
Some scientists consider the sixth extinction to have begun with early hominids during the Pleistocene.
They are blamed for over-killing big mammals such as mammoths.
Since then, human actions have had an ever greater impact on other species.
The present rate of extinction is between 100 and 100,000 species per year.
In 100 years, we could lose more than half of Earth’s remaining species.
Causes of Extinction
The single biggest cause of extinction today is habitat loss .
Agriculture, forestry, mining, and urbanization have disturbed or destroyed more than half of Earth’s land area.
In the U.S., for example, more than 99 percent of tall-grass prairies have been lost.
Other causes of extinction today include:
Exotic species introduced by humans into new habitats.
They may carry disease, prey on native species, and disrupt food webs.
Often, they can out-compete native species because they lack local predators.
An example is described in Figure below .
Over-harvesting of fish, trees, and other organisms.
This threatens their survival and the survival of species that depend on them.
Global climate change, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels.
This is raising Earth’s air and ocean temperatures.
