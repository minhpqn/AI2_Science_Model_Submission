1 kilometer (km) = 1000 m
1 hectometer (hm) = 100 m
1 dekameter (dam) = 10 m
1 meter (m)
1 decimeter (dm) = 0.1 m
1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 m
1 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 m
1 micrometer (μm) = 10 -6 m
1 nanometer (nm) = 10 -9 m
1 picometer (pm) = 10 -12 m
When working with small numbers, we use a negative exponent.  So 0.1 meters is 1 × 10 -1 meters, 0.01 is 1 × 10 -2 and so forth.  Table above gives examples of smaller units.  Note the use of the leading zero (the zero to the left of the decimal point).
That digit is there to help you see the decimal point more clearly.  The figure 0.01 is less likely to be misunderstood than .01 where you may not see the decimal.
Scientific notation allows us to express very large or very small numbers in a convenient way.
This notation uses a coefficient (a number between 1 and 10) and a power of ten sufficient for the actual number.
