Atoms may share or transfer valence electrons.
Shared electrons bind atoms together to form chemical compounds.
You can see all of these ideas in action at the following URL (scroll down to the animation at the bottom of the Web page).
Energy levels and electrons
Q:
If an atom has 12 electrons, how will they be distributed in energy levels?
A:
The atom will have two electrons at the first energy level, eight at the second energy level, and the remaining two at the third energy level.
Q:
Sometimes, an electron jumps from one energy level to another.
How do you think this happens?
A:
To change energy levels, an electron must either gain or lose energy.
Thatâ€™s because electrons at higher energy levels have more energy than electrons at lower energy levels.
Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up the atom.
They are extremely small and have an electric charge of -1.
All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons.
Negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus.
This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving around the nucleus.
The region where an electron is most likely to be found is called an orbital.
