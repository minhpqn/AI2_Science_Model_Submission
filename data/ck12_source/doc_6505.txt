Invest in uranium!
Uranium is going to be worth more on the open market after a steep decline in prices several years ago.
So people are out there looking for more uranium.
But they are not waving Geiger counters around to find this material.
All the surface uranium has been found.
Instead, they must study geology, such as the rocks in the picture above.
Deep holes are drilled to explore the underground geology of a site and the rocks obtained are chemically analyzed.
No more clicking – just modern-day geology and chemistry.
Detection of Radioactivity
Radioactivity is determined by measuring the number of decay processes per unit time.
Perhaps the easiest way is simply to determine the number of counts/minute, with each count measuring a single decay process, such as the emission of an α-particle.
A particular isotope may have an activity of 5,000 counts/minute (cpm) while another isotope might only have 250 cpm.
The amount of activity gives a rough indication of the amount of the radioisotope present – the higher the activity, the more radioactive isotope in the sample.
Units of measurement
The curie (Ci) is one measure of the rate of decay (named after Pierre and Marie Curie).
One curie is equivalent to 3.7 × 10 10 disintegrations per second.
Since this is obviously a large and unwieldy number, radiation is often expressed in millicuries or microcuries (still very large numbers).
Another measure is the becquerel (Bq) , named after Henri Becquerel.
The becquerel is defined as an activity of one disintegration/second.
