Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection .
In natural selection, some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do.
Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things.
The theory of evolution by natural selection explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth.
No evidence has been identified that proves this theory is incorrect.
More on the theory of evolution will be presented in additional concepts.
The Cell Theory
The cell theory is another important scientific theory of biology.
According to the cell theory , the cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms, all living organisms are made up of at least one cell, and living cells always come from other living cells.
Once again, no evidence has been identified that proves this theory is incorrect.
More on the cell theory will be presented in additional concepts.
The Germ Theory
The germ theory of disease, also called the pathogenic theory of medicine, is a scientific theory that proposes that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases.
Like the other scientific theories, lots of evidence has been identified that supports this theory, and no evidence has been identified that proves the theory is incorrect.
With repeated testing, some hypotheses may eventually become scientific theories.
A scientific theory is a broad explanation for events that is widely accepted as true.
Evolution is a change species over time.
Evolution occurs by natural selection.
The cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells, and living cells always come from other living cells.
The germ theory proposes that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases.
