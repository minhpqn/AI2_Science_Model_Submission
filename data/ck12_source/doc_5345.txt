codon :
A sequence of three nucleotides within mRNA; encodes for a specific amino acid or termination (stop) sequence.
mRNA :
Messenger RNA; serves as a nucleic acid intermediate between the nucleus and the ribosomes.
ribosome :
A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).
rRNA :
Ribosomal RNA; together with proteins, forms ribosomes.
stop codon :
A codon that does not have a corresponding tRNA (does not code for an amino acid); signals the end of translation; also known as a termination codon;
UAG, UGA, and UAA.
transcription :
The process of making mRNA from the information in the DNA (gene) sequence.
translation :
The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.
tRNA :
Transfer RNA; brings an amino acid to the ribosome.
There are three types of RNA: mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.
mRNA is the intermediary between the nucleus, where the DNA lives, and the cytoplasm, where proteins are made.
rRNA and tRNA are involved in protein synthesis.
