Answer:
In order to calculate voltage across a resistor, use Ohmâ€™s law.
V_{90\:\Omega} &= I_{90\:\Omega}R_{90\:\Omega}=(0.2\:A)(90\:\Omega)=18\:V\\\V_{10\:\Omega} &= I_{10\:\Omega}R_{10\:\Omega}=(0.2\:A)(10\:\Omega)=2\:V
^* Note:
If you add up the voltages across the individual resistors you will obtain the total voltage of the circuit, as you should.
Further note that with the voltages we can use the original form of the Power equation (P=IV) , and we should get the same results as above.
P_{90\:\Omega} &= I_{90\:\Omega}V_{90\:\Omega}=(18\:V)(0.2\:A)=3.6\:W\\\P_{10\:\Omega} &= I_{10\:\Omega}V_{10\:\Omega}=(2.0\:V)(0.2\:A)=0.4\:W
