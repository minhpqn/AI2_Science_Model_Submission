telophase :
Last stage of mitosis during which chromosomes uncoil to form chromatin, the spindle breaks down, and new nuclear membranes form.
Mitosis is the division of the nucleus.
Mitosis is the division of the nucleus; five distinct phases of mitosis have been recognized: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm.
Cytokinesis occurs after mitosis.
At the end of cytokinesis there are two genetically identical daughter cells.
Animal Cell Mitosis at  .
Order the phases of mitosis.
Describe the main processes involved in mitosis.
Differentiate cytokinesis in animal and plant cells.
Four phases of mitosis: can you describe what happens in each phase?
Cell Cycle Regulation - Advanced
Describe how the cell cycle is controlled/regulated.
What would happen if this cycle proceeds at will?
Your cells may grow and divide without performing their necessary functions, or without fully replicating their DNA, or without copying their organelles.
Probably not much good could come of that.
So the cell cycle needs to be highly regulated and tightly controlled.
And it is.
Control of the Cell Cycle
