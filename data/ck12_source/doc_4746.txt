Explain a complex chemistry.
Describe the importance of homeostasis.
What do a bacterium and a whale have in common?
Do they share characteristics with us?
All living organisms, from the smallest bacterium to the largest whale, share certain characteristics of life.
For example, all living things are made of cells and they must reproduce to make the next generation.
Without these characteristics, there is no life .
Characteristics of Life
Biology examines the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living things.
It classifies and describes organisms, their functions, how species come into existence, and the interactions they have with each other and with the natural environment.
Four unifying principles form the foundation of modern biology: cell theory, evolution, genetics and homeostasis.
A powerful introductory video, Characteristics of Life, choreographed to dramatic music, highlighting the wonder of life, and how it is defined can be seen at  (3:40).

Most biological sciences are specialized areas of study.
Biology includes biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, immunology, genetics, physiology, zoology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and botany.
Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals that make up life.
Cell biology is the study of life at the level of the cell.
Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms.
Immunology is the study of an organism's resistance to disease.
Genetics is the study of how organisms pass traits to their offspring.
