In the current example, the equation is now balanced.
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)+3\text{CO}(g) \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}(s)+3\text{CO}_2(g)
Blast furnaces reduce Iron 3+ into iron metal using carbon monoxide
A blast furnace is where iron ore is processed and turned into iron metal.
First, air is blown through a mixture of iron ore and coke (carbon).
The carbon monoxide produced reduces the Fe 3+ ions in the iron ore to metallic iron.
The oxidation number-change method of balancing redox equations is described.
Balance the equations at the link below:
Why is it important to assign oxidation numbers to all the atoms in the equation?
What are we really balancing using this method?
What do we adjust to make electrons gained equal electrons lost?
oxidation-number change method:
A method of balancing redox equations by determining oxidation number changes.

Half-Reaction Method
Balance redox equations using the half-reaction method.
Dichromate salts often serve as oxidizing agents
What makes the paint color orange?
The picture above shows one of the two Thunder Dolphin amusement ride trains.
This train has an orange stripe while its companion train has a yellow stripe.
