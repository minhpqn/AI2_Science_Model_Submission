Maria and terrae cover the Moon
Maria (the dark areas) and terrae (the light areas) cover the Moon.
The lighter parts on the Moon are called terrae , or highlands ( Figure above ).
They are higher than the maria and include several high mountain ranges.
The rock that makes up the highlands is mostly composed of feldspar, which is lighter in color and crystallized more slowly than the maria.
The rock looks light because it reflects more of the Sun’s light.
The figure below shows the near and far sides of the Moon ( Figure below ).
They are different!
The near and far side of the Moon
The Mare Moscoviense is one of the few maria, or dark, flat areas, on the far side.
The rocks of the terrae formed while the lunar magma ocean cooled just after the Moon formed.
The maria formed later.
There are no lakes, rivers, or even small puddles anywhere to be found on the Moon's surface.
So there is no running water and no atmosphere.
This means that there is no erosion.
Natural processes continually alter Earth’s surface.
Without these processes, our planet’s surface would be covered with meteorite craters just like the Moon.
Many moons in our solar system have cratered surfaces.
NASA scientists have discovered a large number of water molecules mixed in with lunar dirt.
There is also surface water ice in some of the frigid places that are always in shadow.
