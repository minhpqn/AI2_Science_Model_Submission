Single antibody illustrated
An antibody matches only one type of antigen.
Most plasma cells live for just a few days, but some of them live much longer.
They may even survive for the lifetime of the individual.
Long-living plasma cells are called memory cells.
They retain a “memory” of a specific pathogen long after an infection is over.
They help launch a rapid response against the pathogen if it invades the body again in the future.
Activated B cells produce antibodies to a particular antigen.
Memory B cells remain in the body after the immune response is over and provide immunity to pathogens bearing the antigen.
