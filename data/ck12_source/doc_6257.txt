The change in temperature can be calculated using the specific heat equation.
\Delta{T}=\frac{q}{c_p \times m}=\frac{813 \text{ J}}{4.18 \text{ J/g}^\circ \text{C} \times 60.0 \text{ g}}=3.24^\circ \text{C}
Since the water was being cooled, the temperature decreases.
The final temperature is:
T_f=23.52^\circ \text{C} - 3.24^\circ \text{C}=20.28^\circ \text{C}
Specific heat calculations are illustrated.
Work the problems at the link below:
Do different materials have different specific heats?
How does mass affect heat absorbed?
If we know the specific heat of a material, can we determine how much heat is released under a given set of circumstances?
specific heat:
The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1Â°C.
List factors that influence enthalpy.
While a catalyst changes activation energy, enthalpy remains unchanged
Does the catalyst affect enthalpy?
The factors influencing a reaction are complicated and varied.
Since a catalyst affects activation energy, we might assume it would have some sort of impact on enthalpy, but it does not.
The change in enthalpy of a reaction depends solely on the chemical compositions of the reactants and products, not on the path taken to get from one to the other.
Heat changes in chemical reactions are most often measured in the laboratory under conditions in which the reacting system is open to the atmosphere.
In that case, the system is at a constant pressure.
