How do you make nitric acid?
Nitric acid has many uses in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives.
Most nitric acid is manufactured from ammonia using a three-step process.
The ammonia is oxidized to HNO 3 through the formation of several nitrogen oxides, finally resulting in the acid.
Redox Reactions and Ionic Compounds
In the course of a chemical reaction between a metal and a nonmetal, electrons are transferred from the metal atoms to the nonmetal atoms.
For example, when zinc metal is mixed with sulfur and heated, the compound zinc sulfide is produced.
Two valence electrons from each zinc atom are transferred to each sulfur atom.
Zinc donates two of its valence electrons to sulfur to form zinc sulfide
Reaction between zinc and sulfur.
Since the zinc is losing electrons in the reaction, it is being oxidized.
The sulfur is gaining electrons and is thus being reduced.
An oxidation-reduction reaction is a reaction that involves the full or partial transfer of electrons from one reactant to another.
Oxidation is the full or partial loss of electrons or the gain of oxygen.
Reduction is the full or partial gain of electrons or the loss of oxygen.
A redox reaction is another term for an oxidation-reduction reaction.
Each of these processes can be shown in a separate equation called a half-reaction.
A half-reaction is an equation that shows either the oxidation or the reduction reaction that occurs during a redox reaction.
&\text{Oxidation:} \ \text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}+2e^- \\& \text{Reduction:} \ \text{S}+2e^- \rightarrow \text{S}^{2-}
It is important to remember that the two half-reactions occur simultaneously.
