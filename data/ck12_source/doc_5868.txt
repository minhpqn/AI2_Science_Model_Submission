The red and white spheres are oxygen and hydrogen atoms respectively, which are bonded together to form hydroxide ions (OH −
Names and Formulas of Bases
There is no special system for naming bases.  Since they all contain the OH - anion, names of bases end in hydroxide .  The cation is simply named first.  Some examples of names and formulas for bases are shown in the Table below .
NH 4 OH
Notice that because bases are ionic compounds, the number of hydroxides in the formula does not affect the name.  The compound must be neutral, so the charges of the ions are balanced just as for other ionic compounds.  Sodium ion (Na + ) requires one OH - ion to balance the charge, so the formula is NaOH.  Calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) requires two OH - ions to balance the charge, so the formula is Ca(OH) 2 .
Hydroxide ion is a polyatomic ion and must be put in parentheses when there are more than on in a formula.
Bases are ionic compounds that produce hydroxide ions when dissolved in water.
The cation is named first followed by “hydroxide.”
