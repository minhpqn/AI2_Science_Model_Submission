hypertonic :
In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with the lower solute concentration.
isotonic :
Solutions of equal solute concentration.
osmosis :
The diffusion of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane.
osmotic pressure :
Pressure exerted on a cell wall due to osmosis of water into a cell.
plasmolysis :
The process where the cytoplasm pulls away from the cell wall due to the loss of water through osmosis; occurs in plant cells.
solute :
The substance that is dissolved in a solvent.
solution :
Mixture that has the same composition throughout; mixture of a solute in a solvent.
solvent :
A substance that dissolves another substance to form a solution.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane and down a concentration gradient.
They can move into or out of a cell, depending on the concentration of the solute.
How does osmosis differ from diffusion?
What would cause the central vacuole of a plant cell to shrunk and become smaller than normal?
