Human Uses of Fungi
Describe how fungi are important to humans.
What would happen if there were no fungi?
We'd be living in a huge trash pile!
All the fallen leaves, grass clippings, dead trees, and other organic waste would just build up.
Fungi are important decomposers in the environment.
Not only do they get rid of wastes, they make the nutrients in the wastes available to other organisms.
This is just one way that fungi are important to us.
Fungi are extremely important to the ecosystem because they are one of the major decomposers of organic material.
Decomposing organic material is how fungi acquire energy.
But fungi have other roles in addition to being decomposers.
How do fungi help people?
They are used to help prepare food and beverages, and they have many other uses.
