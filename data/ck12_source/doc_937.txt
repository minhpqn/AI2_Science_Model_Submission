Define atomic number.
Define mass number.
State the charge and mass of a nucleus.
Given the atomic and mass numbers of a nuclide, find the numbers of protons, electrons, and neutrons.
Illustration of an atom
The nuclei of atoms contain protons and neutrons while electron clouds surrounding the nuclei contain  the electrons .
The positively charged protons are very close together in an atomic nucleus and the repulsive force of the like charges is tremendous.
The strong force is a type of interaction that binds together protons and neutrons.
Without the strong force, the positively charged protons would blow the nucleus apart.
Until 1932, the positively charged nucleus  of an atom was known to exist, but it was believed to contain only protons.
The nucleus was known to be surrounded by enough negatively charged electrons to make the atom electrically neutral.
Most of the atom was empty space, with its mass concentrated in the tiny nucleus.
Twelve years earlier, Lord Ernest Rutherford, a pioneer in atomic structure, had postulated the existence of a third, neutral, sub-atomic particle, with the approximate mass of a proton, that could result from the capture of an electron by a proton.
This postulation stimulated a search for the particle.
However, its electrical neutrality complicated the search because almost all experimental techniques of this period measured charged particles.
James Chadwick bombarded hydrogen atoms in paraffin with beryllium emissions.
By comparing the energies of recoiling charged particles from different targets, he proved that the beryllium emissions contained a neutral component with a mass approximately equal to that of the proton.
He called it the neutron in a paper published in 1932.
Since the identification of the neutron, the model of the atomic nucleus has changed very little.
According to this model, a nucleus is considered to be an aggregate of protons and neutrons.
