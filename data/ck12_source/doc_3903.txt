Describe the ecosystems at hydrothermal vents.

Give an example of plankton, nekton, and benthos.
What are phytoplankton and zooplankton?
Describe predation and its effects on population size and evolution.
Define a keystone species.
Describe the use of camouflage as an adaptation.
What may be the most common way different species interact?
Biomes as different as deserts and wetlands share something very important.
All biomes have populations of interacting species.
Species interact in the same basic ways in all biomes.
For example, all biomes have some species that prey on others for food.
Predation is a relationship in which members of one species (the predator ) consume members of another species (the prey ).
The lionesses and zebra in Figure below are classic examples of predators and prey.
In addition to the lionesses, there is another predator in this figure.
Can you spot it?
The other predator is the zebra.
