Hibernation may last for weeks or months.
Animals that hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and snakes.
Most people think that bears hibernate.
In fact, bears do not go into true hibernation.
In the winter, they go into a deep sleep.
However, their body processes do not slow down very much.
Their body temperature also remains about the same as usual.
Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep.
Another example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is migration .
Migration is the movement of animals from one place to another.
Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the environment.
For example, animals may migrate when the days get shorter in the fall.
Migration is most common in birds, fish, and insects.
In the Northern Hemisphere, many species of birds, including robins and geese, travel south for the winter.
They migrate to areas where it is warmer and where there is more food.
They return north in the spring.
A flock of migrating geese is pictured below ( Figure below ).
