After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary.
This is called ovulation , which usually occurs at the midpoint of a monthly cycle.
In a 28 day cycle, ovulation would occur around day 14.
The moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube  then sweep the egg into the tube.
At this time, if sperm are present the egg can be fertilized.
This diagram illustrates how an egg and its follicle develop in an ovary
This diagram shows how an egg and its follicle develop in an ovary.
After it develops, the egg leaves the ovary and enters the fallopian tube. (1) Undeveloped eggs, (2) Egg and follicle developing, (3) Egg and follicle developing, (4) Ovulation.
After ovulation, what remains of the follicle is known as the corpus luteum, which degenerates (5,
Fertilization occurs if a sperm enters the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube.
When this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis.
This results in two daughter cells that are different in size.
The smaller cell is called a polar body .
It contains very little cytoplasm.
It soon breaks down and disappears.
The larger cell is the egg.
It contains most of the cytoplasm.
This will develop into a child.
Eggs are female gametes that form in the ovaries and are released into the fallopian tubes.
The eggs are formed before a baby girl is born, but these eggs are not fully developed.
