Compare and contrast exponential and logistic growth.
Define carrying capacity.
Distinguish K -selected from r -selected species.
What starts out very small and has the potential to grow considerably larger?
Trees, of course.
But also populations.
Give a population everything it needs to survive, and the growth of that population will be tremendous.
Patterns of Population Growth
Populations may show different patterns of growth.
The growth pattern depends partly on the conditions under which a population lives.
Under ideal conditions, populations of most species can grow at exponential rates.
Curve A in Figure below represents exponential growth .
The population starts out growing slowly.
As population size increases, the growth rate also increases.
The larger the population becomes, the faster it grows.
Graph of exponential versus logistic growth
Exponential and Logistic Growth.
Curve A shows exponential growth.
Curve B shows logistic growth.
Most populations do not live under ideal conditions.
