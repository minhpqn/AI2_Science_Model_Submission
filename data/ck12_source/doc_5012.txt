Metabolism - Advanced
This caterpillar is busily munching its way through leaf after leaf.
In fact, caterpillars do little more than eat, day and night.
Like all living things, they need food to provide their cells with energy.
The caterpillar will soon go through an amazing transformation to become a beautiful butterfly.
These changes require a lot of energy.
Like this caterpillar and all other living things, you need energy to power everything you do.
Whether itâ€™s running a race or blinking an eye, it takes energy.
In fact, every cell of your body constantly needs energy to carry out life processes.
You probably know that you get energy from the food you eat, but where does food come from?
How does it come to contain energy, and how do your cells get the energy from food?
When you read this chapter, you will learn the answers to these questions.
