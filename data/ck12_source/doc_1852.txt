They may be carried great distances and rise high above the ground.
Larger particles, such as sand, move by saltation .
The wind blows them in short hops.
They stay close to the ground.
Particles larger than sand move by creep .
The wind rolls or pushes them over the surface.
They stay on the ground.
Diagram of how wind can transport particles
Wind transports particles in different ways depending on their size.
Dust storms ( Figure below ) are more common in dry climates.
The soil is dried out and dusty.
Plants may be few and far between.
Dry, bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than wetter soil or soil held in place by plant roots.

When winds whip up in the desert, they can create tremendous dust storms.
Wind blows small particles away.
As a result, the ground surface gets lower and rockier; this is called deflation .
The rocks that are left are called desert pavement .
Desert pavement is a surface covered by gravel-sized particles that are not easily moved by wind.
Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it?
