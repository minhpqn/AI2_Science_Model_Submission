Q:
With six valence electrons, group 16 elements need to attract two electrons from another element to have a stable electron arrangement of eight valence electrons.
Which group of elements in the periodic table do you think might form compounds with elements in group 16?
A:
Group 2 elements, called the alkaline Earth metals, form compounds with elements in the oxygen group.
That’s because group 2 elements have two valence electrons that they are “eager” to give up.
An example of a group 2 and group 6 compound is calcium oxide (CaO).
Groups 13–16 of the periodic table contain one or more metalloids, in addition to metals, nonmetals, or both.
Group 13 is called the boron group, and boron is the only metalloid in this group.
The other group 13 elements are metals.
Group 14 is called the carbon group.
This group contains two metalloids: silicon and germanium.
Carbon is a nonmetal, and the remaining elements in this group are metals.
Group 15 is called the nitrogen group.
The metalloids in this group are arsenic and antimony.
Group 15 also contains two nonmetals and one metal.
Group 16 is called the oxygen group.
Tellurium is the only metalloid in this group, which also contains three nonmetals and one metal.
