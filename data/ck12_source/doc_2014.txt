This land was then developed with roads, golf courses, and buildings.
Now we know that wetlands are very important.
Laws have been passed to help protect them.
Why are wetlands so important?
Wetlands have great biodiversity.
They provide homes or breeding sites to a huge variety of species.
Because so much wetland area has been lost, many of these species are endangered.
Wetlands purify water.
They filter sediments and toxins from runoff before it enters rivers, lakes, and oceans.
Wetlands slow rushing water.
During hurricanes and other extreme weather, wetlands reduce the risk of floods.
Although the rate of loss has slowed, wetlands are still being destroyed today.
The conditions that affect lake ecosystems are similar to those that affect ocean ecosystems.
These include light penetration, temperature, and water depth.
Wetlands are lands that are wet for a significant portion of the year.
Wetlands are extremely important as an ecosystem and as a filter for pollutants.
