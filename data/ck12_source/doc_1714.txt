Is the current drought like the Dust Bowl?
The worst heat wave in U.S. history came in 1936.
The already struggling Midwest was hit hard by extreme temperatures and drought.
Crops were destroyed, and more than 5,000 people died.
The Midwest and Southwest are currently suffering with drought.
While serious, it is not yet a situation like the Dust Bowl.
A heat wave is different depending on its location.
A region has a heat wave if it has more than five consecutive days of temperatures that are more than 9 o F (5 o C) above average.
A heat wave in Portland, Oregon might be just an average warm week in Phoenix, Arizona.
Heat waves have increased in frequency and duration in recent years.
The summer 2011 North American heat wave brought record temperatures across the Midwestern and Eastern United States.
Many states and localities broke records for temperature and for the most days above 100 o F.
A high pressure cell sitting over a region with no movement is the likely cause of a heat wave.
What do you think caused the heat wave in the image below ( Figure below )?
A high pressure zone kept the jet stream farther north than normal for August.

The bright yellow areas are the hottest, and the blue and white are coolest.
Droughts also depend on what is normal for a region.
A region that gets significantly less precipitation than normal for an extended period of time is in drought.
