The scale measures the force with which gravity pulls an object downward.
To delve a little deeper into weight and gravity, watch this video:
Weight being measured with a scale
Gravity has traditionally been defined as a force of attraction between things that have mass.
The strength of gravity between two objects depends on their mass and their distance apart.
Earthâ€™s gravity constantly pulls matter toward the center of the planet.
It also keeps moons and satellites orbiting Earth and Earth orbiting the sun.
Weight measures the force of gravity pulling on an object.
The SI unit for weight is the Newton (N).
