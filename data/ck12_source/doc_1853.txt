Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and debris.
Wind-blown sand has the same effect.
It scours and polishes rocks and other surfaces.
Wind-blown sand may carve rocks into interesting shapes ( Figure below ).
This form of erosion is called abrasion.
It occurs any time rough sediments are blown or dragged over surfaces.
Can you think of other ways abrasion might occur?
Rock formation created due to wind erosion
This incredible rock formation in Utah is the result of wind erosion.
Exposed rocks in desert areas often develop a dark brown or black coating called desert varnish ( Figure below ).
Wind transports clay-sized particles that chemically react with other substances at high temperatures.
The coating is formed of iron and manganese oxides.
Petroglyphs carved into desert varnish
Ancient people carved these petroglyphs into desert varnish at Sego Canyon, Utah.
Wind moves sediments by suspension, saltation, or creep.
In deserts, wind picks up small particles and leaves behind larger rocks.
This forms desert pavement.
Moving sand may sand blast rocks and other materials causing abrasion.
