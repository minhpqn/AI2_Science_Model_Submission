This is described in the chapter Plate Tectonics .
Papers held up by rising air currents above a radiator demonstrate the important principle that warm air rises.
Air temperature changes with altitude.
This does not occur in the same way as pressure and density, which decrease with altitude.
Changes in air temperature are not regular.
A change in temperature with distance is called a temperature gradient .
Temperature of the Atmosphere
Air temperature changes as altitude increases.
In some layers of the atmosphere, the temperature decreases.
In other layers, it increases ( Figure below ).
Refer to this figure as you read about the layers in the coming concepts.
How does air temperature change in the layer closest to Earth?
Warm air rises, cool air sinks.
Warm air has lower density.
Different layers of the atmosphere have different temperature gradients.
Temperature gradient is the change in temperature with distance.
