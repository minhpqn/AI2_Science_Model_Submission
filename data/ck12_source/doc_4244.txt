Different types of behavior evolved in animals because the behaviors helped them survive or reproduce.
In many species, animals live together in a close-knit group with other members of their species.
Such a group is referred to as a society .
Animals that live in a society are known as social animals .
They live and work together for the good of the group.
This is called cooperation .
Generally, each member of the group has a specific role that it plays in the society.
Cooperation allows the group to do many things that a lone animal could never do.
Look at the ants in Figure below .
By working together, they are able to carry a large insect back to the nest to feed other members of their society.
Cooperation in a Social Insect.
These ants are cooperating in a task that a single ant would be too small to do alone.
For individuals to cooperate, they need to communicate .
Animals can communicate with sounds, chemicals, or visual cues.
For example, to communicate with sounds, birds sing and frogs croak.
Both may be communicating that they are good mates.
Ants communicate with chemicals called pheromones .
For example, they use the chemicals to mark trails to food sources so other ants can find them.
Male dogs use pheromones in urine to mark their territory.
They are “telling” other dogs to stay out of their yard.
