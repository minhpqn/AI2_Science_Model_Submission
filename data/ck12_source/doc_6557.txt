The anesthetic effects of ethers were first discovered in the 1840s.
Diethyl ether was used as a general anesthetic for patients undergoing surgery for many years.
However, ethers are very flammable and have undesirable side effects such as nausea and vomiting.
Safer alternatives to ethers are now used in anesthesia and the primary use of ethers today is as a solvent for other organic compounds.
The structure and nomenclature of ethers is given.
Uses for ethers are described.
