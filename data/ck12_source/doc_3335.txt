You’ve probably heard of Silicon Valley.
You may even know that it’s a region in northern California.
But do you know how the region got its name?
Silicon Valley is the birthplace of modern electronics and continues to be a hub of electronic innovation.
The word silicon in the name refers to the element silicon, which is the chief “ingredient” of electronic components.
What Are Electronic Components?
Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as computers.
The components change electric current so it can carry information.
Types of electronic components include diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits, all of which you can read about below.
However, to understand how these components work, you first need to know about semiconductors.
That’s because electronic components consist of semiconductors—sometimes millions of them!
A semiconductor is a solid crystal, consisting mainly of silicon.
It gets its name from the fact that it can conduct current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor.
As you can see in the Figure below , each silicon atom has four valence electrons that it shares with other silicon atoms in the crystal.
A semiconductor is formed by replacing a few silicon atoms with other atoms, such as phosphorus or boron, which have more or less valence electrons than silicon.
This is called doping, and it’s what allows the semiconductor to conduct electric current.
Semiconductors are created by "doping" silicon
Q:
Why wouldn’t a pure silicon crystal be able to conduct electric current?
A:
