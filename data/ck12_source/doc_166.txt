Introduction to Physics
Definition of Physics
State a definition of physics.
Explain the importance of physics as a field of study.
An antenna depends on the interaction of matter and energy to function, making it a perfect example of physics in action
Physics is more than calculating the momentum of billiard balls hitting each other or the friction acting on a speeding carâ€™s tires.
Physics includes the study of practically every form of matter and how it interacts with other matter and with energy in various forms.
The image shows one of several large parabolic antennas that NASA physicists used for years to communicate with ships and devices completing solar system exploration missions.
Definition of Physics
What is physics ?
Physics is the branch of science that studies the physical world, including objects as small as subatomic particles and as large as galaxies.
It studies the nature of matter and energy and how they interact.
Physicists are inquisitive people who want to know the causes of what they see.
How does the moon move?
Why does the moon move?
Why do the stars shine?
Why do your hands get warm when you rub them together?
Physicists, like all scientists, hope to find explanations that describe more than one phenomenon and offer a better understanding of how the universe works.
People commonly believe that physics is all about solving word problems and memorizing equations.
While it is true that many physics classes focus on the equations, it is important to remember that the purpose of physics is less about the problems and more about using equations, laws, and theories to understand the world we live in.
