The first stage of prophase I is the leptotene stage.
During this stage, chromatin condenses into visible (under the microscope) chromosomes within the nucleus.
Each chromosome contains two sister chromatids, and each chromosome has a homologue present in the nucleus.
During this stage, the synaptonemal complex begins to assemble.
The zygotene stage occurs as the chromosomes pair with their homologue forming homologous chromosome pairs, a process called synapsis .
Homologous chromosomes are equal in size and genetic content, so the genes from the two chromosomes line up along the length of the chromosome.
Therefore, the pairing is highly specific and exact.
The paired chromosomes are called bivalent or tetrad chromosomes, as they are formed by a complex with four chromatids.
The pachytene stage is the stage when chromosomal crossover (crossing-over) occurs.
This is the process where non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange segments over regions of homology.
At the sites of genetic exchange, chiasmata form.
This exchange of DNA results in genetic recombination , the formation of new combinations of alleles.
This process is much more common in autosomes than in sex chromosomes.
The diplotene stage is when the synaptonemal complex degrades and homologous chromosomes disassociate slightly from each other, though they are still bound at the chiasmata (the regions of recombination).
In human fetal oogenesis, all developing oocytes develop to this stage and the stop.
This happens in all females prior to birth.
This suspended state of the oocytes is referred to as the dictyotene stage and the eggs remains in this stage until released following puberty.
During the diakinesis stage, chromosomes further condense.
The chiasmata remain intact during this stage.
The remainder of this stage is similar to prometaphase of mitosis: the nucleoli disappear, the nuclear membrane disintegrates, and the meiotic spindle begins to form.
