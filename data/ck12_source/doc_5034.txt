We will divide the process into two basic sets of reactions, known as the light reactions, which of course uses sunlight, and the Calvin cycle, which uses carbon dioxide.
As you study the details, refer frequently to the chemical equation of photosynthesis.
In the first stage, youâ€™ll discover how chloroplasts transform light energy, and why we owe our ability to breathe to plants!
chlorophyll :
The primary pigment of photosynthesis; found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
chloroplast :
The organelle of photosynthesis; site of photosynthesis.
electron carrier :
Molecules that accept and temporarily hold high-energy electrons.
electron transport chain :
Series of electron-transport molecules that pass high-energy electrons from molecule to molecule and capture their energy.
grana (singular: granum ):
Structure within the chloroplast; consists of stacks of sac-like thylakoid membranes.
photosystems :
Group of molecules, including chlorophyll, in the thylakoid membrane of a chloroplast; captures light energy.
pigment molecules :
Molecules that absorb specific wavelengths (colors) of light.
stroma :
Space outside the thylakoid membranes of a chloroplast; site of the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis.
Theory of Endosymbiosis :
