An example of one is pictured below ( Figure below ).
Bathymetric maps are made of any water body, including lakes and oceans.
On these maps, the contour lines represent depth below the surface.
Therefore, high numbers are deeper depths and low numbers are shallow depths.
Bathymetric maps are made from depth soundings or sonar data.
They help oceanographers understand the shape of bottoms of lakes, bays, and the ocean.
This information also helps boaters navigate safely.

Scientists need to sample seawater (or lake water) from different depths.
To sample seawater, bottles are placed along a cable at regular depths ( Figure below ).
When they are in position, a weight is dropped down the cable.
This closes the bottles.
The water trapped in the bottle can be analyzed in a laboratory.
This allows scientists to understand ocean or lake chemistry.

Scientists also collect rock and sediment samples from the seafloor.
A dredge is a giant rectangular bucket that is dragged along behind a ship.
The dredge picks up loose rocks lying on the seafloor.
