They can also perform many other tasks for a disabled person, depending on the type of disability.
Importance of Mammals
Mammals play many important roles in ecosystems, and they also benefit people.
Importance to Ecosystems
Mammals have important roles in the food webs of practically every ecosystem.
Mammals are important members of food chains and food webs, as grazers and predators.
Mammals can feed at various levels of food chains, as herbivores, insectivores, carnivores and omnivores.
Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic relationships.
For example, bats have established mutually beneficial relationships with plants.
Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat from each flower, and, in return, they pollinate the flowers.
That means they transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing the plant to reproduce.
Non-flying mammalian pollinators include marsupials, primates, and rodents.
In most cases, these animals visit flowers to eat their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies.
When the animal visits another flower to eat the nectar, the pollen is transferred to that flower.
Fruit-eating bats ( Figure below ) also receive food from plants.
In return, they help these plants spread their seeds.
When bats consume fruit, they also consume the seeds within the fruit.
Then they carry the seeds in their guts to far-away locations.
Zebras have been known to befriend ostriches.
In this symbiotic relationship, both species benefit.
