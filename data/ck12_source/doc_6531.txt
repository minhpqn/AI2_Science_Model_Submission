Carbon has the ability to bond to itself repeatedly, making long chains of carbon atoms as well as ringed structures.
These bonds can be single, double, or triple covalent bonds.
Carbon readily makes covalent bonds with other elements, primarily hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, and several other nonmetals.
The figure below shows ball-and-stick models of two of the many organic compounds.
Structure of stearic acid
Stearic acid is composed of many carbon (black) and hydrogen (white) atoms, along with two oxygen (red) atoms.
Structure of Methionine
Methionine is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen (blue), and sulfur (yellow) atoms.
The related field of biochemistry overlaps to some extent with organic chemistry.
Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of living systems.
Many biochemical compounds are considered to be organic chemicals.
Both of the molecules shown above are biochemical materials in terms of their use in the body, but organic chemicals in terms of their structure and chemical reactivity.
Growing Nanotube Forests
What if we could grow elevators to space?
Or make phones that last for weeks without a charge?
These things could someday be possible someday with an amazing material like carbon nanotubes.
