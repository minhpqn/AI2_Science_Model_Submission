When the archer releases the bowstring, the arrow will be flung forward toward the top of the target where she’s aiming.
But another force will also act on the arrow in a different direction.
The other force is gravity, and it will pull the arrow down toward Earth.
The two forces combined will cause the arrow to move in the curved path shown in the Figure below .
This type of motion is called projectile motion .
It occurs whenever an object curves down toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and the downward force of gravity acting on it.
A well aimed shot compensates for gravity
Because of projectile motion, to hit the bull’s eye of a target with an arrow, you actually have to aim for a spot above the bull’s eye.
You can see in the Figure below what happens if you aim at the bull’s eye instead of above it.
Aiming for the bull's eye will cause the arrow to miss the target
Another Example of Projectile Motion
You can probably think of other examples of projectile motion.
One is shown in the Figure below .
The cannon shoots a ball straight ahead, giving it horizontal motion.
At the same time, gravity pulls the ball down toward the ground.
This cannonball is pulled down by gravity
Q :
How would you show the force of gravity on the cannon ball in the Figure above ?
A :
You would add a line pointing straight down from the cannon to the ground.
