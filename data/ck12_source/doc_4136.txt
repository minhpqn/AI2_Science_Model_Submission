Imagine that human life cycles resembled those of the earliest plants.
If you think about this analogy, you may begin to realize that many plants, which appear so inert to our roving eyes and active minds, actually lead secret lives of surprising variety.
You know that humans develop, or gradually change, from infants to quite different, sexually mature adults.
You also know that meiosis in your own ovaries or testes produces haploid eggs or sperm, which must join in fertilization to become a new individual.
Each of us, of course, began as that single cell made when a sperm united with an egg.
