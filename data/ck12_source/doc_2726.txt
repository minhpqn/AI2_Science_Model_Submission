A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Q:
How can carbon achieve a full outer energy level?
A:
Carbon can form four covalent bonds.
Covalent bonds are chemical bonds that form between nonmetals.
In a covalent bond, two atoms share a pair of electrons.
By forming four covalent bonds, carbon shares four pairs of electrons, thus filling its outer energy level and achieving stability.
How Carbon Forms Bonds
A carbon atom can form covalent bonds with other carbon atoms or with the atoms of other elements.
Carbon often forms bonds with hydrogen.
Compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons.
Methane (CH 4 ), which is modeled in the Figure below , is an example of a hydrocarbon.
In methane, a single carbon atom forms covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms.
The diagram on the left in the Figure below shows all the shared valence electrons.
The diagram on the right in the Figure below , called a structural formula, represents each pair of shared electrons with a dash (â€“).

Carbon can form single, double, or even triple bonds with other carbon atoms.
In a single bond, two carbon atoms share one pair of electrons.
