In the series circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb won’t work because it won’t receive any current.
Series circuits are commonly used in flashlights.

Q:
If one light bulb burns out in this series circuit, how can you tell which bulb it is?
A:
It may not be obvious, because neither bulb will light if one is burned out.
You can tell which one it is only by replacing first one bulb and then the other to see which replacement results in both bulbs lighting up.
A circuit that has two loops is called a parallel circuit .
A simple parallel circuit is sketched below.
If one loop of a parallel circuit is interrupted, current can still flow through the other loop.
In the parallel circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb will still work because current can bypass the burned-out bulb.
The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits.

An electric circuit consists of one or two closed loops through which current can flow.
It has a voltage source and a conductor and may have other devices such as lights and switches.
A circuit that consists of one loop is called a series circuit.
If its single loop is interrupted at any point, no current can flow through the circuit.
A circuit that consists of two loops is called a parallel circuit.
If one loop of a parallel circuit is interrupted, current can still flow through the other loop.
