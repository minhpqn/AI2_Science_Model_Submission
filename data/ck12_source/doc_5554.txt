definite shape (rigid)
particles vibrate around fixed axes
If we were to cool liquid mercury to its freezing point of -39°C, and under the right pressure conditions, we would notice all of the liquid particles would go into the solid state.
The video below shows this process.

As you can see in the video, mercury can be solidified when its temperature is brought to its freezing point.
However, when returned to room temperature conditions, mercury does not exist in solid state for long, and returns back to its more common liquid form.
Three states of matter exist – solid, liquid, and gas.
Solids have a definite shape and volume.
Liquids have a definite volume, but take the shape of the container.
Gases have no definite shape or volume.
