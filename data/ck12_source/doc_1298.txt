When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome .
If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center.
Picture of an anticline
(A) An anticline is a convex upward fold. (B) This anticline is at Calico Ghost Town, California.
A syncline is a fold that bends downward ( Figure below ).
In a syncline, the youngest rocks are at the center.
The oldest rocks are at the outside edges.
When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is called a basin .
If the rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at the center.
Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin.
Picture of a syncline
(A) A syncline is a concave downward fold. (B) This syncline is seen at Calico Ghost Town near Barstow, California.
Rocks deform by compressive stress into folds.
A monocline is a simple bend in one-direction.
In an anticline, rocks arch upward.
A three-dimensional anticline is a dome.
In a syncline, rocks arch downward.
A three-dimensional syncline is a basin.
