Moving up the ladder increases your potential energy, while moving down the ladder decreases your energy.
Bohr’s work had a strong influence on our modern understanding of the inner workings of the atom.
However, his model worked well for an explanation for the emissions of the hydrogen atom, but was seriously limited when applied to other atoms.
Shortly after Bohr published his planetary model of the atom, several new discoveries were made, which resulted in, yet again, a revised view of the atom.
The Bohr model postulates that electrons orbit the nucleus at fixed energy levels.
Orbits further from the nucleus exist at higher energy levels.
When electrons return to a lower energy level, they emit energy in the form of light.
