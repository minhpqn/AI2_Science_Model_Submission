Current and Magnetism
Analyze and solve problems involving current carrying wires in magnetic fields.
Students will learn to analyze and solve problems involving current carrying wires in magnetic fields.
F_{\text{wire}}= LIB\sin(\theta) &&\text{Force on a Current Carrying Wire}
In this equation, L refers to the length of the wire, I to the electric current, B the magnitude of the magnetic field and  \theta is the angle between the direction of the current and the direction of the magnetic field.
B_{\text{wire}} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}&& \text{Magnetic field at a distance } r \text{ from a current-carrying wire}\\\text{Where } \mu_0=4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \;\text{Tm/A} &&\text{Permeability of Vacuum (approximately same for air also)}
Force on a Wire
Since a wire is nothing but a collection of moving charges, the force it will experience in a magnetic field will simply be the vector sum of the forces on the individual charges.
If the wire is straight --- that is, all the charges are moving in the same direction --- these forces will all point in the same direction, and so will their sum.
Then, the direction of the force can be found using the second right hand rule, while its magnitude will depend on the length of the wire (denoted   L ), the strength of the current, the strength of the field, and the angle between their directions:
Two current-carrying wires next to each other each generate magnetic fields and therefore exert forces on each other:

A wire loop and an infinitely long current carrying cable are placed a distance r apart.
The infinitely long wire is carrying a current I_1 to the left and the loop is carrying a current I_2 CCW.
The dimensions of the wire loop are shown in the diagram illustrating the situation below.
What is the magnitude and direction of the net force on the loop (the mass of the wires are negligible)?
In this problem, it is best to start by determining the direction of the force on each segment of the loop.
Based on the first right hand rule, the magnetic field from the infinite cable points into the page where the loop is.
