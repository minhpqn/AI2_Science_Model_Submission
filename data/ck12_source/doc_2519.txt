For example, some helium atoms have three neutrons instead of two.
Therefore, they have a different mass number than the one given in the Figure above .
Q:
What is the mass number of a helium atom that has three neutrons?
A:
The mass number is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons.
For helium atoms with three neutrons, the mass number is 2 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 5.
Q:
How would you represent this isotope of helium to show its atomic number and mass number?
A:
You would represent it by the element’s symbol and both numbers, with the mass number on top and the atomic number on the bottom:
Elements are pure substances that make up all matter, so each one is given a unique name.
The names of elements are also represented by unique one-, two-, or three- letter symbols.
The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number.
This is also unique for each element.
An atom’s mass number is its mass in atomic mass units (amu), which is about equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom.
Different isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons.
