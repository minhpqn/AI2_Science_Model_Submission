One roundworm parasite causes elephantiasis, a disease characterized by swelling of the limbs.
Most parasitic roundworm eggs or larvae are found in the soil and enter the human body when a person picks them up on the hands and then transfers them to the mouth.
The eggs or larvae also can enter the human body directly through the skin.
The best solution to these diseases is to try to prevent these diseases rather than treat or cure them.
Diseases caused by roundworms are more common in developing countries.
Many parasitic diseases caused by roundworms result from poor personal hygiene.
Contributing factors may include
lack of a clean water supply,
inadequate sanitation measures,
crowded living conditions, combined with a lack of access to health care and low levels of education.
Roundworms have a body cavity with internal organs and a simple nervous system.
