Answer:
Use Ohm’s Law (V=IR) but solve for current (I=V/R) .
I_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}=20V/2.91\Omega=0.69\ Amps
Question:
What is the power dissipated by the power supply?
Answer:
P=IV , so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current.
Thus, P_{total}=I_{total}V_{total}=(0.69A)(20V)=13.8W .
Question:
How much power is the 20\Omega resistor dissipating?
Answer:
The 20\Omega has the full 0.69Amps running through it because it is part of the ‘main river’ (this is not the case for the other resistors because the current splits).
P_{20 \Omega} = I^2_{20 \Omega} R_{20 \Omega} = (0.69A)^2 (20 \Omega) = 9.5W
Question:
If these resistors are light bulbs, order them from brightest to least bright.
Answer:
The brightness of a light bulb is directly given by the power dissipated.
So we could go through each resistor as we did the 20\Omega guy and calculate the power then simply order them.
But, we can also think it out.
For the guys in parallel the current splits with most of the current going through the 10\Omega path (less resistance) and less going through the 90\Omega+10\Omega path.
