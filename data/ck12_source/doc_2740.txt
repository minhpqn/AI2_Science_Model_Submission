Alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points, so some of them are solids at room temperature.
Shapes of Alkanes
Structural formulas are often used to represent hydrocarbon compounds because the molecules can have different shapes and a structural formula shows how the atoms are arranged.
Hydrocarbons may form straight chains, branched chains, or rings (see Figure below ).
You can read about each type below.
Alkanes can be both straight and branched molecules
A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train.
The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule.
B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone.
C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring.
Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules.
A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules.
Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds between carbon atoms.
As a result, each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes.
The name of specific alkanes always ends in –ane and has a prefix to indicate how many carbon atoms it has.
Hydrocarbons may form straight chains, branched chains, or rings.
Ring-shaped hydrocarbons are called cyclic hydrocarbons.
