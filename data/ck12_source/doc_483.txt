They needed to be able to spot colored fruits in the leafy background of the trees ( Figure below ).
They also had to be able to judge which fruits were ripe and which were still green.
Ripe fruits are usually red, orange, yellow, or purple.
Being able to see in color was important for finding food.
It was an adaptation that would help fruit-eating primates survive.
Color vision may have developed to help our ancestors distinguish between ripe and unripe fruits
With color vision, you can tell which cherries in this picture are ripe, because cherries turn red as they ripen.
Vision depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images, and then the brain must make sense of the images.
Humans can see in three dimensions and color.
