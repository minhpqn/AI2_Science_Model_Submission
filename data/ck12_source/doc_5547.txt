Drag racing car
Why are drag car standards constantly reinforced?
Drag racing is a highly competitive (and expensive) sport.
There are a variety of classes of vehicles, ranging from stock classes (depending on car weight, engine size, and degree of engine modification) all the way up to the Top Fuel class with weights of over two thousand pounds and capable of top speeds of well over 300 miles per hour at the end of the quarter-mile.
The standards for each class are well defined and frequent checks are made of engine dimensions and components to ensure that the rules are followed.
A physical property is a characteristic of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing the identity of the substance.
Silver is a shiny metal that conducts electricity very well.
It can be molded into thin sheets, a property called malleability.
Salt is dull and brittle and conducts electricity when it has been dissolved into water, which it does quite easily.
Physical properties of matter include color, hardness, malleability, solubility, electrical conductivity, density, melting points , and boiling points .
For the elements, color does not vary much from one element to the next.
The vast majority of elements are colorless, silver, or gray.
Some elements do have distinctive colors: sulfur and chlorine are yellow, copper is (of course) copper-colored, and elemental bromine is red.
Density can be a very useful parameter for identifying an element.
Of the materials that exist as solids at room temperature, iodine has a very low density compared to zinc, chromium, and tin.
Gold has a very high density, as does platinum.
