Usually, only the outermost bond breaks to release or spend energy for cellular work.
An ATP molecule, shown in the Figure below , is like a rechargeable battery: its energy can be used by the cell when it breaks apart into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate, and then the "worn-out battery" ADP can be recharged using new energy to attach a new phosphate and rebuild ATP.
The materials are recyclable, but recall that energy is not!
How much energy does it cost to do your bodyâ€™s work?
A single cell uses about 10 million ATP molecules per second, and recycles all of its ATP molecules about every 20-30 seconds.
Structure of ATP
An arrow shows the bond between two phosphate groups in an ATP molecule.
When this bond breaks, its chemical energy can do cellular work.
The resulting ADP molecule is recycled when new energy attaches another phosphate, rebuilding ATP.
