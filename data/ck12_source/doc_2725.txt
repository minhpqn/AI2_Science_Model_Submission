Carbon nanotubes are made in labs, but carbon-based compounds are also the most common naturally occurring compounds on Earth.
More than 90 percent of all known compounds contain carbon.
Do you know why carbon is found in so many compounds?

Carbon, Carbon Everywhere
Carbon is a very common “ingredient” of matter because it can combine with itself and with many other elements.
It can form a great diversity of compounds, ranging in size from just a few atoms to thousands of atoms.
There are millions of known carbon compounds, and carbon is the only element that can form so many different compounds.

Valence Electrons in Carbon
Carbon is a nonmetal in group 14 of the periodic table.
Like other group 14 elements, carbon has four valence electrons.
Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in chemical bonds.
The valence electrons of carbon are shown in the electron dot diagram in the Figure below .
Valence shell of carbon
Q:
How many more electrons does carbon need to have a full outer energy level?
A:
Carbon needs four more valence electrons, or a total of eight valence electrons, to fill its outer energy level.
