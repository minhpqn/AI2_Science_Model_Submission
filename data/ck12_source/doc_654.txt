The combined gas law, PV \propto T , is true for a particular sample of gas.
If any gas is added or allowed to leak out, however, the relationship is lost.
In order to get a relationship that is true for any sample of gas, it is necessary to incorporate a term for the amount of gas.
From observations as simple as blowing up a balloon, it is clear that increasing the amount of gas increases the volume.
Because different gases have different weights per molecule, including a term for mass of gas does not produce a consistent equation.
If, however, we include a term expressing the number of moles of gas rather than its mass, we can produce a constant proportionality.
A mole is a unit representing the number of atoms present.
The letter  n is used to represent the moles of substance.
Incorporating  n into the equation yields  PV \propto nT .
If we insert a letter, R , to represent the constant of proportionality, we get the normal form of the universal gas law , PV = nRT .
The unit term for  n is always moles and T is always in Kelvin.
The units for pressure and volume, however, may vary.
The value of  R depends on the units that are used for pressure and volume.

Since the product of (liters)(atm) can be converted to joules, we also have a value for  R where liters Ã— atm have been converted to joules, R = 8.314 \ \text{J/mol} \cdot \text{K} .  The two common values of the universal gas law constant R are 0.0821 \ \text{L} \cdot \text{atm/mol} \cdot \text{K} and 8.314 \ \text{J/mol} \cdot \text{K} .
Most universal gas law problems are calculated at STP.
STP stands for standard temperature and pressure,  which is the most commonly calculated temperature and pressure value.
