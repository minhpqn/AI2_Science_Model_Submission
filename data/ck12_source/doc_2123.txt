How would you find ores?
There are many steps to finding an ore deposit.
Find a place with likely geology.
Test the soil and rock for the ore mineral or others that are often found with the ore mineral.
Drill to test deeper rock and soil.
Then make a map and do the calculations.
If the deposit is found to be profitable, you can begin mining.
When you use a roll of aluminum foil or some baby powder, you probably donâ€™t think about how the products were made.
You may not even know that those products are from minerals!
We use minerals in many everyday items.
Minerals have to be located, removed from the ground, and refined before they can be made into the products.
A rock that contains important minerals is called an ore .
The concentration of valuable minerals in an ore may be high or low.
Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores.
Geologists search for the places that might have ore deposits.
For example, if you want copper, you need to look at regions with a particular geology.
Copper is often found where hot fluids came off of a magma intrusion.
Aluminum is found in intensely weathered soils in tropical areas.
Some of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground.
Some may be at the surface.
