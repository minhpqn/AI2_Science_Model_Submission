This is called precycling .
Pop cans and plastic water bottles, for example, are fairly easy to recycle.
Some types of packaging are harder to recycle ( Figure below ).
If it can’t be reused or recycled, it’s a waste of resources.
Many plastics:
The recycling symbol on the bottom of plastic containers shows the type of plastic they contain.
Numbers 1 and 2 are easier to recycle than higher numbers.
Mixed materials:
Packaging that contains more than one material may be hard to recycle.
This carton is made mostly of cardboard.
But it has plastic around the opening.
Plastic bottles and milk cartons are hard to recycle
These types of packaging are hard to recycle.
Could you reuse any of them?
Reusing resources means using items again instead of throwing them away.
A reused item can be used in the same way by someone else.
Or it can be used in a new way.
For example, Shana has a pair of jeans she has outgrown.
She might give them to her younger sister to wear.
Or she might use them to make something different for herself, say, a denim shoulder bag.
