Thus, positive charges go 'downhill' and negative charges go 'uphill'.
You have a negative charge of unknown value and a positive charge of magnitude q_1 and mass m .
After fixing the negative charge in place, you place the positive charge a distance r_i away from the negative charge and then release it.
If the speed of the positive charge when it is a distance r_f away from the negative charge is v , what was the magnitude of the negative charge in terms of the given values?
There are multiple ways to do this problem, we will solve it using conservation of energy and the change in voltage to determine the magnitude of the negative charge.
When working through this problem, we'll call the positive charge q_1 and the negative charge q_2 .
To start we'll say that the charge had zero potential energy when it was .5m from the negative charge; this will help us as we work through the problem.
Using this assertion, we will apply conservation of energy to the positive charge.
\Delta U_e&=KE_f && \text{start with conservation of energy}\\\q_1\Delta V&=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 && \text{substitute the equations for each energy term}\\\\Delta V&=\frac{mv^2}{2q_1} && \text{solve for V}\\\
Now, since we know the voltage difference, we will express it using the equation for voltage at a certain distance from a point charge.
\Delta V&=\frac{kq_2}{\Delta r} && \text{start with the equation for voltage at a certain distance}\\\\Delta V&=\frac{kq_2}{r_f}-\frac{kq_2}{r_i} && \text{express the change in radius in terms of the initial and final radius of the positive charge}\\\\Delta V&=kq_2(\frac{1}{r_f}-\frac{1}{r_i}) && \text{factor the equation}\\\\frac{mv^2}{2q_1}&=kq_2(\frac{1}{r_f}-\frac{1}{r_i}) && \text{substitute in the value from the first step}\\\q_2&=\frac{mv^2}{2q_1k(\frac{1}{r_f}-\frac{1}{r_i})} && \text{solve for }q_2\\\
