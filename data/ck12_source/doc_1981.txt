Human population increased dramatically at certain times.
The graph begins 10,000 BC, although you can't really see the line.
Population starts to rise perceptibly at around 1800 BC.
The numbers begin to rise dramatically about 200 years ago.
What causes these changes?
Farming was developed about 10,000 years ago.
Farming meant a steady supply of food.
People could settle in villages.
The rise at around 1800 BC is due to increased farming and the rise of cities and towns.

What happened?
The Industrial Revolution is what happened.
The Industrial Revolution began in the late 1700s in Europe, North America, and a few other places.
Before the Industrial Revolution, most labor was done by people.
The Industrial Revolution changed the source of power from humans to fossil fuels.
