A snowflake is made of ice, or water in the solid state.
A solid is one of four well-known states of matter.
The other three states are liquid, gas, and plasma.
Compared with these other states of matter, solids have particles that are much more tightly packed together.
The particles are held rigidly in place by all the other particles around them so they can’t slip past one another or move apart.
This gives solids a fixed shape and a fixed volume.
Types of Solids
Not all solids are alike.
Some are crystalline solids; others are amorphous solids.
Snowflakes are crystalline solids.
Particles of crystalline solids are arranged in a regular repeating pattern, as you can see in the sketch in Figure below .
The repeating particles form a geometric shape called a crystal.
You can watch a snowflake crystal forming at the following URL:
Another crystalline solid is table salt (sodium chloride).
Crystals of table salt are pictured in the Figure below .
Table salt is a crystalline solid
Amorphous means “shapeless.” Particles of amorphous solids are arranged more-or-less at random and do not form crystals, as you can see in the Figure below .
An example of an amorphous solid is cotton candy, also shown in the Figure below .
