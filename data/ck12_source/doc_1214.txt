Explain how sediments become rock.
Distinguish clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks.
What steps led to this rock formation?
What do you see?
The rock is a sandstone, so first there were rocks that weathered and eroded.
The cross-bedding indicates that the sand was deposited in a dune.
The sand was then buried deeply enough that it turned into rock.
This concept will explore how something like sand could become a rock.
Sedimentary Rock Formation
There are two main types of sedimentary rocks: clastic and chemical.
Clastic rocks are made of sediments, which are sometimes called clasts.
Creating rocks from sediments is called lithification .
Chemicals precipitate from liquid to form chemical sedimentary rocks.
Over time, deposited sediments may harden into rock.
First, the sediments are compacted .
That is, they are squeezed together by the weight of sediments on top of them.
Next, the sediments are cemented together.
Minerals fill in the spaces between the loose sediment particles.
These cementing minerals come from the water that moves through the sediments.
Sedimentary rocks that form from sediments are called “clastic rocks.“ Clastic rocks are rock fragments that are compacted and cemented together ( Figure below ).
