They are having a discussion.
As you can see, the girl is rolling her eyes.
What do you think her parents may have said that caused this reaction?
Could it be they have just grounded her for some reason?
That’s certainly one possibility, but without any other information to go on, it’s “just a theory.” In other words, it’s just a hunch or a guess.
Theories are very important in science, but in science a theory is never a hunch or a guess.
It is much more than that.
Not “Just a Theory”
The term theory is used differently in science than it is used in everyday language.
A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence.
Because it is so well supported, a scientific theory has a very good chance of being a correct explanation for events in nature.
Because it is a broad explanation, it can explain many observations and pieces of evidence.
In other words, it can help connect and make sense of many phenomena in the natural world.
Examples of Theories in Physical Science
A number of theories in science were first proposed many decades or even centuries ago, but they have withstood the test of time.
An example of a physical science theory that has mainly withstood the test of time is Dalton’s atomic theory.
John Dalton was a British chemist who lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s.
Around 1800, he published his atomic theory, which is one of the most important theories in science.
According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all substances consist of tiny particles called atoms.
Furthermore, all the atoms of a given element are identical, whereas the atoms of different elements are always different.
