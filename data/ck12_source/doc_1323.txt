This is because liquids and gases don’t resist changing shape.
P-waves and S-waves are the two types of body waves
P-waves and S-waves are the two types of body waves.
Love waves and Rayleigh waves are the two types of surface waves
Love waves and Rayleigh waves are the two types of surface waves.
Surface waves travel along the ground outward from an earthquake’s epicenter.
Surface waves are the slowest of all seismic waves.
They travel at 2.5 km (1.5 miles) per second.
There are two types of surface waves.
Love waves move side-to-side, much like a snake.
Rayleigh waves produce a rolling motion as they move up and backward ( Figure above ).
Surface waves cause objects to fall and rise.
They also cause objects to sway back and forth.
These motions cause damage to rigid structures during an earthquake.
Body waves travel through the body of a planet.
Surface waves travel along the surface.
There are two types of body waves:
P-waves travel fastest and through solids, liquids, and gases;
S-waves only travel through solids.
Surface waves are the slowest, but they do the most damage in an earthquake.
