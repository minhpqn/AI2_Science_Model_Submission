How has reducing acid rain helped the environment?
How much have toxic emissions from industry been reduced?
What categories of technologies have improved air quality?
Why is the Clean Air Act important?
Why is it important to develop alternative energy sources?
What can you do to reduce the amount of air pollution you produce?
The layers of the atmosphere are divided by their temperature gradients.
The lowest layer is the troposphere.
All weather takes place in this layer.
The next layer is the stratosphere.
The stratosphere contains the protective ozone layer.
More sunlight strikes at the Equator than at the poles.
This is what drives the global winds.
Warm air rises, moves poleward, and then sinks when it meets with air moving toward the Equator.
The result is six atmospheric circulation cells around the world.
There are three cells in each hemisphere.
Pollutants enter the atmosphere from a few sources.
The most important is fossil fuel burning.
Air pollution has bad effects on the environment and on human health.
By reducing fossil fuel use we can make the environment cleaner.
