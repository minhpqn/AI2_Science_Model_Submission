Outline how an electric motor changes electrical energy to kinetic energy.
The little boy on the left is pressing the doorbell on his playhouse.
The doorbell is connected to a battery, so it actually rings when he pushes the button.
The little girl on the right is using a hand-held fan to cool off on a hot day.
The fan is also battery-operated, and the blades of the fan turn in a blur of motion.
What do the doorbell and fan have in common?
Both of them work because they contain electromagnets.
Devices with Electromagnets
Many common electric devices contain electromagnets.
An electromagnet is a coil of wire wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material.
When electric current flows through the wire, it causes the coil and iron bar to become magnetized.
An electromagnet has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field.
Turning off the current turns off the electromagnet.
To understand how electromagnets are used in electric devices, weâ€™ll focus on two common devices: doorbells and electric motors like the one that turns the blades of a fan.
Q:
Besides doorbells and fans, what are some other devices that contain electromagnets?
A:
Any device that has an electric motor contains electromagnets.
Some other examples include hairdryers, CD players, power drills, electric saws, and electric mixers.
