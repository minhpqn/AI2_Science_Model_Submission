What is the heat of reaction?
What units are used?
During the experimental measurement of heat of reaction, is heat lost to the surroundings or gained from the surroundings?
What is enthalpy?
What is an extensive property?
Do the states of reactants and products influence enthalpy values?
enthalpy (H) :
The heat content of a system at constant pressure.
Perform calculations involving calorimetry relationships.
The amount of calories contained in food can be measured using a bomb calorimeter
How many calories are in your food?
At one time, calories in foods were measured with a bomb calorimeter (see figure above).
A weighed amount of the food would be placed in the calorimeter and the system was then sealed and filled with oxygen.
An electric spark ignited the food-oxygen mixture.
The amount of heat released when the food burned would give an idea of the food calories present.
Today calories are calculated from the protein, carbohydrate, and fat content of the food (all determined by chemical analysis).
No more bombs needed.
Calorimetry is the measurement of the transfer of heat into or out of a system during a chemical reaction or physical process.
A calorimeter is an insulated container that is used to measure heat changes.
The majority of reactions that can be analyzed in a calorimetry experiment are either liquids or aqueous solutions.
