Terrestrial organisms are generally limited by temperature and moisture.
Therefore, terrestrial biomes are defined in terms of these abiotic factors.
Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of temperature or moisture.
Instead, their main limiting factors are the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water.
These factors vary from place to place in a body of water and are used to define aquatic biomes .
Aquatic Biomes and Sunlight
In large bodies of standing water, including the ocean and lakes, the water can be divided into zones based on the amount of sunlight it receives:
The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters (656 feet) below the surface of the water.
This is where enough sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur.
Algae and other photosynthetic organisms can make food and support food webs.
The aphotic zone is water deeper than 200 meters.
This is where too little sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur.
As a result, food must be made by chemosynthesis or else drift down from the water above.
These and other aquatic zones in the ocean are identified in Figure below .
Different aquatic zones are identified in this diagram of the ocean
The ocean is divided into many different zones, depending on distance from shore and depth of water.
Aquatic Biomes and Dissolved Substances
Water in lakes and the ocean also varies in the amount of dissolved oxygen and nutrients it contains:
Water near the surface of lakes and the ocean usually has more dissolved oxygen than does deeper water.
This is because surface water absorbs oxygen from the air above it.
