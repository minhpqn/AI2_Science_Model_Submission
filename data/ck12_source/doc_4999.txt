The exothermic reaction on the left releases energy.
The endothermic reaction on the right consumes energy.
Chemical reactions follow the laws of thermodynamics.
The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed.
This law is also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics states the energy available after a chemical reaction is always less than that at the beginning of a reaction.
This is also commonly referred to as entropy.
Entropy can be described as the degree of disorder in a system .
That is, as energy is transferred from one form to another, some of the energy is lost as heat, and the amount of available energy decreases.
As the energy decreases, the disorder in the system increases, and, by definition, the entropy increases.
Ice melting provides an example in which entropy increases.
Entropy essentially is a measure of the tendency of a process, such as a chemical reaction, to proceed in a particular direction.
Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic or exothermic, that is if they release energy.
The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy and entropy.
Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a thermodynamic system.
The change in enthalpy is positive in endothermic reactions, and negative in exothermic processes.
Chemical reactions that release energy are called exothermic reactions .
An example is the combustion of methane described at the beginning of this lesson.
In organisms, exothermic reactions are called catabolic reactions .
