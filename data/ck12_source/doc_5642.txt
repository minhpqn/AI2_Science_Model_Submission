Lightning is extremely dangerous.
A single bolt of lightning can carry a billion volts of electricity.
That’s enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb—for three months!
As impressive as it is, lightning is nothing more than a sudden flow of extremely tiny particles.
What are the particles that flow in a lightning bolt?
The answer is electrons.
What Are Electrons?
Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up atoms.
The other two types are protons and neutrons.
Unlike protons and neutrons, which consist of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are fundamental particles that do not consist of smaller particles.
They are a type of fundamental particles called leptons.
All leptons have an electric charge of -1 or 0.

Properties of Electrons
Electrons are extremely small.
The mass of an electron is only about 1/2000 the mass of a proton or neutron, so electrons contribute virtually nothing to the total mass of an atom.
Electrons have an electric charge of -1, which is equal but opposite to the charge of proton, which is +1.
All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, so the positive and negative charges “cancel out,” making atoms electrically neutral.
