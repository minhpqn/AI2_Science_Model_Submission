Mercury also has virtually no atmosphere.
As the planet rotates very slowly, the temperature varies tremendously.
In direct sunlight, the surface can be as hot as 427°C (801°F).
On the dark side, the surface can be as cold as –183°C (–297°F)!
The coldest temperatures may be on the insides of craters.
Most of Mercury is extremely dry.
Scientists think that there may be a small amount of water, in the form of ice, at the planet's poles.
The poles never receive direct sunlight.
A Liquid Metal Core
Pictured below is a diagram of Mercury's interior ( Figure below ).
Mercury is one of the densest planets.
Scientists think that the interior contains a large core made mostly of melted iron.
The inner core may be solid.
Mercury's core takes up about 85% of the planet's radius.
Mercury is one of the most dense planets, with a very large core
Mercury is one of the most dense planets, with a very large core.
Mercury appears to be moving rapidly because it's so close to the Sun.
Mercury has short years, just 88 Earth days.
Mercury has long days, about 57 Earth days.
Mercury is extremely hot and has a liquid metal core.
