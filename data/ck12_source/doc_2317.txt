We depend on physical science for just about everything that makes modern life possible.
You couldnâ€™t turn on a light, make a phone call, or use a computer without centuries of discoveries in chemistry and physics.
The Figure below show a variety of other ways that people depend on physical science.
Think about how knowledge of energy and matter makes each action possible.
