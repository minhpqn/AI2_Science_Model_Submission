Along the phospholipid bilayer, numerous proteins are embedded within the membrane.
This structure is called the Fluid Mosaic Model which will be discussed in the The Plasma Membrane:
The Fluid Mosaic Model (Advanced) concept.
These proteins have a variety of important roles; hormone binding sites, electron carriers, pumps for active transport, channels for passive transport, enzymes, cell signaling and cell adhesion.
The plasma membranes allows only certain molecules, such as ions and small organic molecules, into and out of the cell.
The ability to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as selective permeability or semipermeability .
This characteristic helps the cell to regulate its interactions between the internal machinery and the external surroundings, helping to maintain homeostasis.
The plasma membrane also acts as the attachment point for both the intracellular cytoskeleton and, if present, the cell wall.
The plasma membrane is discussed at .

cell membrane :
Thin coat of lipids (phospholipids) that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment; also called the plasma membrane.
Fluid Mosaic Model :
Model of the plasma membrane; proposes that the membrane behaves like a fluid with an embedded mosaic of proteins.
phospholipid bilayer :
A bilayer (2 layers) of phospholipids that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment.
