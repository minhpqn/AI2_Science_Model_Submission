See DNA and proteins are key molecules of the cell nucleus at for a description of early work (starting in 1869) on DNA and proteins.
Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ):
Energy-carrying molecule that cells use to power their metabolic processes; energy-currency of the cell.
codon :
A sequence of three nucleotides within mRNA; encodes for a specific amino acid or termination (stop) sequence.
complementary bases :
A pair of nucleotide bases that bond togetherâ€”either adenine and thymine (or uracil) or cytosine and guanine; complementary base pair.
deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ):
Double-stranded nucleic acid that composes genes and chromosomes; the hereditary material.
double helix :
The double spiral shape of the DNA molecule; resembles a spiral staircase.
genetic code :
The universal code of three-base codons; encodes the genetic instructions for the amino acid sequence of proteins.
nucleic acid : organic compound such as DNA or RNA
nucleotide :
Monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar, and a phosphate group.
ribonucleic acid ( RNA ):
Single-stranded nucleic acid; involved in protein synthesis.
Nucleic acids are organic compounds that consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
DNA, RNA and ATP are important nucleic acids.
