How this happens depends on whether the cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
Cell division is simpler in prokaryotes than eukaryotes because prokaryotic cells themselves are simpler.
Prokaryotic cells have a single circular chromosome, no nucleus, and few other organelles.
Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have multiple chromosomes contained within a nucleus, and many other organelles.
All of these cell parts must be duplicated and then separated when the cell divides.
A chromosome is a molecule of DNA, and will be the focus of a subsequent concept.
Cell Division in Prokaryotes
Most prokaryotic cells divide by the process of binary fission .
A bacterial cell dividing this way is depicted in Figure below .
You can also watch an animation of binary fission at this link:
Binary fission of bacteria
Binary Fission in a Bacterial Cell.
Cell division is relatively simple in prokaryotic cells.
The two cells are dividing by binary fission.
Green and orange lines indicate old and newly-generated bacterial cell walls, respectively.
Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical daughter cells.
Left, growth at the center of bacterial body.
Right, apical growth from the ends of the bacterial body.
Binary fission can be described as a series of steps, although it is actually a continuous process.
The steps are described below and also illustrated in Figure below .
