When Things Go Awry
On Wednesday, March 28, 1979, the residents of Middleton, PA woke up to a very scary situation.
A nuclear power plant near the town had experienced a series of malfunctions that led to the release of some radioactive gases into the atmosphere, along with a partial meltdown of the reactor core.
Fortunately, follow-up studies have shown that there were no health effects on workers or the general public.
A thorough investigation was conducted that led to significant improvements in safety and operations of these power plants.
One of the two reactors was shut down completely, but the other one is still in operation and will be permanently deactivated in 2014.
Nuclear Power Generation
The generation of electricity is critical for operation of businesses, health care delivery, schools, homes, and other areas requiring the use of electrical power.
According to 2011 statistics, coal is used for 42% of the total power generated, with natural gas being employed for another 25%.
Nuclear power plants are employed in about 19% of the cases, with renewable energy sources supplying the last 13%.
All of these fuels are used to heat water to generate steam.
The steam then turns a turbine to generate electricity.
The diagram below shows the layout of a typical nuclear power plant.
The radioactive rods are in the red container along with water, which is heated to steam.
The energy for this heat comes from fission reactions of uranium.
The steam passes through the turbine and causes the turbine to spin, generating electricity.
As the steam condenses, it is run through a cooling tower to lower its temperature.
The water then recirculates through the reactor core to be used again.
