Many would consider the moat around this castle, together with the thick stone castle walls, as the first line of defense.
Their role is to keep the enemy out, and protect what's inside.
The First Line of Defense
Does this organism look like a space alien?
A scary creature from a nightmare?
In fact, it’s a 1-cm long worm that lives in the human body and causes serious harm.
It enters the body through a hair follicle of the skin when it’s in a much smaller stage of its life cycle.
Like this worm, many other organisms can make us sick if they manage to enter our body.
Fortunately for us, our immune system is able to keep out most such invaders.
The immune system protects the body from worms, germs, and other agents of harm.
The immune system is like a medieval castle.
The outside of the castle was protected by a moat and high stone walls.
Inside the castle, soldiers were ready to fight off any invaders that managed to get through the outer defenses.
Like a medieval castle, the immune system has a series of defenses.
