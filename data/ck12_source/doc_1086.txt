Scales indicate horizontal distance and are also found on the map legend.
Interpreting Contour Maps
How does a topographic map tell you about the terrain?
Letâ€™s consider the following principles:
The spacing of contour lines shows the slope of the land .
Contour lines that are close together indicate a steep slope.
This is because the elevation changes quickly in a small area.
Contour lines that seem to touch indicate a very steep slope, like a cliff.
When contour lines are spaced far apart, the slope is gentle.
So contour lines help us see the three-dimensional shape of the land.
Look at the topographic map of Stowe, Vermont ( Figure below ).
There is a steep hill rising just to the right of the city of Stowe.
You can tell this because the contour lines there are closely spaced.
The contour lines also show that the hill has a sharp rise of about 200 feet.
Then the slope becomes less steep toward the right.
Closely spaced contour lines on a topographic map indicate a steep slope

When contour lines form closed loops, there is a hill.
