On the other end of the spectrum, the solubility of zinc hydroxide is only 4.2 × 10 -4  g/L of water at the same temperature.
Many ionic compounds containing hydroxide are relatively insoluble.
Most ionic compounds that are considered to be insoluble will still dissolve to a small extent in water.
These “mostly insoluble” compounds are considered to be strong electrolytes because whatever portion of the compound that dissolved also dissociates.
As an example, silver chloride dissociates to a small extent into silver ions and chloride ions upon being added to water.
\text{AgCl}(s) \rightleftarrows \text{Ag}^+(aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq)
The process is written as an equilibrium because the dissociation occurs only to a small extent.
Therefore, an equilibrium expression can be written for the process.
Keep in mind that the solid silver chloride does not have a variable concentration and so is not included in the expression.
This equilibrium constant is called the solubility product constant , (K_{sp}) and is equal to the mathematical product of the ions each raised to the power of the coefficient of the ion in the dissociation equation.
The stoichiometry of the formula of the ionic compound dictates the form of the  K_{sp} expression.
For example the formula of calcium phosphate is Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 .
The dissociation equation and  K_{sp} expression are shown below:
\text{Ca}_3(\text{PO}_4)_2(s) \rightleftarrows 3\text{Ca}^{2+}(aq)+2\text{PO}^{3-}_4(aq) \quad K_{sp}=[\text{Ca}^{2+}]^3[\text{PO}^{3-}_4]^2
The Table below lists solubility product constants for some common nearly insoluble ionic compounds.
