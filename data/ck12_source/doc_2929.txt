Why?
Individual 5 does not have Whirling disorder, but what colored pieces does it have that potentially could have carried the gene for Whirling Disorder?
From whom did he inherit these pieces.
Which puzzle piece (gene) is responsible for Whirling Disorder?
What is a pedigree?
How might a pedigree aid a scientist?
Describe the genetics of Down syndrome.
Explain how changes in chromosomes can cause disorders in humans.
Can you have too many chromosomes?
Yes, it's not a good thing to have extra chromosomes.
An extra chromosome can be fatal to an embryo, in fact.
In the case of a few chromosomes, however, a baby may be born with an extra chromosome.
This child will have a chromosomal disorder.
Some children are born with genetic defects that are not carried by a single gene.
Instead, an error in a larger part of the chromosome or even in an entire chromosome causes the disorder.
Usually the error happens when the egg or sperm is forming.
Having extra chromosomes or damaged chromosomes can cause disorders.
One common example of an extra-chromosome disorder is Down syndrome ( Figure below ).
Children with Down syndrome are mentally disabled and also have physical deformities.
Down syndrome occurs when a baby receives an extra chromosome 21 from one of his or her parents.
