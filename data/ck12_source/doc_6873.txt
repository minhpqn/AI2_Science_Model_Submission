Some larvae also have chewing mouthparts, as in the caterpillar stages of moths and butterflies ( Figure below ).

Some insects use siphoning, as if sucking through a straw, like moths and butterflies.
This long mouth-tube that they use to suck up the nectar of the flower is called a proboscis .
Some moths, however, have no mouthparts at all.
Some insects obtain food by sponging , like the housefly.
Sponging means that the mouthpart can absorb liquid food and send it to the esophagus.
The housefly is able to eat solid food by releasing saliva and dabbing it over the food.
As the saliva dissolves the food, the sponging mouthpart absorbs the liquid food.
