For many single-celled organisms, reproduction is a similar process.
The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent.
In many other organisms, two parents are involved, and the offspring are not identical to the parents.
In fact, each offspring is unique.
Look at the family in Figure below .
The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them.
Instead, each has a unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents.
A family portrait shows children resemble their parents but are not identical to them

Mother, Daughter, Father, and Son.
Children resemble their parents, but they are never identical to them.
Do you know why this is the case?
Reproduction is the process by which organisms give rise to offspring.
It is one of the defining characteristics of living things.
There are two basic types of reproduction: asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Asexual reproduction involves a single parent.
It results in offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent.
All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way.
There are several different methods of asexual reproduction.
They include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding.
