A change of color occurs during the reaction.
A gas is produced during the reaction.
A solid product called a precipitate is produced in the reaction.
A transfer of energy occurs as a result of the reaction.
Mercury(II) oxide is a red solid.
When it is heated to a temperature above 500Â°C, it easily decomposes into mercury and oxygen gas.
The red color of the mercury oxide reactant becomes the silver color of mercury.
The color change is the sign that the reaction is occurring.
A bottle of mercuric oxide
Drop of liquid mercury
When zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, the reaction bubbles vigorously as hydrogen gas is produced.
The production of a gas is also an indication that a chemical reaction is occurring.
Zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid to form hydrogen gas
Zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid produces bubbles of hydrogen gas.
When a colorless solution of lead(II) nitrate is added to a colorless solution of potassium iodide, a yellow solid called a precipitate is instantly produced.
A precipitate is a solid product that forms from a reaction and settles out of a liquid mixture.
The formation of a precipitate is an indication of a chemical reaction.
Lead nitrate and potassium iodide react to form lead iodide
A yellow precipitate of solid lead(II) iodide forms immediately when solutions of lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide are mixed.
All chemical changes involve a transfer of energy.
