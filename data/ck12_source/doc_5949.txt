mass = 2.81 g
mol Cu(OH) 2
One conversion factor will allow us to convert from mass to moles.
Step 2:
Calculate.
First, it is necessary to calculate the molar mass of Cu(OH) 2 from the molar masses of Cu, O, and H.  The molar mass is 97.57 g/mol.
2.81 \ \text{g} \ \text{Cu(OH)}_2 \times \frac{1 \ \ \text{mol} \ \text{Cu(OH)}_2}{97.57 \ \text{g} \ \text{Cu(OH)}_2}=0.0288 \ \text{mol} \ \text{Cu(OH)}_2
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The relatively small mass of product formed results in a small number of moles.
Calculations involving conversions between moles of a material and the mass of that material are described.
Read the material in the link below and work the problems at the end.
Why would you want to calculate the mass of a material?
Why would you want to determine how many moles of material you produced in a reaction?
You have 19.7 grams of a material and wonder how many moles were formed.
Your friend tells you to multiply the mass by grams/mole.
Is your friend correct?
