Prokaryotic Cell Division - Advanced
Describe the properties of cell division in prokaryotes.
How do bacteria reproduce?
Essentially, after replicating their DNA, they just grow and divide.
As shown here, they grow larger and then split into two separate but genetically identical cells.
Cell Division in Prokaryotes
Prokaryotic organisms reproduce asexually by binary fission , a process that produces identical offspring ( Figure below ).
In asexual reproduction , a single parent produces genetically identical offspring.
As prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, and have only one circular chromosome, they do not need to reproduce by the same mechanism as eukaryotic cells; mitosis does not exist in prokaryotic cells .
