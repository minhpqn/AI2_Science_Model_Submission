Different enzymes work on different types of stains, such as grease stains or bloodstains.
Removing stains isn’t the only use of enzymes.
Enzymes are also essential to life.
Why Living Things Need Enzymes
Chemical reactions constantly occur inside the cells of living things.
However, under the conditions inside cells, most biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to maintain life.
That’s where enzymes come in.
Enzymes are catalysts in living things.
Like other catalysts, they speed up chemical reactions.
Enzymes are proteins that are synthesized in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded in the cells’ DNA.
How Enzymes Work
Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting.
One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below .
Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again.
Each enzyme is highly specific for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective.
A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme.
Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form.
The lock and key model illustrates how many enzymes function
Q:
This model of enzyme action is called the lock-and-key model.
