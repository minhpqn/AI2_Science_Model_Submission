6. 40 coins
b. upward c. 4.5 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 d.
Cooler air outside, so more initial buoyant force e.
Thin air at high altitudes weighs almost nothing, so little weight displaced.

The bottom of the cup is 3 \;\mathrm{cm} in radius
b. 500,000 \;\mathrm{N}
a. 10 \;\mathrm{N} b. 10.5 \;\mathrm{N} c. 11 \;\mathrm{N} d. 11 \;\mathrm{N}
Pressure in Fluids
Define pressure and solve pressure problems in the context of fluids.
Students will learn about pressure and solving pressure problems in the context of fluids.
P = \frac{F}{A} && \text{Pressure is force per unit area}\\P = P_o - \rho gh && \text{Pressure in an incompressible fluid as a function of depth}\\
The pressure of a fluid is a measure of the forces exerted by a large number of molecules when they collide and bounce off its boundary.
The unit of pressure is the Pascal (Pa).
In a fluid at rest, pressure increases linearly with depth â€“ this is due to the weight of the water above it.
