The probabilities of earthquakes striking along various faults in the San Francisco area between 2003 (when the work was done) and 2032.
When an earthquake will occur is much more difficult to predict.
Stress on a fault builds up at the same rate over time.
So earthquakes should occur at regular intervals.
But, so far, scientists cannot predict when quakes will occur even to within a few years.
Around Parkfield, California, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or higher occurs about every 22 years.
So seismologists predicted that one would strike in 1993.
But that quake came in 2004â€”11 years late ( Figure below ).

Trying to predict an earthquake in Parkfield, California.
There are sometimes signs that a large earthquake is coming.
There may be small quakes, called foreshocks .
These can occur a few seconds to a few weeks before a major quake.
Unfortunately, foreshocks are not very useful for predicting large earthquakes.
Many quakes do not have foreshocks.
Also, small earthquakes are not necessarily followed by a large earthquake.
There are other possible signs before an earthquake.
The ground may tilt.
Ground tilting is caused by the buildup of stress in the rocks.
This may happen before a large earthquake, but it doesn't always.
