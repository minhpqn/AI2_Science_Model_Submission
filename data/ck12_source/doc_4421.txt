The placenta sustains the fetus while it grows inside the mother’s uterus.
Placental mammals give birth to relatively large and mature infants.
Most mammals are placental mammals.
The placenta is a spongy structure.
It consists of membranes and blood vessels from both mother and embryo (see Figure below ).
The placenta passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus.
It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother.
The placenta lets blood from the fetus and mother exchange substances without actually mixing.
Thus, it protects the fetus from being attacked by the mother’s immune system as a “foreign parasite.”

The placenta allows the exchange of gases, nutrients, and other substances between the fetus and mother.
Pros and Cons of Placental Reproduction
The placenta permits a long period of fetal growth in the uterus.
As a result, the fetus can become large and mature before birth.
This increases its chances of surviving.
On the other hand, supporting a growing fetus is very draining and risky for the mother.
The mother has to eat more food to nourish the fetus.
She also becomes heavier and less mobile as the fetus gets larger.
As a result, she may be less able to escape from predators.
Because the fetus is inside her, she can’t abandon it to save her own life if she is pursued or if food is scarce.
