Vitamin C is the independent variable.
Why should an experiment manipulate only one variable?
Imagine a woman who eats a diet heavy on junk food.
She is low on energy and says she just doesn't feel right.
She decides to change her diet.
She cuts out dairy products, wheat, meat and refined sugar.
She also cuts out junk food.
She feels better!
She insists that the cause of her new well-being is the lack of dairy, wheat, meat, and sugar.
But it's also possible that she feels better because she eliminated junk food.
In other words, she doesn't know what made her feel better.
Is it possible that it was eliminating junk food that made her feel better?
Is it possible it was eliminating wheat?
Meat?
Maybe she's lactose intolerant and it was milk.
Of course, it could have been any of those things.
She doesn't know what it is that made her feel better because she changed too many variables.
How could she be more scientific about understanding exactly what it was in her diet that was making her feel bad?
Scientists make many measurements during experiments.
Humans and equipment can make mistakes.
