How does the genetic code in the DNA get passed on to the mRNA?
What will be the mRNA sequence transcribed from a TTAAACGGCCTA template?
Translation of RNA to Protein
Explain the relationship between the tRNA, anticodon, codon, and mRNA.
Describe the process of translation.
Explain the role of the genetic code.
How does the cell translate a message?
The mRNA is the message sent from the nucleus to the ribosome, the organelle of protein synthesis.
Like a foreign language, the genetic code of the mRNA message must then be translated so that the ribosomes make the correct protein.
The process of reading the code of a mRNA to make a protein is called translation.
The mRNA, which is transcribed from the DNA in the nucleus, carries the directions for the protein-making process. mRNA tells the ribosome ( Figure below ) how to create a specific protein.
Ribosomes translate mRNA into a protein
Ribosomes translate RNA into a protein with a specific amino acid sequence.
The tRNA binds and brings to the ribosome the amino acid encoded by the mRNA.
The process of reading the mRNA code in the ribosome to make a protein is called translation ( Figure below ): the mRNA is translated from the language of nucleic acids (nucleotides) to the language of proteins (amino acids).
Sets of three bases, called codons , are read in the ribosome, the organelle responsible for making proteins.
DNA is transcribed to mRNA, which is translated into a protein
This summary of how genes are expressed shows that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is translated, in turn, to protein.
The one letter code represents amino acids.
The following are the steps involved in translation:
