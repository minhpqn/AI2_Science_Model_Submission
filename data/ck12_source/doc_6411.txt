Notice that the conjugate base of a weak acid is also a strong base.
For example, the acetate ion has a small tendency to accept a hydrogen ion from water to form acetic acid and the hydroxide ion.
Strong and weak bases are defined.
The base equilibrium constant is stated.
Read the material at the link below and answer the following questions:
In the presence of hydroxide ions, which way does the equilibrium shift for the equation showing the dissociation of water?
What percentage of ammonia in solution actually produces hydroxide ions?
How does the position of equilibrium relate to the strength of a weak base?
Define a strong base.
Define a weak base.
Which is the stronger base: pyridine or urea?
base ionization constant (K_b) :
The equilibrium constant for the ionization of a base.
strong base:
A base which ionizes completely in aqueous solution.
weak base:
A base that ionizes only slightly in aqueous solution.
