So what exactly is a seed?
Seed Plants Emerge
For reproduction, early vascular plants still needed moisture.
Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization.
Spores also needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well.
Of course, dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for tiny new offspring plants to survive.
With the evolution of seeds in vascular plants, all that changed.
Seed plants evolved a number of adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water.
As a result, seed plants were wildly successful.
They exploded into virtually all of Earth’s habitats.
Why are seeds so adaptive on land?
A seed contains an embryo and a food supply enclosed within a tough coating.
An embryo is a zygote that has already started to develop and grow.
Early growth and development of a plant embryo in a seed is called germination .
The seed protects and nourishes the embryo and gives it a huge head start in the “race” of life.
Many seeds can wait to germinate until conditions are favorable for growth.
This increases the offspring’s chance of surviving even more.
Other reproductive adaptations that evolved in seed plants include ovules, pollen, pollen tubes, and pollination by animals.
An ovule is a female reproductive structure in seed plants that contains a tiny female gametophyte.
The gametophyte produces an egg cell.
