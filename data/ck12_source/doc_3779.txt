Give an overview of life during the six periods of the Paleozoic Era.
What was early life like?
Prehistoric underwater life exploded with amazing new creatures during the Paleozoic Era.
Evolution allowed life to take many diverse forms, eventually developing the necessary adaptations to move from the ocean onto land.
Life During the Paleozoic
The Paleozoic Era is literally the era of “old life.” It lasted from 544 to 245 million years ago and is divided into six periods.
Major events in each period of the Paleozoic Era are described in Figure below .
The era began with a spectacular burst of new life.
This is called the Cambrian explosion.
The era ended with the biggest mass extinction the world had ever seen.
This is known as the Permian extinction.

The Paleozoic Era includes the six periods described here.

The Cambrian Period :
Following the Precambrian mass extinction, there was an explosion of new kinds of organisms in the Cambrian Period (544–505 million years ago).
Many types of primitive animals called sponges evolved.
Small ocean invertebrates called trilobites became abundant.
