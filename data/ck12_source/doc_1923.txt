The leading hypothesis for how they formed is called the nebular hypothesis .
The Solar Nebula
The Sun and planets formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust.
This was the solar nebula .
The cloud contracted and began to spin.
As it contracted, its temperature and pressure increased.
The cloud spun faster and formed into a disk.
Scientists think the solar system at that time looked like these disk-shaped objects in the Orion Nebula.
New stars are forming in the Orion Nebula today.
Solar System Bodies Form
Gravity pulled a lot of material to the center of the cloud.
Temperatures and pressures at the center of the cloud were extreme.
It was so hot that nuclear fusion reactions began.
A star was born—the Sun.
In these reactions, hydrogen fuses to make helium.
Extreme amounts of energy are released.

Meanwhile, the outer parts of the disk were cooling off.
Matter condensed from the cloud.
