Look at the ramp in the Figure below .
A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane.
It can be used to raise an object off the ground.
The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of the ramp.
This is the distance over which the input force is applied.
The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance the object is raised.
For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the output distance is 2 meters.
Therefore, the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp is:
\text{Ideal Mechanical Advantage}=\frac{\text{Input distance}}{\text{Output distance}}=\frac{6 \ \text{m}}{2 \ \text{m}}=3
An ideal mechanical advantage of 3 means that the ramp ideally (in the absence of friction) multiplies the input force by a factor of 3.
The trade-off is that the input force must be applied over a greater distance than the object is lifted.
Mechanical advantage for a ramp
Q :
Assume that another ramp has a sloping surface of 8 m and a vertical height of 4 m.
What is the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp?
A :
The ramp has an ideal mechanical advantage of:
\text{Ideal Mechanical Advantage}=\frac{8 \ \text{m}}{4 \ \text{m}}=2
Mechanical Advantage of Different Types of Machines
Many machines—including inclined planes such as ramps—increase the strength of the force put into the machine but decrease the distance over which the force is applied.
