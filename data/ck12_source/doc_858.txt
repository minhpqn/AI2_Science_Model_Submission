The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis.
So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it.
Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse.
The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earthâ€™s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.
Human activities like burning gasoline in cars are contributing to a global change in our climate
Human activities like burning gasoline in cars are contributing to a global change in our climate.
During the carbon cycle, animals and plants add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through cellular respiration, and plants remove carbon dioxide through photosynthesis.
The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.
