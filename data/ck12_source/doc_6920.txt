Order them from the greatest electric potential to the least.
A, B, C
C, B, A
B, A, C
B, C, A
A = B = C \ldots theyâ€™re all at the same potential
The three arrows shown here represent the magnitudes of the electric field and the directions at the tail end of each arrow.
Consider the distribution of charges which would lead to this arrangement of electric fields.
Which of the following is most likely to be the case here?
A positive charge is located at point A
A negative charge is located at point B
A positive charge is located at point B and a negative charge is located at point C
A positive charge is located at point A and a negative charge is located at point C
Both answers a) and b) are possible
Particles A and B are both positively charged.
The arrows shown indicate the direction of the forces acting on them due to an applied electric field (not shown in the picture).
For each, draw in the electric field lines that would best match the observed force.
Calculate the electric field a distance of 4.0 \;\mathrm{mm} away from a -2.0 \ \mu \mathrm{C} charge.
Copy the arrangement of charges below.
Draw the electric field from the -2 \;\mathrm{C} charge in one color and the electric field from the +2 \;\mathrm{C} charge in a different color.
