Heat is supplied to the engine from some source at a higher temperature  (T_h)  .
Some of this heat is transferred into mechanical energy through work done  (W)  .
The rest of the input heat is transferred to some source at a lower temperature  (T_c)  until the system is in its original state.
A single cycle of such an engine can be illustrated as follows:
In effect, such an engine allows us to 'siphon off' part of the heat flow between the heat source and the heat sink.
The efficiency of such an engine is define as the ratio of net work performed to input heat; this is the fraction of heat energy converted to mechanical energy by the engine:  e = \frac{W}{Q_i} && \text{Efficiency of a heat engine}
If the engine does not lose energy to its surroundings (of course, all real engines do), then this efficiency can be rewritten as
e = \frac{Q_i-Q_o}{Q_i} && \text{Efficiency of a lossless heat engine}
An ideal engine, the most efficient theoretically possible, is called a Carnot Engine.
Its efficiency is given by the following formula, where the temperatures are, respectively, the temperature of the exhaust environment and the temperature of the heat input, in Kelvins.
In a Carnot engine heat is input and exhausted in isothermal cycles, and the efficiency is \eta = 1 -\frac{T_{\mathrm{cold}}}{T_\mathrm{hot}}  .
In all real engines heat is lost to the environment, thus the ideal efficiency is never even close to being obtained.
The Stirling engine is a real life heat engine that has a cycle similar to the theoretical Carnot cycle.
The Stirling engine is very efficient compared to a gasoline engine and could become an important player in today's world where green energy and efficiency will reign supreme.
Some Important Points
In a practical heat engine, the change in internal energy must be zero over a complete cycle.
Therefore, over a complete cycle W = \Delta Q .
The work done by a gas during a portion of a cycle = P\Delta\!V , note \Delta\!V can be positive or negative.
Gas Heat Engines
When gas pressure-forces are used to move an object then work is done on the object by the expanding gas.
