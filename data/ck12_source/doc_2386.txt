State why graphs are useful in science.
Describe bar graphs and their uses.
Describe circle graphs and what they show.
Describe line graphs and how they are used.
Tornadoes, like the one pictured here, are very powerful storms that can cause incredible destruction.
Their winds may exceed 300 miles per hour, and they can completely level towns and neighborhoods in just minutes.
Because tornadoes can be so serious, they are closely monitored, measured, and counted.
As a result, there are a lot of data on tornadoes.
One way to present these data is with graphs.
Using Graphs in Science
Graphs are very useful tools in science.
They can help you visualize a set of data.
With a graph, you can actually see what all the numbers in a data table mean.
Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs.
Each type of graph is suitable for showing a different type of data.
The data in Table below shows the average number of tornadoes per year for the ten U.S. cities that have the most tornadoes.
The data were averaged over the time period 1950–2007.
