It also waterproofs the tissues so they don’t leak, which makes them more efficient at transporting fluids.
Because most other organisms cannot break down lignin, it helps protect plants from herbivores and parasites.
Leaves are rich in chloroplasts that function as solar collectors and food factories.
The first leaves were very small, but leaves became larger over time.
Roots are vascular organs that can penetrate soil and even rock.
They absorb water and minerals from soil and carry them to leaves.
They also anchor a plant in the soil.
Roots evolved from rhizoids, which nonvascular plants had used for absorption.
Land plants evolved a dominant diploid sporophyte generation.
This was adaptive because diploid individuals are less likely to suffer harmful effects of mutations.
They have two copies of each gene, so if a mutation occurs in one gene, they have a backup copy.
This is extremely important on land, where there’s a lot of solar radiation.
With all these advantages, it’s easy to see why vascular plants spread quickly and widely on land.
Many nonvascular plants went extinct as vascular plants became more numerous.
Vascular plants are now the dominant land plants on Earth.
The earliest plants are thought to have evolved in the ocean from a green alga ancestor.
Plants were among the earliest organisms to leave the water and colonize land.
The evolution of vascular tissues allowed plants to grow larger and thrive on land.
