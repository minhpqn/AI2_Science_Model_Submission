These alkanes are called straight-chain alkanes because the carbon atoms are connected in one continuous chain with no branches.
Naming and writing structural and molecular formulas for the straight-chain alkanes is straightforward.
The name of each alkane consists of a prefix that specifies the number of carbon atoms and the ending –ane.
The molecular formula follows the pattern of C n H 2n+2 where  n is the number of carbons in the chain.
The Table below lists the first ten members of the alkane series.
