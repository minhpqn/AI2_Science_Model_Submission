Mollusks in Scientific Studies
Several mollusks are ideal subjects for scientific investigation of the nervous system.
The giant squid has a sophisticated nervous system and a complex brain for study.
The California sea slug, also called the California sea hare, is used in studies of learning and memory because it has a simple nervous system, consisting of just a few thousand large, easily identified neurons.
These neurons are responsible for a variety of learning tasks.
Some slug brain studies have even allowed scientists to better understand human brains.
Some octopuses and squid are incredibly smart.
