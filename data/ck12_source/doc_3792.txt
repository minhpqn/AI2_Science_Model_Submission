Most biologists agree there are three domains of life on Earth:
Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota (see Figure below ).
Both Bacteria and Archaea consist of single-celled prokaryotes.
Eukaryota consists of all eukaryotes, from single-celled protists to humans.
This domain includes the Animalia (animals), Plantae (plants), Fungi (fungi), and Protista (protists) kingdoms.
This phylogenetic tree is based on comparisons of ribosomal RNA base sequences among living organisms.
The tree divides all organisms into three domains:
Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
Humans and other animals belong to the Eukarya domain.
From this tree, organisms that make up the domain Eukarya appear to have shared a more recent common ancestor with Archaea than Bacteria.
Classification is an important step in understanding life on Earth.
All modern classification systems have their roots in the Linnaean classification system.
The Linnaean system is based on similarities in obvious physical traits.
It consists of a hierarchy of taxa, from the kingdom to the species.
Each species is given a unique two-word Latin name.
The recently added domain is a larger and more inclusive taxon than the kingdom.
