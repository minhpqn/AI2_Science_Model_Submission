In addition to metalloids, they also contain metals, nonmetals, or both.
Groups 13–16 fall between the transition metals (in groups 3–12) and the nonmetals called halogens (in group 17).
The periodic table
What Are Metalloids?
Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six members: boron (B), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and tellurium (Te).
Metalloids have some properties of metals (elements that can conduct electricity) and some properties of nonmetals (elements that cannot conduct electricity).
For example, most metalloids can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals.
Metalloids also tend to be shiny like metals, but brittle like nonmetals.
Chemically, metalloids may behave like metals or nonmetals, depending on their number of valence electrons.

Q:
Why does the chemical behavior of an element depend on its number of valence electrons?
A:
Valence electrons are the electrons in an atom’s outer energy level that may be involved in chemical reactions with other atoms.
Group 13:
Boron Group
Group 13 of the periodic table is also called the boron group because boron (B) is the first element at the top of the group (see Figure below ).
Boron is also the only metalloid in this group.
The other four elements in the group—aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and thallium (Tl)—are all metals.
Group 13 elements have three valence electrons and are fairly reactive.
