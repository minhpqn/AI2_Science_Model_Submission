transcription :
The process of making mRNA from the information in the DNA (gene) sequence.
translation :
The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.
zygote :
A fertilized egg; the first cell of a new organism.
As a eukaryotic cell prepares to divide, the DNA and associated proteins coil into a structure, known as a chromosome.
After DNA replication, a resulting chromosome will consist of two identical sister chromatids, attached at a region called the centromere.
Any cell containing two sets of chromosomes is said to be diploid; the zygote forms from the fusion of two haploid gametes.
