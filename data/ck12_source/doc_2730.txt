Structure of ethylene and polyethylene
Carbon has a unique ability to form many covalent bonds, so it often forms polymers.
A polymer is a large molecule that is made up of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers, which are joined together by covalent bonds.
Natural polymers include rubber and cellulose.
Synthetic polymers include plastics such as polyethylene.

How annoying!
Just as you start to write in your notebook, your pencil lead breaks.
Actually, pencil “leads” aren’t made of lead at all.
They are made of a form of carbon called graphite.
How carbon atoms are arranged in graphite explains why it’s suitable for writing—and also why it breaks so easily.
