For example, when the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) react, they form a neutral solution of water and the salt sodium chloride (NaCl).
This reaction is represented by the chemical equation:
NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H 2 O.
In this reaction, hydroxide ions (OH - ) from the base combine with hydrogen ions (H + ) from the acid to form water.
The other ions in the solution (Na + ) and (Cl - ) combine to form sodium chloride.
Acids and Bases in Organisms
Enzymes are needed to speed up biochemical reactions.
Most enzymes require a specific range of pH in order to do their job.
For example, the enzyme pepsin , which helps break down proteins in the human stomach, requires a very acidic environment in order to function.
Strong acid is secreted into the stomach, allowing pepsin to work.
Once the contents of the stomach enter the small intestine, where most digestion occurs, the acid must be neutralized.
This is because enzymes that work in the small intestine need a basic environment.
An organ near the small intestine, called the pancreas, secretes bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 - ) into the small intestine to neutralize the stomach acid.
Bicarbonate ions play an important role in neutralizing acids throughout the body.
Bicarbonate ions are especially important for protecting tissues of the central nervous system from changes in pH.
The central nervous system includes the brain, which is the body’s control center.
If pH deviates too far from normal, the central nervous system cannot function properly.
This can have a drastic effect on the rest of the body.
acid :
A solution with a pH lower than 7.
