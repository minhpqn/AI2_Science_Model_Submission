Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state.
Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things.
Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes.
This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water.
The lower density of ice means that it floats on water.
For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes.
This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.
Water and Life
The human body is about 70% water (not counting the water in body fat, which varies from person to person).
The body needs all this water to function normally.
Just why is so much water required by human beings and other organisms?
Water can dissolve many substances that organisms need, and it is necessary for many biochemical reactions.
The examples below are among the most important biochemical processes that occur in living things, but they are just two of many ways that water is involved in biochemical reactions.
Photosynthesis—In this process, cells use the energy in sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen.
Water is a reactant in this process.
The reactions of photosynthesis can be represented by the chemical equation
6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Energy → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 .
Cellular respiration—In this process, cells break down glucose in the presence of oxygen and release carbon dioxide, water (a product), and energy.
The reactions of cellular respiration can be represented by the chemical equation
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Energy.
