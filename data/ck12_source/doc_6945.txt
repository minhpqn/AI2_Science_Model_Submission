Charged particles in motion also generate magnetic fields.
The most frequently used example is a current carrying wire, since current is literally moving charged particles.
The magnitude of a field generated by a wire depends on distance to the wire and strength of the current (I)  (see 'Key Equations' section) :
Meanwhile, its direction can be found using the so called first right hand rule : point your thumb in the direction of the current.
Then, curl your fingers around the wire.
The direction your fingers will point in the same direction as the field.
Be sure to use your right hand!
Sometimes, it is necessary to represent such three dimensional fields on a two dimensional sheet of paper.
The following example illustrates how this is done.
In the example above, a current is running along a wire towards the top of your page.
The magnetic field is circling the current carrying wire in loops which are perpendicular to the page.
Where these loops intersect this piece of paper, we use the symbol \bigodot to represent where the magnetic field is coming out of the page and the symbol \bigotimes to represent where the magnetic field is going into the page .
This convention can be used for all vector quantities: fields, forces, velocities, etc.
You are standing right next to a current carrying wire and decide to throw your magnetic field sensor some distance perpendicular to the wire.
When you go to retrieve your sensor, it shows the magnetic field where it landed to be 4*10^{-5}\;\text{T} .
If you know the wire was carrying 300A, how far did you throw the sensor?
To solve this problem, we will just use the equation given above and solve for the radius.
B&=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi r}\\\r&=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi B}\\\r&=\frac{4\pi*10^{-7}\:\text{Tm/A}* 300\:\text{A}}{2\pi* 4*10^{-5}\:\text{T}}\\\r&=1.5\:\text{m}\\\
