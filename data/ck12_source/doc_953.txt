U-235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope, and it constitutes less than 1% of naturally occurring uranium.
A fissile substance is a substance capable of sustaining a chain reaction of nuclear fission.
It has been projected that the world's supply of U-235 will be exhausted in less than 200 years.
It is possible, however, to convert U-238 to a fissionable isotope that will function as a fuel for nuclear reactors.
The fissionable isotope is plutonium-239 and is produced by the following series of reactions:
{^{238}_{\phantom{0}92}\text{U}}+{^1_0n} \rightarrow {^{239}_{\phantom{0}92}\text{U}} \rightarrow {^{\phantom{-}0}_{-1}e} + {^{239}_{\phantom{0}93}\text{Np}} \rightarrow {^{\phantom{-}0}_{-1}e} + {^{239}_{\phantom{0}94}\text{Pu}}
The final product from this series of reactions is plutonium-239, which has a half-life of 24,000 years and is another nuclear reactor fuel.
This series of reactions can be made to occur inside an operating nuclear reactor by replacing some of the control rods with rods of U-238.
As the nuclear decay process proceeds inside the reactor, it produces more fuel than it uses.
It would take about 20 such breeder reactors to produce enough fuel to operate one additional reactor.
The use of breeder reactors would extend the fuel supply a hundred fold.
The problem with breeder reactors, however, is that plutonium is an extremely deadly poison.
Furthermore, unlike ordinary fission reactors, it is possible for out-of-control breeder reactors to explode.
None of the civilian nuclear power plants in the U.S. are breeder reactors.
A nuclear reactor is a device in which a nuclear chain reaction is carried out at a controlled rate.
The nuclear reaction boils water into steam, the steam is used to spin a turbine, and the turbine turns an electrical generator.
It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor.
Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium and can be used as fuel in a fission reactor.
Once the supply of U-235 is acquired, it is placed in a series of long cylindrical tubes called fuel rods.
These fuel cylinders are bundled together with control rods made of neutron-absorbing material.
