Star temperatures are measured in degrees kelvin.
The lowest temperature on the kelvin scale is absolute zero.
That means molecules have no motion.
Kelvin is related to Celsius and Fahrenheit in these ways:
[°C] = [K] − 273.15
[°F] = [K] × 9/5 − 459.67
A graph of the brightness (absolute magnitude) of stars versus their color (temperature) is pictured below ( Figure below ).
This is called Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram plots luminosity against star color with the hottest stars on the left side
The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram plots luminosity (absolute magnitude) against the color of the stars ranging from the high-temperature blue-white stars on the left side of the diagram to the low temperature red stars on the right side.
Most stars fall along the main sequence curve.
Stars in the main sequence fuse hydrogen into helium in the core.
The horizontal branch also has many stars.
These fuse helium in the core and burn hydrogen surrounding the core.
Other stars are found in other regions.
This diagram compares the relative sizes of stars of different masses
Relative sizes of stars of different masses.
This illustration ( Figure above ) shows the relative sizes of stars and their mass compared to the Sun.
Red dwarfs are less massive and much smaller in size than the Sun.
This means they have a very long lifetime.
