The right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body.
The right ventricle pumps oxygen-poor blood toward the lungs, where it receives oxygen.
The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs.
The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood out of the heart to the rest of the body.
Blood Flow Through the Heart
Blood flows through the heart in two separate loops.
You can think of them as a “left side loop” and a “right side loop.” The right side of the heart collects oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it into the lungs, where it releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen.
The left side carries the oxygen-rich blood back from the lungs into the left side of the heart, which then pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.
The blood delivers oxygen to the cells of the body and returns to the heart oxygen-poor.
To move blood through the heart, the cardiac muscle needs to contract in an organized way.
Blood first enters the atria ( Figure below ).
When the atria contract, blood is pushed into the ventricles.
After the ventricles fill with blood, they contract, and blood is pushed out of the heart.
The heart is mainly composed of cardiac muscle.
These muscle cells contract in unison, causing the heart itself to contract and generating enough force to push the blood out.
So how is the blood kept from flowing back on itself?
Valves ( Figure below ) in the heart keep the blood flowing in one direction.
The valves do this by opening and closing in one direction only.
Blood only moves forward through the heart.
The valves stop the blood from flowing backward.
