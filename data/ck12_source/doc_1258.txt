How fast is the spreading occurring?
How does the pattern of magnetic stripes give evidence for seafloor spreading?
How does the topography of the seafloor give evidence for seafloor spreading?
How does seafloor spreading fit into the idea that continents move about on Earth’s surface?
Earth's Tectonic Plates
Describe lithospheric plates.
What do you get when you combine continental drift and seafloor spreading?
Plate tectonics!
In the next two concepts, we will analyze those words.
What is a plate?
What is tectonics?
Then we put it together.
Alfred Wegener, who died on the Greenland ice sheet at the age of 50, didn't live to.
What is a Plate?
What portion of Earth makes up the “plates” in plate tectonics?
Again, the answer came about in part due to war.
In this case, the Cold War.
The scientists set up seismometer networks during the 1950s and early 1960s.
The purpose was to see if other nations were testing atomic bombs.
Since seismometers measure ground shaking, they also recorded earthquakes.
