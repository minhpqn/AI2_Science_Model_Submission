In methane, which carbon electrons are not involved in bonding?
What is the hybridization around each carbon in ethene?
What are the two bonds in C=C?
What is the shape of the ethene molecule?
How are the ethyne pi bonds oriented in relation to each other?
pi bond ( \pi bond):
A bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in a side-by-side fashion with the electron density concentrated above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonding atoms.
sigma bond ( \sigma bond):
A bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in an end-to-end fashion, with the electron density concentrated between the nuclei of the bonding atoms.
