The amount of reactants and products do not have to be equal.
However, after equilibrium is attained, the amounts of reactants and products will be constant.
The description of equilibrium in this concept refers primarily to equilibrium between reactants and products in a chemical reaction.
Other types of equilibrium include phase equilibrium and solution equilibrium.
A phase equilibrium occurs when a substance is in equilibrium between two states.
For example, a stoppered flask of water attains equilibrium when the rate of evaporation is equal to the rate of condensation.
A solution equilibrium occurs when a solid substance is in a saturated solution.
At this point, the rate of dissolution is equal to the rate of recrystallization.
Although these are all different types of transformations, most of the rules regarding equilibrium apply to any situation in which a process occurs reversibly.
The concept of chemical equilibrium is described.
Conditions for chemical equilibrium are listed.
