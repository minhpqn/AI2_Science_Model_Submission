This causes conditions to become increasingly extreme.
An example of positive feedback is milk production by a mother for her baby.
As the baby suckles, nerve messages from the nipple cause the pituitary gland to secrete prolactin.
Prolactin, in turn, stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk, so the baby suckles more.
This causes more prolactin to be secreted and more milk to be produced.
This example is one of the few positive feedback mechanisms in the human body.
What do you think would happen if milk production by the mammary glands was controlled by negative feedback instead?
Most hormones are controlled by negative feedback, in which the hormone feeds back to decrease its own production.
This type of feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become too extreme.
Positive feedback is much less common because it causes conditions to become increasingly extreme.
