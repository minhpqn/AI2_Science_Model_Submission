Ribosomes are organelles made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm.
The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding the genetic messages within another type of RNA, called mRNA for messenger RNA, into amino acids.
After being made in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they direct protein synthesis.
The eukaryotic cell nucleus.
Visible in this diagram are the ribosome-studded double membranes of the nuclear envelope, the DNA (as chromatin), and the nucleolus.
Within the cell nucleus is a viscous liquid called nucleoplasm, similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus.
The chromatin (which is normally invisible), is visible in this figure only to show that it is spread out throughout the nucleus.
chromatin :
Grainy material form of uncoiled DNA; form of DNA during interphase of the cell cycle.
chromosome :
The coiled structure of DNA and histone proteins; allows for the precise separation of replicated DNA; forms during prophase of mitosis and meiosis.
gene :
A segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a single polypeptide.
gene expression :
The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.
nuclear envelope :
Double phospholipid membrane of the nucleus; encloses the genetic material.
nuclear pore :
Tiny hole in the nuclear envelope.
nucleolus :
