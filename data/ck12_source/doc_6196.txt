In the above equation, the overall charge is zero, or neutral, on both sides of the equation.
As a general rule, if you balance the molecular equation properly, the net ionic equation will end up being balanced by both mass and charge.
Sample Problem:
Writing and Balancing Net Ionic Equations
When aqueous solutions of copper(II) chloride and potassium phosphate are mixed, a precipitate of copper(II) phosphate is formed.
Write a balanced net ionic equation for this reaction.
Step 1:
Plan the problem .
Write and balance the molecular equation first, making sure that all formulas are correct.
Then write the ionic equation, showing all aqueous substances as ions.
Carry through any coefficients.
Finally, eliminate spectator ions and write the net ionic equation.
Step 2:
Solve .
3\text{CuCl}_2(aq)+2\text{K}_3\text{PO}_4(aq) \rightarrow 6\text{KCl}(aq)+\text{Cu}_3(\text{PO}_4)_2(s)
3\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq)+6\text{Cl}^-(aq)+6\text{K}^+(aq)+2\text{PO}^{3^-}_4(aq) \rightarrow 6\text{K}^+(aq)+6\text{Cl}^-(aq)+\text{Cu}_3(\text{PO}_4)_2(s)
Notice that the balancing is carried through when writing the dissociated ions.
For example, there are six chloride ions on the reactant side because the coefficient of 3 is multiplied by the subscript of 2 in the copper(II) chloride formula.
The spectator ions are K + and Cl âˆ’ and can be eliminated.
