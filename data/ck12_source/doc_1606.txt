It contains most of the genetic material (the DNA ) of the cell.
The genetic material of the nucleus is like a set of instructions.
These instructions tell the cell how to build molecules needed for the cell to function properly.
That is, the DNA tells the cell how to build molecules needed for life.
The nucleus is surrounded by the nuclear envelope , a double membrane (two phospholipid bilayers) that controls what goes in and out of the nucleus.
The nucleus also has holes embedded in the nuclear envelope.
These holes are known as nuclear pores , and they allow things to flow in and out of the nucleus.
Inside of the nucleus, you will find the chromosomes .
Chromosomes are strands of DNA wrapped around proteins.
They contain genes , or small units of genetic material (DNA) that contains the code for the creation of a protein.
Human cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).
There are hundreds to thousands of genes on each chromosome.
The nucleus of many cells also contains a central region called the nucleolus .
The job of the nucleolus is to build ribosomes.
These ribosomes flow out the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.
Ribosomes are organelles that make proteins in the cytoplasm.
See the composition of the nucleus pictured below ( Figure below ).
Position of the nucleus inside a cell
In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is kept in the nucleus.
The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope.
