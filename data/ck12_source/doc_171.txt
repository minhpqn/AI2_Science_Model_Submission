The control panel of the space shuttle Atlantis displays dozens of measurements
Measurements are a basic necessity in science.
Scientists have designed thousands of different tools to help in the vital process of measuring.
In this image of the control panel of the space shuttle Atlantis, we see dozens of readouts from measuring systems.
We already know that observations are an important part of the scientific method.
Hypotheses are accepted or rejected based on how well they explain observations.
Some observations, such as "the plant turned brown" are qualitative ; these observations have no associated numbers.
A quantitative observation includes numbers, and is also called a measurement.
A measurement is obtained by comparing an object to some standard.
Any observation is useful to a scientist, but quantitative observations are commonly considered more useful.
Even if the measurement is an estimate, scientists usually make quantitative measurements in every experiment.
Consider the following pair of observations.
When the volume of a gas is decreased, its pressure is increased.
When the volume of a gas is reduced from 2.0 liters to 1.0 liter, the pressure increases from 3.0 atm to 6.0 atm.
A great deal more information, and more useful information, is available in the second observation.
Since accurate measurement is a vital tool for doing science, a consistent set of units for measurement is necessary.
Physicists throughout the world use the International System of Units (also called the SI system).
The SI system is basically the metric system, which is convenient because units of different size are related by powers of 10.
The system has physical standards for length, mass, and time.
