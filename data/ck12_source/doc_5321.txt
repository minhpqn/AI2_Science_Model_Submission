The structure of DNA was still unknown, and many scientists were not convinced that genes from bacteria and more complex organisms could be similar.

Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase
In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase put this skepticism to rest.
They conclusively demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the T2 bacteriophage , a virus that infects bacteria, to prove this point.
A virus is essentially DNA (or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat ( Figure below ).
To reproduce, a virus must infect a cell and use that host cellâ€™s machinery to make more viruses, a replicative process known as the lytic cycle .
The T2 bacteriophage can quickly turn an Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria into a T2 producing system.
But to do that, the genetic material from T2, which could only be either protein or DNA, must be transferred to the bacteria.
Which one was it?

A 2-dimensional representation is on the left, and a 3-dimensional representation is on the right.
The phage is essentially nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat.
Hershey and Chase performed a series of classic experiments, taking advantage of the fact that T2 is essentially just DNA and protein.
In the experiments, T2 phages with either radioactive 32 P-labeled DNA or radioactive 35 S-labeled protein were used to infect bacteria.
Either the radioactive proteins or radioactive DNA would be transferred to the bacteria, depending on which one was the genetic material.
Thus, identifying which one was transferred would identify the genetic material.
In both experiments, bacteria were separated from the phage coats by blending, followed by centrifugation.
Hershey and Chase then asked which phase following centrifugation was radioactive: the supernatant or the cell pellet.
