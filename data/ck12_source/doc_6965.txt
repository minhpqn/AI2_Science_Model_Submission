Does the voltage of the capacitor increase, decrease or stay the same?
Explain
The dielectric is now removed from the middle with battery attached.
What happens?
Answers to Selected Problems
a. 100 \;\mathrm{V} b.
Because as charges build up they repel each other from the plate and a greater voltage is needed to create a stronger electric field forcing charge to flow
a. decrease b. negative work ('sucked in') c.
Goes back up to what it was before inserted dielectric d.
V is constant, since capacitance goes down, charge must go down.
There's probably a discharge across the capacitor.
Describe how energy is stored in a capacitor and calculate said energy.
Students learn how energy is stored in a capacitor and how to calculate said energy.
The electric potential energy, U_{\text{C}}  , stored in the capacitor is given by
U_{\text{C}} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2
Suppose we have two parallel metal plates set a distance d from one another.
We place a positive charge on one of the plates and a negative charge on the other.
In this configuration, there will be a uniform electric field between the plates pointing from, and normal to, the plate carrying the positive charge.
The magnitude of this field is given by E = \frac{V}{d} where V is the potential difference (voltage) between the two plates.
The amount of charge, Q , held by each plate is given by Q = CV where again V is the voltage difference between the plates and C is the capacitance of the plate configuration.
