What is a solid?
Why does a solid have a fixed shape and fixed volume?
Create a table comparing and contrasting crystalline and amorphous solids.
Include an example of each type of solid in your table.
Diamonds like the one pictured in the Figure below are the hardest of all minerals.
Is a diamond a crystalline or an amorphous solid?
How do you know?
Identify properties of matter in the liquid state.
Describe surface tension and viscosity of liquids.
Colored by lights at night, an incredible amount of water plunges continuously over the sheer rock wall of Niagara Falls.
If you stand close to the falls, the roar of the water is almost deafening, and the rushing water drenches you with spray.
No wonder Niagara Falls was once named one of the seven natural wonders of the world!
It’s amazing how such a common substance—water—can be so impressive.
Water and Other Liquids
Water is the most common substance on Earth, and most of it exists in the liquid state.
A liquid is one of four well-known states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma states.
The particles of liquids are in close contact with each other but not as tightly packed as the particles in solids.
The particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container.
However, they cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container, as particles of a gas can.
If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface of the liquid will be exposed to the air, like the vinegar in the bottle pictured in the Figure below .
