What is the concentration of the H 2 and the HBr at equilibrium?
Since the reaction begins with only HBr and the mole ratio of H 2 to Br 2 is 1:1, the concentration of H 2 at equilibrium is also 0.00243 M.
The equilibrium expression can be rearranged to solve for the concentration of HBr at equilibrium.
K_{eq} & = \frac{[\text{HBr}]^2}{[\text{H}_2][\text{Br}_2]}\\\left [ \text{HBr} \right ] & = \sqrt{K_{eq}[\text{H}_2][\text{Br}_2]} \\& = \sqrt{2.18 \times 10^6 (0.00243)(0.00243)} = 3.59 \text{ M}
Since the value of the equilibrium constant is very high, the concentration of HBr is much greater than that of H 2 and Br 2 at equilibrium.
Calculation of an equilibrium constant is described.

How far down?
There are people who enjoy going up in an airplane, strapping on a parachute, and diving out the door to free-fall and then open the chute and drop to the ground.
This stressful activity (so they say) relieves the stress of everyday life.
The release of adrenaline caused by this stressful behavior is said to promote a mood enhancement that helps you deal better with other stresses in your daily life.
Le Châtelier’s Principle
Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936) and his description of how a system responds to a stress to equilibrium has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle :
When a chemical system that is at equilibrium is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond in order to relieve the stress.
Stresses to a chemical system involve changes in the concentration of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system.
