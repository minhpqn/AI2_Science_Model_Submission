Evolution of Modern Mammals
Summarize the evolution of modern mammals.
Why so many different types of large mammals?
Elephants, zebras, gazelles, giraffes, rhinoceros, lions, and hippopotamuses, to name just some of the animals of Africa.
Each species must have its own niche, otherwise they could not coexist.
So, there must be a role for each species within their ecosystem.
Evolution of Modern Mammals
The Cretaceous Period ended with another mass extinction.
This occurred about 65 million years ago.
All of the dinosaurs went extinct at that time.
Did the extinction of the dinosaurs allow mammals to take over?
Scientists have long assumed that the extinction of the dinosaurs opened up many niches for mammals to exploit.
Presumably, this led to an explosion of new species of mammals early in Cenozoic Era.
Few mammalian fossils from the early Cenozoic have been found to support this theory.
Even so, it was still widely accepted until recently.
View from the Mammalian Supertree
In 2007, an international team of scientists compared the DNA of almost all known species of living mammals.
They used the data to create a supertree of mammalian evolution.
The supertree shows that placental mammals started to diversify as early as 95 million years ago.
What explains the diversification of mammals long before the dinosaurs went extinct?
