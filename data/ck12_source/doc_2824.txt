This machine scans a patient’s body and detects radiation.
A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment.
This background radiation is generally assumed to be safe for living things.
Long-term or high-dose exposure to radiation can harm living things and damage nonliving materials such as metals.
One reason radiation is dangerous is that it generally can’t be detected with the senses.
It can be detected only with devices such as Geiger counters.
Radiation has several important uses, including diagnosing and treating cancer.
