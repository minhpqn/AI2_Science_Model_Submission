Metallic bonds explain many of the properties of metals.
This coil of wire is made of the metal copper.
Like other metals, copper is shiny, can be formed into wires, and conducts electricity.
A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions.
Bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence electrons.
Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
There are three different types of chemical bonds: covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds.
