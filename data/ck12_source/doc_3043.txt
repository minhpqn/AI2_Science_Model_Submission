Relate the density of an object to its ability to float.
What could be more refreshing than floating in cool water on a hot summer day?
Water and other fluids have a special force that allows people and things to float in them.
The force is called buoyant force.
What Is Buoyant Force?
Buoyant force is an upward force that fluids exert on any object that is placed in them.
The ability of fluids to exert this force is called buoyancy .
What explains buoyant force?
A fluid exerts pressure in all directions, but the pressure is greater at greater depth.
Therefore, the fluid below an object, where the fluid is deeper, exerts greater pressure on the object than the fluid above it.
You can see in the Figure below how this works.
Buoyant force explains why the girl pictured above can float in water.

Q :
You’ve probably noticed that some things don’t float in water.
For example, if you drop a stone in water, it will sink to the bottom rather than floating.
If buoyant force applies to all objects in fluids, why do some objects sink instead of float?
A :
The answer has to do with their weight.
