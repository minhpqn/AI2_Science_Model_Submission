The technological design process is a step-by-step approach to finding a solution to a problem.
Often, the main challenge in technological design is finding a solution that works within the constraints, or limits, on the design.
All technological designs have constraints.
Q:
Assume you want to design a kite.
What might be some constraints on your design?
A:
Possible constraints might include the shape and size of the kite and the materials you use to make it.
Physical and Social Constraints
Technological design constraints may be physical or social.
Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and properties of materials.
A kite, for example, will fly only if its shape allows air currents to lift it.
Otherwise, gravity will keep it on the ground.
Social design constraints include factors such as ease of use, safety, attractiveness, and cost.
For example, a kite string should be easy to unwind as the wind carries the kite higher.
Weighing the Options
All technological designs have trade-offs because no design is perfect.
For example, a design might be very good at solving a problem, but it might be too expensive to be practical.
Or a design might be very attractive, but it might not be safe to use.
Choosing the best design often involves weighing the pros and cons of different options and deciding which ones are most important.
