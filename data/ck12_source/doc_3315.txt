Q:
The tungsten wire inside a light bulb is extremely thin.
How does this help it do its job?
A:
The extremely thin wire has more resistance than a wider wire would.
This helps the wire resist electric current and change it to light.
In physics, resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges that occurs as electric current travels through matter.
The SI unit for resistance is the ohm.
All materials have resistance.
How much resistance a material has depends on the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature.
Resistance is a hindrance when a material is being used to transmit electric current.
Resistance is helpful when a material is being used to produce heat or light.
