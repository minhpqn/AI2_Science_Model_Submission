Finally, the molar volume of a gas will be used to convert to liters of hydrogen.
\text{g Al} \rightarrow \text{mol Al} \rightarrow \text{mol H}_2 \rightarrow \text{L H}_2
Step 2:
Solve.
2.00 \text{ g Al} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol Al}}{26.98 \text{ g Al}} \times \frac{3 \text{ mol H}_2}{2 \text{ mol Al}} \times \frac{22.4 \text{ L H}_2}{1 \text{ mol H}_2} = 2.49 \text{ L H}_2
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The volume result is in liters.
For much smaller amounts, it may be convenient to convert to milliliters.
The answer here has three significant figures.
Because the molar volume is a measured quantity of 22.4 L/mol, three is the maximum number of significant figures for this type of problem.
Sample Problem:
Volume-Mass Stoichiometry
Calcium oxide is used to remove sulfur dioxide generated in coal-burning power plants according to the following reaction.
2\text{CaO}(s) + 2\text{SO}_2 (g)+\text{O}_2 (g) \rightarrow 2\text{CaSO}_4 (s)
What mass of calcium oxide is required to react completely with 1.4 × 10 3 L of sulfur dioxide?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given: 1.4 × 10 3  L = SO 2
2 mol SO 2 = 2 mol CaO
