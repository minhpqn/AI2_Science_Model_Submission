When dealing with oxidation numbers, we must always include the charge on the atom.
Another way to determine the oxidation number of Mn in this compound is to recall that the permanganate anion (MnO 4 ) has a charge of -1.
In this case:
Mn + 4(-2) &= -1 \\Mn -8 &= -1 \\Mn &= +7
Sample Problem:
What is the oxidation number for iron in Fe 2 O 3 ?
& O \text{ is} -2 \ (\text{rule } 2) \\& 2Fe + 3(-2) = 0 \\& 2Fe = 6 \\& Fe = 3.
If we have the compound FeO, then  Fe + (-2) = 0 and Fe = 2 .
Iron is one of those materials that can have more than one oxidation number.
The halogens (except for fluorine) can also have more than one number.
In the compound NaCl, we know that Na is +1, so Cl must be -1.
But what about NaClO 3 ?
Na & =1 \\O & = -2 \\1 + Cl + 3(-2) &= 0 \\1 + Cl - 6 & = 0. \\Cl - 5 &= 0 \\Cl &= +5.
Not quite what we expected, but Cl, Br, and I will exhibit multiple oxidation numbers in compounds.
