Describe the role of energy in exothermic reactions.
Give examples of exothermic reactions.
This mushroom cloud was produced in a 1953 nuclear bomb test in Nevada.
There’s no doubt that the explosion gave off a huge amount of energy.
Although not as impressive as nuclear reactions, many chemical reactions also give off energy.
These reactions are called exothermic reactions.
What Is an Exothermic Reaction?
All chemical reactions involve energy.
Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products.
In some chemical reactions, called endothermic reactions, less energy is released when new bonds form in the products than is needed to break bonds in the reactants.
The opposite is true of exothermic reactions.
In an exothermic reaction , it takes less energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products.
Energy Change in Exothermic Reactions
The word exothermic means “releasing heat.” Energy, often in the form of heat, is released as an exothermic reaction proceeds.
This is illustrated in the Figure below .
The general equation for an exothermic reaction is:
Reactants → Products + Energy
Change in energy for an exothermic reaction
Note: ΔH represents the change in energy.
If the energy produced in an exothermic reaction is released as heat, it results in a rise in temperature.
