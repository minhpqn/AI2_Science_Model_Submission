Most compounds containing the bromide ion are soluble, but lead(II) is an exception.
Therefore, the cesium and nitrate ions are spectator ions and the lead(II) bromide is a precipitate.
The balanced net ionic reaction is:
\text{Pb}^{2+} (aq)+2\text{Br}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{PbBr}_2(s)
Solubility rules allow prediction of what products will be insoluble in water.
Work the problems at the link below:
Are all alkali metal salts soluble?
What chloride salts are not soluble?
Would you expect sodium silicate to dissolve?
Is lead(II) sulfate soluble?
