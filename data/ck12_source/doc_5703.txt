Think about your result.
This very small wavelength is about 1/20th of the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
Looking at the equation, as the speed of the electron decreases, its wavelength increases.
The wavelengths of everyday large objects with much greater masses should be very small.
If we were to calculate the wavelength of a 0.145 kg baseball thrown at a speed of 40 m/s, we would come up with an extremely short wavelength on the order of 10 -34 m.
This wavelength is impossible to detect even with advanced scientific equipment.
Indeed, while all objects move with wavelike motion, we never notice it because the wavelengths are far too short.
On the other hand, particles with measurable wavelengths are all very small.
However, the wave nature of the electron proved to be a key development in a new understanding of the nature of the electron.
An electron that is confined to a particular space around the nucleus of an atom can only move around that atom in such a way that its electron wave “fits” the size of the atom correctly.
This means that the frequencies of electron waves are quantized .
Based on the  E=hv equation, the quantized frequencies means that electrons can only exist in an atom at specific energies, as Bohr had previously theorized.

The circumference of the orbit in (A) allows the electron wave to fit perfectly into the orbit.
This is an allowed orbit.
In (B), the electron wave does not fit properly into the orbit, so this orbit is not allowed.
The deBroglie wave equations allows calculation of the wavelength of any moving object.
As the speed of the electron decreases, its wavelength increases.
