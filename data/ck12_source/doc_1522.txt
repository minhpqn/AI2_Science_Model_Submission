How much humidity is in the air on a tremendously hot and humid day?
Pressure and Density of the Atmosphere
Define air density and air pressure.
Explain how they change with increasing altitude.
Have your ears ever popped?
If your ears have ever "popped," you have experienced a change in air pressure.
Ears "pop" because the air pressure is different on the inside and the outside of your ears.
Properties of Air
We usually canâ€™t sense the air around us unless it is moving.
But air has the same basic properties as other matter.
For example, air has mass, volume, and, of course, density.
Density of Air
Density is mass per unit volume.
Density is a measure of how closely molecules are packed together.
The closer together they are, the greater the density.
Since air is a gas, the molecules can pack tightly or spread out.
The density of air varies from place to place.
Air density depends on several factors.
One is temperature.
Like other materials, warm air is less dense than cool air.
