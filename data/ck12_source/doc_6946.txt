Magnet and Compass (PhET Simulation)
Sketch the magnetic field lines for the horseshoe magnet shown here.
Then, show the direction in which the two compasses (shown as circles) should point considering their positions.
In other words, draw an arrow in the compass that represents North in relation to the compass magnet.
Find the magnetic field a distance of 20 cm from a wire that is carrying 3 A of electrical current.
In order to measure the current from big power lines the worker simply clamps a device around the wire.
This provides safety when dealing with such high currents.
The worker simply measures the magnetic field and deduces the current using the laws of physics.
Let's say a worker uses such a clamp and the device registers a magnetic field of 0.02 T.
The clamp is 0.05 m from the wire.
What is the electrical current in the wire?
