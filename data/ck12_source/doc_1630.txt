Glucose , the food of plants, can be used to store energy in the form of large carbohydrate molecules.
Glucose is a simple sugar molecule which can be combined with other glucose molecules to form large carbohydrates, such as starch.
Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis.
It is released into the atmosphere through the stomata.
As you know, animals need oxygen to live.
Without photosynthetic organisms like plants, there would not be enough oxygen in the atmosphere for animals to survive.
The Chemical Reaction
The overall chemical reaction for photosynthesis is 6 molecules of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and 6 molecules of water (H 2 O), with the addition of solar energy.
This produces 1 molecule of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and 6 molecules of oxygen (O 2 ).
Using chemical symbols, the equation is represented as follows: 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O â†’ C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 .
Though this equation may not seem that complicated, photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions divided into two stages, the light reactions and the Calvin cycle ( Figure below ).
The Light Reactions
Photosynthesis begins with the light reactions.
It is during these reactions that the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast.
The energy is then temporarily transferred to two molecules, ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second stage of photosynthesis.
ATP and NADPH are generated by two electron transport chains .
During the light reactions, water is used and oxygen is produced.
These reactions can only occur during daylight as the process needs sunlight to begin.
The Calvin Cycle
The second stage of photosynthesis is the production of glucose from carbon dioxide.
