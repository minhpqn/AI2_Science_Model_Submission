The International Space Station and other space stations orbit Earth in this layer.
Temperature in the Thermosphere
Temperature increases with altitude in the thermosphere.
Surprisingly, it may be higher than 1000° C (1800° F) near the top of this layer!
The Sun’s energy there is very strong.
The molecules absorb the Sun’s energy and are heated up.
But there are so few gas molecules that the air still feels very cold.
Molecules in the thermosphere gain or lose electrons.
They then become charged particles called ions.
Earth's magnetosphere is controlled by the magnetic field.
The magnetosphere protects the planet from the solar wind .
The solar wind is ions that fly from the Sun to Earth very fast.
The magnetosphere protects Earth's ozone layer.
So life on Earth needs the protection of the magnetosphere.
Northern and Southern Lights
Have you ever seen a brilliant light show in the night sky?
Sometimes the ions in the thermosphere glow at night.
Storms on the Sun energize the ions and make them light up.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the lights are called the northern lights, or aurora borealis.
In the Southern Hemisphere, they are called southern lights, or aurora australis.
