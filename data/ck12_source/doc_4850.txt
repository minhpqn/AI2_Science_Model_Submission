His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope.
Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker.
Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoekâ€™s time.
Fortunately, Leeuwenhoek took great care in writing detailed reports of what he saw under his microscope.
He was the first person to report observations of many microscopic organisms.
Some of his discoveries included tiny animals such as ciliates, foraminifera, roundworms, and rotifers, shown in Figure below .
He discovered blood cells and was the first person to see living sperm cells.
In 1683, Leeuwenhoek wrote to the Royal Society of London about his observations on the plaque between his own teeth, "a little white matter, which is as thick as if 'twere batter." He called the creatures he saw in the plaque animacules, or tiny animals.
This report was among the first observations on living bacteria ever recorded.
Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).
His carefully crafted microscopes and insightful observations of microbes led to the title the "Father of Microscopy."
A rotifer, the microscopic organism Leeuwenhoek saw under his microscope.
