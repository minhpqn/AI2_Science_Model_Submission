The proteins and lipids of the membrane move around the membrane, much like buoys in water.
Such movement causes a constant change in the "mosaic pattern" of the plasma membrane.

Extensions of the Plasma Membrane
The plasma membrane may have extensions, such as whip-like flagella or brush-like cilia .
In single-celled organisms, like those shown in Figure below , the membrane extensions may help the organisms move.
In multicellular organisms, the extensions have other functions.
For example, the cilia on human lung cells sweep foreign particles and mucus toward the mouth and nose.
Flagella and cilia in the plasma membrane
Flagella and Cilia.
Cilia and flagella are extensions of the plasma membrane of many cells.
The plasma membrane has many proteins that assist other substances in crossing the membrane.
The Fluid Mosaic Model depicts the biological nature of the plasma membrane.
