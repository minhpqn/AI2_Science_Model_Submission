They are the most common of the four major types of organic compounds.
There are thousands of different carbohydrates, but they all consist of one or more smaller units called monosaccharides.
Monosaccharides and Disaccharides
The general formula for a monosaccharide is (CH 2 O) n , where n can be any number greater than two.
For example, if n is 6, then the formula can be written C 6 H 12 O 6 .
This is the formula for the monosaccharide glucose.
Another monosaccharide, fructose, has the same chemical formula as glucose, but the atoms are arranged differently.
Molecules with the same chemical formula but with atoms in a different arrangement are called isomers .
Compare the glucose and fructose molecules in Figure below .
Can you identify their differences?
The only differences are the positions of some of the atoms.
These differences affect the properties of the two monosaccharides.
Monosaccharides can be classified by the number of carbon atoms they contain: diose (2), triose (3), tetrose (4), pentose (5), hexose (6), heptose (7), and so on.
In addition to glucose, other common monosaccharides include fructose ("fruit sugar"), galactose, xylose ("wood sugar") and ribose (in RNA) and deoxyribose (in DNA).
If two monosaccharides bond together, they form a carbohydrate called a disaccharide .
Two monosaccharides will bond together through a dehydration reaction, in which a water molecule is lost.
A dehydration reaction is a condensation reaction , a chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form one single molecule, losing a small molecule in the process.
In the dehydration reaction, this small molecule is water.
The bond between two monosaccharides is known as a glycosidic bond .
An example of a disaccharide is sucrose (table sugar), which consists of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose ( Figure below ).
