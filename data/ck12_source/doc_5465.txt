DNA engineered through the combination of two or more DNA strands; combines DNA sequences which would not normally occur together.
restriction endonuclease :
An enzyme that cuts double-stranded DNA; also known as a restriction enzyme.
restriction enzyme :
An enzyme that cuts double-stranded DNA; also known as a restriction endonuclease.
restriction site :
DNA sequence recognized and digested by a restriction enzyme.
transfection :
The insertion of foreign DNA into a host cell.
transformation :
The change in genotype and phenotype of a cell/organism due to the assimilation of external DNA (heredity material) by a cell.
Gene cloning, also known as molecular cloning, refers to the process of isolating a DNA sequence of interest for the purpose of making multiple copies of it.
Classic gene cloning involves the following steps:
Restriction enzyme digestion and ligation.
Isolation of DNA.
Transfection and Selection.
