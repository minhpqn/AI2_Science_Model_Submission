Can you think of an organism with a diploid life cycle? ( Hint:
What type of life cycle do humans have?)
Alternation of Generations
Plants, algae, and some protists have a life cycle that alternates between diploid and haploid phases, known as alternation of generations .
In plants, the life cycle alternates between the diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte.
Spore forming cells in the diploid sporophyte undergo meiosis to produce spores , a haploid reproductive cell.
Spores can develop into an adult without fusing with another cell.
The spores give rise to a multicellular haploid gametophyte , which produce gametes by mitosis.
The gametes fuse, producing a diploid zygote, which grow into the diploid sporophyte.
These life cycles may be quite complicated.
You can read about them in additional concepts.
A life cycle is the sequence of stages an organisms goes through from one generation to the next.
Organisms that reproduce sexually can have different types of life cycles, such as haploid or diploid life cycles.
