Saltwater Fish vs.
Freshwater Fish?
Fish cells, like all cells, have semi-permeable membranes.
Eventually, the concentration of "stuff" on either side of them will even out.
A fish that lives in salt water will have somewhat salty water inside itself.
Put it in the freshwater, and the freshwater will, through osmosis, enter the fish, causing its cells to swell, and the fish will die.
What will happen to a freshwater fish in the ocean?
Imagine you have a cup that has 100ml water, and you add 15g of table sugar to the water.
The sugar dissolves and the mixture that is now in the cup is made up of a solute (the sugar) that is dissolved in the solvent (the water).
