Together, there are over 64 trillion unique combinations, not counting the additional variation produced by crossing-over during prophase I.
In other words, each human couple could produce a child with over 64 trillion unique chromosome combinations!
Mitosis vs.
Meiosis
Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division, with dramatically different products.
Mitosis begins with a diploid somatic cell and ends with two genetically identical diploid cells.
Meiosis begins with a diploid cell and produces four haploid genetically unique cells that form gametes.

Mitosis produces two diploid daughter cells, genetically identical to the parent cell.
Meiosis produces four haploid daughter cells, each genetically unique.
