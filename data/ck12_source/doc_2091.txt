These fluids can get into the groundwater.
They may runoff into streams and other surface waters.
There they can cause problems.
The liquid waste injected into the deep wells may cause earthquakes.
Locations where seismic activity is unknown have begun to experience earthquakes.
Is fracking related to earthquake activity?
Many geologists think the link is undeniable.
Natural gas forms with crude oil but at higher temperatures.
Natural gas burns more cleanly than petroleum and produces fewer greenhouse gases.
Hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, is a relatively new method for extracting natural gas.
Fracking may be linked to groundwater contamination and small earthquakes in non-seismic regions.
