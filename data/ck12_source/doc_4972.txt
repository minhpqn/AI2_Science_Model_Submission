The ligands that bind to these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors, hormones, and neurotransmitters.
The ligands for G-protein linked receptors come in different sizes, from small molecules to large proteins.
When a ligand binds to the receptor, it causes a conformational change in the receptor, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.
The receptor can then activate an associated G-protein by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP.
The G-protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins.
Many times the activated G-protein-linked receptor will then activate cyclic AMP (cAMP) , which acts as the second messenger in initiating a cascade of reactions.
The process of how a G-protein linked receptor works is outlined in Figure below .
How a G-protein linked receptor works with the help of a G-protein.
In panel C, the second messenger cAMP can be seen moving away from the enzyme.
G-Protein Linked Receptors
A ligand such as a hormone (small, purple molecule) binds to the G protein-linked receptor (red molecule).
Before ligand binding, the inactive G-protein (yellow molecule) has GDP bound to it.
The receptor changes shape and activates the G-protein and a molecule of GTP replaces the GDP.
The G-protein moves across the membrane then binds to and activates the enzyme (green molecule).
This then triggers the next step in the pathway to the cell's response.
After activating the enzyme, the G-protein returns to its original position.
The second messenger of this signal transduction is cAMP, as shown in C.
The sensing of the external and internal environments at the cellular level relies on signal transduction.
Defects in signal transduction pathways can contribute or lead to many diseases, including cancer and heart disease.
This highlights the importance of signal transductions to biology and medicine.
