Two main types of neurons are sensory neurons and motor neurons.
Sensory neurons carry nerve impulses from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system.
Motor neurons carry nerve impulses from the central nervous system to organs, glands, and musclesâ€”the opposite direction.
Both types of neurons work together.
Sensory neurons carry information about the environment found inside or outside of the body to the central nervous system.
The central nervous system uses the information to send messages through motor neurons to tell the body how to respond to the information.
The place where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another is called a synapse .
Synapses are also found between neurons and other types of cells, such as muscle cells.
The axon of the sending neuron does not actually touch the dendrite of the receiving neuron.
There is a tiny gap between them, the synaptic cleft ( Figure below ).
At a synapse, neurotransmitters are released to carry a nerve impulse from one neuron to the next
This diagram shows a synapse between neurons.
When a nerve impulse arrives at the end of the axon, neurotransmitters are released and travel to the dendrite of another neuron, carrying the nerve impulse from one neuron to the next.
The following steps describe what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon.
When a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon, the axon releases chemicals called neurotransmitters .
Neurotransmitters travel across the synapse between the axon and the dendrite of the next neuron.
Neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite.
The binding allows the nerve impulse to travel through the receiving neuron.
Did you ever watch a relay race?
After the first runner races, he or she passes the baton to the next runner, who takes over.
