Multiplying both sides of the equation by 30x  yields 3x + 30 = 2x and x = -30.0 \ cm .
The negative image distance indicates that the image is behind the mirror.
We know the image is virtual because it is behind the mirror.
Since the image is 3 times as far from the mirror as the object, it will be 3 times as tall.
Therefore, the image height is 3.00 cm.
A spherical mirror is concave if the center of the mirror is further from the viewer than the edges.
For an object that is infinitely far away, incoming rays would be exactly parallel.
As long as the section of mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature, all the reflected rays will pass through a common point, called the focal point.
The distance along the principle axis from the mirror to the focal point is called the focal length, f.
This is also exactly one-half of the radius of curvature.
The mirror equation is \frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f} .
The magnification equation is m=-\frac{d_i}{d_o} .
For concave mirrors, when the object is outside C , the image will be between C  and F  and the image will be inverted and diminished (smaller than the object).
For concave mirrors, when the object is between C  and F , the image will be beyond C  and will be enlarged and inverted.
For concave mirrors, when the object is between F  and the mirror, the image will be behind the mirror and will be enlarged and upright.

A concave mirror is designed so that a person 20.0 cm in front of the mirror sees an upright image magnified by a factor of two.
What is the radius of curvature of this mirror?
If you have a concave mirror whose focal length is 100.0 cm, and you want an image that is upright and 10.0 times as tall as the object, where should you place the object?
A concave mirror has a radius of curvature of 20.0 cm.
