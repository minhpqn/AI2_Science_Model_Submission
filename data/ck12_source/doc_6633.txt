A crow that has habituated to a scarecrow
This scarecrow is no longer scary to this crow.
The crow has become used to its being in this spot and learned that it is not dangerous.
This is an example of habituation.
Can you see why habituation is useful?
It lets animals ignore things that will not harm them.
Without habituation, animals might waste time and energy trying to escape from things that are not really dangerous.
Observational learning is learning by watching and copying the behavior of someone else.
Human children learn many behaviors this way.
When you were a young child, you may have learned how to tie your shoes by watching your dad tie his shoes.
More recently, you may have learned how to dance by watching a pop star dancing on TV.
Most likely, you have learned how to do math problems by watching your teachers do problems on the board at school.
Can you think of other behaviors you have learned by watching and copying other people?
Other animals also learn through observational learning.
For example, young wolves learn to be better hunters by watching and copying the skills of older wolves in their pack.
Another example of observational learning is how some monkeys have learned to wash their food.
They learned by watching and copying the behavior of other monkeys.
Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward or punishment.
Did you ever train a dog to fetch a ball or stick by rewarding it with treats?
