Light slows down and bends when it passes from the water in the glass to the air on its way to your eyes.
Light always travels at the same speed through empty space.
That speed, represented by the letter c, is about 300 million meters per second.
However, when light travels through a medium, it travels more slowly.
If light passes from one medium to another at an angle other than 90 Â°, the light changes speed and bends.
This bending of light is called refraction.
The angle at which light refracts when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed.
The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is.
