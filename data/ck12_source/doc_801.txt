Every species has a population.
Or many populations.
This group of penguins, which are all members of the same species and all living together in the same space, is a population.
What is a Population
A population is a group of organisms of the same species, all living in the same area and interacting with each other.
Since they live together in one area, members of the same species reproduce together.
Ecologists who study populations determine how healthy or stable the populations are.
They also study how the individuals of a species interact with each other and how populations interact with the environment.
If a group of similar organisms in the same area cannot reproduce with members of the other group, then they are members of two distinct species and form two populations.
Ecologists look at many factors that help to describe a population.
First, ecologists can measure the number of individuals that make up the population, known as population size .
They can then determine the population density , which is the number of individuals of the same species in an area.
Population density can be expressed as number per area , such as 20 mice/acre, or 50 rabbits/square mile.
Ecologists also study how individuals in a population are spread across an environment.
This spacing of individuals within a population is called dispersion .
Some species may be clumped or clustered ( Figure below ) in an area.
Others may be evenly spaced ( Figure below ).
Still others may be spaced randomly within an area.
The population density and dispersion have an effect on reproduction and population size.
What do you think the relationship is between population density, dispersion and size?
