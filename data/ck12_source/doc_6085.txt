At room temperature and standard pressure, the average distance between gas molecules is about ten times the diameter of the molecules themselves.
When a gas is compressed, as when the scuba tank is being filled, the gas particles are forced closer together.
Compressed gases are used in many situations.
In hospitals, oxygen is often used for patients who have damaged lungs to help them breathe better.
If a patient is having a major operation, the anesthesia that is administered will frequently be a compressed gas.
Welding requires very hot flames produced by compresses acetylene and oxygen mixtures.
Many summer barbeque grills are fueled by compressed propane.
Compressed gases such as oxygen are used for a wide variety of applications
Gases will compress more easily that solids or liquids because here is so much space between the gas molecules.
