Green light has a higher frequency than microwaves.
It is possible to calculate it, but since the speed of an electromagnetic wave is constant we know that waves with higher wavelengths must have a lower frequency based on the wave equation.
Calculate the frequency for an ultraviolet wave of wavelength 10^{-7}\;\text{m} and compare it to the frequency of a radio wave (about 3*10^9\;\text{Hz} ).
Which type of wave do you think takes more energy to generate?
We'll use the wave equation to determine the wave length of ultraviolet light.
The oscillating charged particles that create UV light are vibrating much more violently than the ones that create radio waves so they take more energy to generate.

Which corresponds to light of longer wavelength, UV rays or IR rays?
Which corresponds to light of lower frequency, x- rays or millimeter-wavelength light?
Approximately how many blue wavelengths would fit end-to-end within a space of one millimeter?
Approximately how many short (“hard”) x- rays would fit end-to-end within the space of a single red wavelength?
Calculate the frequency in Hz of a typical green photon emitted by the Sun.
What is the physical interpretation of this (very high) frequency? (That is, what is oscillating?)
FM radio stations list the frequency of the light they are emitting in MHz, or millions of cycles per second.
For instance, 90.3 \;\mathrm{FM} would operate at a frequency of 90.3 \times 10^6 \;\mathrm{Hz} .
What is the wavelength of the radio-frequency light emitted by this radio station?
Compare this length to the size of your car’s antenna, and make an argument as to why the length of a car’s antenna should be about the wavelength of the light you are receiving.
