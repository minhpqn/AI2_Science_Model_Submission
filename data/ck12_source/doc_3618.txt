This is followed by fertilization and the formation of a diploid zygote.
The number of chromosomes in a gamete is represented by the letter n.
Why does the zygote have 2n, or twice as many, chromosomes?
Asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent.
Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces offspring that are genetically unique.
During sexual reproduction, two haploid gametes join in the process of fertilization to produce a diploid zygote.
Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes.
