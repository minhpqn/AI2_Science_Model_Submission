reduced activity of a protein needed for blood clotting

Few genetic disorders are controlled by dominant alleles.
A mutant dominant allele is expressed in every individual who inherits even one copy of it.
If it causes a serious disorder, affected people may die young and fail to reproduce.
Therefore, the mutant dominant allele is likely to die out of the population.
A mutant recessive allele, such as the allele that causes sickle cell anemia (see Figure below and the link that follows), is not expressed in people who inherit just one copy of it.
These people are called carriers .
They do not have the disorder themselves, but they carry the mutant allele and can pass it to their offspring.
Thus, the allele is likely to pass on to the next generation rather than die out.
Sickle cell anemia and normal red blood cells
Sickle-Shaped and Normal Red Blood Cells.
Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder.
The mutation that causes the disorder affects just one amino acid in a single protein, but it has serious consequences for the affected person.
This photo shows the sickle shape of red blood cells in people with sickle cell anemia.
Cystic Fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease are two additional severe genetic disorders.
They are discussed in the following video: (9:31).
Tay-Sachs is further discussed at  (3:13) and  (2:01).
Mistakes may occur during meiosis that result in nondisjunction .
This is the failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during meiosis (the animation at the link below shows how this happens).
