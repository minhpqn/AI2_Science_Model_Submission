These parts of Dalton’s atomic theory are still accepted today, although some other details of his theory have since been disproven.
Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence.
For example, he studied many substances called compounds.
These are substances that consist of two or more different elements.
Dalton determined that a given compound always consists of the same elements in exactly the same proportions, no matter how small the sample of the compound.
This idea is illustrated for the compound water in the Figure below .
Dalton concluded from this evidence that elements must be made up of tiny particles in order to always combine in the same specific proportions in any given compound.
Structure of water molecule
Water is a compound that consists of the elements hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O).
Like other compounds, the smallest particles of water are called molecules.
Each molecule of water (H 2 O) contains two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Q:
Dalton thought that atoms are the smallest particles of matter.
Scientists now know that atoms are composed of even smaller particles.
Does this mean that the rest of Dalton’s atomic theory should be thrown out?
A:
The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesn’t mean that we should scrap the entire theory.
Atoms are still known to be the smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements.
Also, it is atoms—not particles of atoms—that combine in fixed proportions in compounds.
Instead of throwing out Dalton’s theory, scientists have refined and expanded on it.
