Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the nucleic acid that carries information for nearly all living cells today.
DNA has done this for most of Earth's history.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) delivers genetic instructions to the location in a cell where protein is synthesized.
RNA regulates protein synthesis.
Some scientists think that RNA was the first replicating molecule.
The famous double helix structure of DNA is seen in this animation:
A segment of DNA that is inheritable is a gene .
Every organism has a collection of genes that code for the traits that organism could have.
Not all genes are expressed; therefore, knowing all of your genes does not tell you exactly who you are.
An organism's metabolism is the chemical reactions that allow it to live, grow, and reproduce.
Nucleic acids pass genetic information to the next generation.
DNA passes genetic information for living cells.
RNA passes genetic information for protein synthesis.
