The only obvious difference between boys and girls at birth is their reproductive organs.
However, even the reproductive organs start out the same in both sexes.
Development Before Birth
In the first several weeks after fertilization, males and females are essentially the same except for their chromosomes.
Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have an X and a Y chromosome (XY).
Then, during the second month after fertilization, genes on the Y chromosome of males cause the secretion of testosterone.
Testosterone stimulates the reproductive organs to develop into male organs. (Without testosterone, the reproductive organs always develop into female organs.) Although boys have male reproductive organs at birth, the organs are immature and not yet able to produce sperm or secrete testosterone.
Puberty and Its Changes
The reproductive organs grow very slowly during childhood and do not mature until puberty.
Puberty is the period during which humans become sexually mature.
In the U.S., boys generally begin puberty at about age 12 and complete it at about age 18.
What causes puberty to begin?
The hypothalamus in the brain “tells” the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the testes.
The main pituitary hormone involved is luteinizing hormone (LH) .
It stimulates the testes to secrete testosterone.
Testosterone, in turn, promotes protein synthesis and growth.
It brings about most of the physical changes of puberty, some of which are shown in Figure below .
In addition to the changes shown below, during puberty male facial hair begins to grow, the shoulders broaden, and the male voice deepens.
