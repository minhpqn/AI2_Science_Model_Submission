Simple diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein.
Other larger or charged molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein.
Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane.
For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood.
Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream.
Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs.
Passive Transport using Membrane Proteins
Sometimes, molecules cannot move through the cell membrane on their own.
These molecules need special transport proteins to help them move across the membrane, a process known as facilitative diffusion .
These special proteins are called channel proteins or carrier proteins ( Figure below ), and they are attached to the cell membrane.
In fact, they go through the cell membrane, from the inside of the cell to the outside.
Channel proteins provide an open channel or passageway through the cell membrane for molecules to move across.
Many channel proteins allow the diffusion of ions.
Ions are charged atoms.
The charge makes it difficult to cross the cell membrane without assistance.
Channel proteins are specific for the molecule they transport.
For example a sodium ion crosses the membrane through a channel protein specific for sodium ions.
Carrier proteins bind and carry the molecules across the cell membrane.
These proteins bind a molecule on one side of the membrane, change shape as they carry the molecule across the membrane, and deposit the molecule on the other side of the membrane.
Even though a protein is involved in both these methods of transport, neither method requires energy.
