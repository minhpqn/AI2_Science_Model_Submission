What does a red ribbon symbolize?
This red ribbon is a symbol for support of HIV-positive people and those living with AIDS.
As of 2010, an estimated 34 million people are living with HIV worldwide.
HIV Infection and AIDS
HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS.
AIDS stands for "acquired immune deficiency syndrome." It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure.
AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a person is first infected with HIV.
The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines.
The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines.
Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span.
How HIV Spreads
HIV spreads through contact between an infected personâ€™s body fluids and another person's bloodstream or mucus membranes, which are found in the mouth, nose, and genital areas.
Body fluids that may contain HIV are blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk.
The virus can spread through sexual contact or shared drug needles.
It can also spread from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth or breastfeeding.
Saliva can carry the HIV virus, but it won't spread it, unless the saliva gets into the bloodstream.
Other body fluids such as urine and sweat do not contain the virus.
HIV does not spread in any fluid in which the host cells cannot survive.
Some people think they can become infected with HIV by donating blood or receiving donated blood.
This is not true.
