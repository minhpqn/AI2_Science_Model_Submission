One of the earliest was the extinct genus Sinodelphys .
A fossil of this mammal is shown in.
It is a remarkable fossil find.
It represents a nearly complete animal.
Even tufts of hair and imprints of soft tissues were preserved.
Sinodelphys was about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long.
Its limb structure suggests that it was a climbing animal.
It could escape from predators by climbing into trees.
It probably lived on a diet of insects and worms.
Evolution of Placental Mammals
The earliest placental mammals may have evolved about 110 million years ago.
The ancestor of placental mammals may be the extinct genus Eomaia .
Fossils of Eomaia have been found in what is now China.
It was only about 10 centimeters (4 inches) long.
It was a tree climber and probably ate insects and worms.
Eomaia had several traits of placental mammals.
Figure below shows how Eomaia may have looked.
