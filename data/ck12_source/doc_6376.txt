Solve.
\Delta G^\circ&=-RT \ln K_{eq} \\&=-8.314 \ \text{J} / \text{K} \cdot \text{mol}(298 \ \text{K}) \ln (1.4 \times 10^{-8}) \\&=45,000 \ \text{J} / \text{mol} \\&=45 \ \text{kJ} / \text{mol}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The large, positive  \Delta G^\circ indicates that the solid lead(II) iodide is nearly insoluble and so very little of the solid is dissociated at equilibrium.
The relationship between  \Delta G  and  K_{eq} is described.
Calculations involving these two parameters are shown.
Read the material at the link below and answer the following questions:
What is the difference between \Delta G  and \Delta G^\circ ?
At equilibrium, why does the equation between free energy and equilibrium constant reduce to \Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K_{eq} ?
What other equilibrium units could we use?
When  K_{eq} is large, what will be the sign of \Delta G  ?
When  K_{eq} is small, are reactants or products favored?
What does  R stand for?
