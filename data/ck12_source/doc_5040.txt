Thus chloroplasts, with their orderly arrangement of pigments, enzymes, and electron transport chains, transform light energy into chemical energy.
The first stage of photosynthesis – light-dependent reactions or simply “light reactions” – is complete.

ATP synthase :
Ion channel and enzyme complex; chemically bonds a phosphate group to ADP, producing ATP as H + ions flow through the ion channel.
chemiosmotic gradient :
H + difference across a membrane; established by the active transport of hydrogen ions by an electron transport chain.
electrochemical gradient :
Difference across a membrane due to both a chemical force and an electrical force; drives the movement of ions across the membrane.
electron carrier :
Molecules that accept and temporarily hold high-energy electrons.
electron transport chain :
Series of electron-transport molecules that pass high-energy electrons from molecule to molecule and capture their energy.
light-dependent reactions :
First stage of photosynthesis in which light energy from the sun is captured and transformed into chemical energy; also known as the light reactions.
photolysis :
The splitting of a water molecule to replace electrons used during the light reactions; splitting by light.
Light Reactions transform energy from sunlight into chemical energy, and produce and release oxygen gas.
