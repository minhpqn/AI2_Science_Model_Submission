The Sun is more than 500 times the mass of everything else in the solar system combined!
Listed below is data on the sizes of the Sun and planets relative to Earth ( Table below ).

Distances in the Solar System
Distances in the solar system are often measured in astronomical units (AU).
One astronomical unit is defined as the distance from Earth to the Sun. 1 AU equals about 150 million km (93 million miles).
Listed below is the distance from the Sun to each planet in AU ( Table below ).
The table shows how long it takes each planet to spin once on its axis.
It also shows how long it takes each planet to complete an orbit.
Notice how slowly Venus rotates!
A day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus!

The Size and Shape of Orbits
Figure below shows the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets, asteroid belt, and Kuiper belt.
In general, the farther away from the Sun, the greater the distance from one planetâ€™s orbit to the next.
The orbits of the planets are not circular but slightly elliptical ( Figure below ).
