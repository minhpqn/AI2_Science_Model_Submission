For example, an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves.
Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper.
Next, a bird might prey on the grasshopper, a snake may eat the bird, and then an owl might eat the snake.
The food chain would be:
plant → grasshopper → bird → snake → owl.
A food chain cannot continue to go on and on.
For example the food chain could not be:
plant → grasshopper → spider → frog → lizard → fox → hawk.
Food chains only have 4 or 5 total levels.
Therefore, a chain has only 3 or 4 levels for energy transfer.
This food chain includes both producers and consumers, but not decomposers
This food chain includes producers and consumers.
How could you add decomposers to the food chain?
In an ocean ecosystem, one possible food chain might look like this: phytoplankton → krill → fish → shark.
The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain, bringing energy into the ecosystem.
Through photosynthesis, the producers create their own food in the form of glucose, but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem.
The herbivores come next, then the carnivores .
When these consumers eat other organisms, they use the glucose in those organisms for energy.
In this example, phytoplankton are eaten by krill, which are tiny, shrimp-like animals.
The krill are eaten by fish, which are then eaten by sharks.
