There are a couple of odd little practices with the use of metric abbreviations.
Most abbreviations are lower-case.
We use “m” for meter and not “M”.
However, when it comes to volume, the base unit “liter” is abbreviated as “L” and not “l”.
So we would write 3.5 milliliters as 3.5 mL.
As a practical matter, whenever possible you should express the units in a small and manageable number.
If you are measuring the weight of a material that weighs 6.5 kg, this is easier than saying it weighs 6500 g or 0.65 dag.
All three are correct, but the kg units in this case make for a small and easily managed number.
However, if a specific problem needs grams instead of kilograms, go with the grams for consistency.
Metric prefixes derive from Latin or Greek terms.
The prefixes are used to make the units manageable.
