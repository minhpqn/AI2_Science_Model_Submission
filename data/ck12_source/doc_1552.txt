Some of this heat is absorbed by gases in the atmosphere.
This is the greenhouse effect , and it helps to keep Earth warm.
The greenhouse effect allows Earth to have temperatures that can support life.
Gases that absorb heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases .
They include carbon dioxide and water vapor.
Human actions have increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ( Figure below ).
The added gases have caused a greater greenhouse effect.
How do you think this affects Earth’s temperature?
Diagram of the natural and human enhanced greenhouse effect
Human actions have increased the natural greenhouse effect.
Like a blanket on a sleeping person, greenhouse gases act as insulation for the planet.
The warming of the atmosphere is because of insulation by greenhouse gases.
Greenhouse gases are the component of the atmosphere that moderate Earth’s temperatures.
Greenhouse gases include CO 2 , H 2 O, methane, O 3 , nitrous oxides (NO and NO 2 ), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
All are a normal part of the atmosphere except CFCs.
The table below shows how each greenhouse gas naturally enters the atmosphere ( Table below ).
Respiration, volcanic eruptions, decomposition of plant material; burning of fossil fuels
Decomposition of plant material under some conditions, biochemical reactions in stomachs
Produced by bacteria
Not naturally occurring; made by humans
