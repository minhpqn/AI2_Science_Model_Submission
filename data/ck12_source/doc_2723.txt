How does this affect the reaction rate along each pathway?
A:
The catalytic pathway of the reaction requires far less energy.
Therefore, the reaction will occur faster by this pathway because more reactants will have enough energy to react.
Catalysts in Living Things
Chemical reactions constantly occur inside living things.
Many of these reactions require catalysts so they will occur quickly enough to support life.
Catalysts in living things are called enzymes.
Enzymes may be extremely effective.
A reaction that takes a split second to occur with an enzyme might take many years without it!
More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life.
Many enzymes are needed for the digestion of food.
An example is amylase, which is found in the mouth and small intestine.
Amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch to sugar.
You can see how it affects the rate of starch digestion in the Figure below .
Q:
If you chew a starchy food such as a soda cracker for a couple of minutes, you may notice that it starts to taste slightly sweet.
Why does this happen?
A:
The starches in the cracker start to break down to sugars with the help of the enzyme amylase.
