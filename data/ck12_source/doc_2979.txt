Why Friction Occurs
Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth.
Even surfaces that look smooth to the unaided eye make look rough or bumpy when viewed under a microscope.
Look at the metal surfaces in the Figure below .
The aluminum foil is so smooth that it’s shiny.
However, when highly magnified, the surface of metal appears to be very bumpy.
All those mountains and valleys catch and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts the metal.
This creates friction.
Even smooth-looking surfaces like aluminum foil are very bumpy
Factors That Affect Friction
Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces.
That’s why we put sand on icy sidewalks and roads.
You can’t slide as far across ice with shoes as you can on the blades of skates (see Figure below ).
The rougher surface of the soles of the shoes causes more friction and slows you down.
Ice skates help reduce friction
