Describe the appearance of a solution.
Describe the appearance of a suspension.
Is a suspension a heterogeneous or a homogeneous mixture?
How can the solid material in a suspension be separated from the liquid?
Which part of milk is in suspension?
dispersion medium:  The material in which the particles are distributed.
suspension:  A heterogeneous mixture in which some of the particles settle out of the mixture upon standing.
turbid:
Unclear, thick, or cloudy.
List differences between colloids, solutions, and suspensions.
Give examples of colloids.
Smoke flares take advantage of a form of mixture called a colloid
What type of mixture is a smoke flare?
Imagine you are sailing on a yacht.
The engine suddenly breaks down and you are stranded in the middle of the ocean.
You call the Coast Guard on your radio, but cannot give them an exact location because your GPS isnâ€™t working.
Fortunately, you have a smoke flare, which you fire off.
The dense colored smoke shows the Coast Guard where you are so they can rescue you.
In using the flare, you are taking advantage of a type of mixture called a colloid.
A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture whose particle size is intermediate between those of a solution and a suspension.  The dispersed particles are spread evenly throughout the dispersion medium , which can be a solid, liquid, or gas.  Because the dispersed particles of a colloid are not as large as those of a suspension, they do not settle out upon standing.  The Table below summarizes the properties and distinctions between solutions, colloids, and suspensions.
