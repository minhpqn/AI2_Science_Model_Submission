In one way, metals are like willow trees.
They can bend without breaking.
That’s because metals form special bonds called metallic bonds.
What Are Metallic Bonds?
Metallic bonds are forces of attraction between positive metal ions and the valence electrons that are constantly moving around them (see the Figure below ).
The valence electrons include their own and those of other, nearby ions of the same metal.
The valence electrons of metals move freely in this way because metals have relatively low electronegativity, or attraction to electrons.
The positive metal ions form a lattice-like structure held together by all the metallic bonds.

Q:
Why do metallic bonds form only in elements that are metals?
Why don’t similar bonds form in elements that are nonmetals?
A:
Metal atoms readily give up valence electrons and become positive ions whenever they form bonds.
When nonmetals bond together, the atoms share valence electrons and do not become ions.
For example, when oxygen atoms bond together they form oxygen molecules in which two oxygen atoms share two pairs of valence electrons equally, so neither atom becomes charged.
Metallic Bonds and the Properties of Metals
The valence electrons surrounding metal ions are constantly moving.
