An SI prefix is a name or symbol that is put before a unit of measure (or its symbol) to form a decimal or a multiple of the unit.
For example, kilo - is a multiple of a thousand and milli - is a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimeters in a meter, and one thousand meters in a kilometer .
All prefixes are multiples of 10, as you can see from the SI Prefixes Table below .
The prefixes are never combined; a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram not a microkilogram .
Factor of 10
