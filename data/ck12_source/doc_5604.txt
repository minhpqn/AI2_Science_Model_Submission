How many liters of solution should he prepare?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
1 exp requires 120 mL
1 L = 1000 mL
L of solution for 40 exp
Since each experiment requires 120 ml of solution and the teacher needs to prepare enough for 40 experiments, multiply 120 by 40 to get 4800 mL of solution needed.
Now you must convert ml to L by using a conversion factor.
Step 2:
Calculate
4800 \ \text{mL} \times \frac{1 \ \text{L}}{1000 \ \text{mL}}=4.8 \ \text{L}
Note that conversion factor is arranged so that the mL unit is in the denominator and thus cancels out, leaving L as the remaining unit in the answer.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
A liter is much larger than a milliliter, so it makes sense that the number of liters required is less than the number of milliliters.
Two-Step Metric Unit Conversions
Some metric conversion problems are most easily solved by breaking them down into more than one step.
When both the given unit and the desired unit have prefixes, one can first convert to the simple (unprefixed) unit, followed by a conversion to the desired unit.
An example will illustrate this method.
