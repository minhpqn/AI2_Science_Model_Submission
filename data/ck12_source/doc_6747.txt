Draw vectors representing the astronaut’s velocity and acceleration.
Draw a free body diagram for the astronaut.
Is the astronaut exerting a force on the space station?
If so, calculate its magnitude.
Her mass m=65\;\mathrm{kg} .
The astronaut drops a ball, which appears to accelerate to the ‘floor,’ (see picture) at 9.8 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2.
Draw the velocity and acceleration vectors for the ball while it is in the air.
What force(s) are acting on the ball while it is in the air?
Draw the acceleration and velocity vectors after the ball hits the floor and comes to rest.
What force(s) act on the ball after it hits the ground?
Answers to Selected Problems
a. 4.23 \times 10^7\mathrm{m} b. 6.6 \ R_e d.
The same, the radius is independent of mass
1.9 \times 10^7\mathrm{m}
You get two answers for r , one is outside of the two stars one is between them, that’s the one you want, 1.32 \times 10^{10}\mathrm{m} from the larger star.
a. v = 28\;\mathrm{m/s} b. v- down, a- right c. f- right d.
Yes, 640\mathrm{N}
In this chapter students will learn about the Universal Law of Gravity and how to solve gravitational problems in space.
