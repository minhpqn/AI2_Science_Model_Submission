Several lethal viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever have been discovered, two of which are shown in the Figure below .
Ebola outbreaks have been limited mainly to remote areas of the world.
However, they have gained extensive media attention because of the high mortality rate—23 percent to 90 percent—depending on the strain.
The primary hosts of the viruses are thought to be apes in west central Africa, but the virus has also been isolated from bats in the same region.
Both the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus can cause dangerous hemorrhagic fevers
The Ebola virus (left), and Marburg virus (right), are viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers that can cause multiple organ failure and death.
People get exposed to new and rare zoonoses when they move into new areas and encounter wild animals.
For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) is a respiratory disease which is caused by the SARS coronavirus.
An outbreak in China in 2003 was linked to the handling and consumption of wild civet cats sold as food in a market.
In 2005, two studies identified a number of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese bats.
It is likely that the virus spread from bats to civets, and then to humans.
Ebola is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with a strain of Ebola virus.
The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history, affecting multiple countries in West Africa, including Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
Ebola is spread through direct contact with blood and body fluids of a person infected by and already showing symptoms of Ebola.
Ebola is not spread through the air, water, food, or mosquitoes.

Viruses cause many human diseases by killing host cells or disturbing their homeostasis.
Viruses are not affected by antibiotics.
Several viral diseases can be treated with antiviral drugs or prevented with vaccines.
