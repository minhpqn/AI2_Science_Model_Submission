Using Chemical Symbols and Formulas
When scientists write chemical equations, they use chemical symbols and chemical formulas instead of names to represent reactants and products.
Look at the chemical reaction illustrated in the Figure below .
In this reaction, carbon reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide.
Carbon is represented by the chemical symbol C.
The chemical symbol for oxygen is O, but pure oxygen exists as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules, represented by the chemical formula O 2 .
A molecule of the compound carbon dioxide consists of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen, so carbon dioxide is represented by the chemical formula CO 2 .
Carbon and oxygen combine to form carbon dioxide
Q:
What is the chemical equation for this reaction?
A:
The chemical equation is:
C + O 2 → CO 2
Q:
How have the atoms of the reactants been rearranged in the products of the reaction?
What bonds have been broken, and what new bonds have formed?
A:
Bonds between the oxygen atoms in the oxygen molecule have been broken, and new bonds have formed between the carbon atom and the two oxygen atoms.
Is It Balanced?
All chemical equations, like equations in math, must balance.
