Ionic and Covalent Solutes
All solutes separate into individual particles when they dissolve, but the particles are different for ionic and covalent compounds.
Ionic solutes separate into individual ions.
Covalent solutes separate into individual molecules.
Salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is an ionic compound.
When it dissolves in water, it separates into positive sodium ions (Na + ) and negative chloride ions (Cl - ).
You can see how this happens in the Figure below .
The negative oxygen ends of water molecules attract the positive sodium ions, and the positive hydrogen ends of water molecules attract the negative chloride ions.
These forces of attraction pull the ions apart.

Diagram showing how salt dissolves in water
The sugar glucose is a covalent compound.
When sugar dissolves in water, it forms individual glucose molecules (C 6 H 12 O 6 ).
You can see how this happens in the Figure below .
Sugar is polar like water, so sugar molecules also have positive and negative ends.
Forces of attraction between oppositely charged ends of water and sugar molecules pull individual sugar molecules away from the sugar crystal.
Little by little, the sugar molecules are separated from the crystal and surrounded by water.
