Salamanders belong to a group of approximately 500 species of amphibians.
The order Urodela, containing salamanders and newts, is divided into three suborders:
Giant salamanders, including the hellbender and Asiatic salamanders.
Advanced salamanders, including lungless salamanders, mudpuppies, and newts.
Newts are salamanders that spend most of each year living on land.
Sirens.
Sirens are salamanders that have lungs as well as gills and never develop beyond the larval stage.
Sirens have only two legs, but the other salamander species develop four legs as adults, with fleshy toes at the end of each foot.
The legs on four-legged salamanders are so short that the salamander belly drags on the ground as the animal walks.
Sirens have long, strong tails that are flat to help sirens swim like a fish, with the tail swinging from side to side.
Salamanders live in or near water or on moist ground, often in a swamp.
Salamanders can breathe with the help of gills, lungs, or their skin surface.
