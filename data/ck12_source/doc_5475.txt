U.S. government-funded national resource for molecular biology information; part of the United States National Library of Medicine on the NIH campus.
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) :
One of 27 institutes and centers that make up the NIH; devoted to improving human health through human genetics and genomics basic and clinical research.
National Institutes of Health (NIH) :
The United States' medical research agency; supporting scientific studies world-wide; composed of 27 institutes and centers.
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) :
A DNA sequence variation occurring when a single nucleotide differs between members of a species or paired chromosomes in an individual.
The goal of the Human Genome Project is to understand the genetic make-up of the human species by determining the DNA sequence of the human genome and the genome of a few model organisms.
Understanding the human genome will allow research into genes and their corresponding proteins, and genetic diseases.
