You would think that the next toss is more likely to be a tail, but the possibility of tossing another head is still 50%.
If you tossed the coin a total of ten times, a total of seven heads and three tails, you would calculate the probability of tossing heads is 70%.
The fact that you carried out only a small number of trials has affected your results.
If Mendel had grown only 10 plants, he would have gotten different probabilities for the appearance of dominant and recessive traits.
However, Mendel carried out many thousands of trials.
He was therefore sure that his results were due to probability, and not to chance.
Probability and the Law of Segregation
Each coin toss is a separate event.
Likewise, gamete formation is a separate event.
The probability that a Pp heterozygote produces gametes with a P allele or a p allele is 50% for each gamete cell.
In a fertilization involving two such plants (as in the F 1 generation self-pollination experiment), each pollen cell and each egg cell have a 50% chance of having the P or p allele.
Using Probability to Determine Alleles in Gametes
In Mendel's monohybrid cross, two heterozygous plants are crossed.
Both plants produce gametes, all of which contain either a P or p allele for flower color.
The likelihood that any particular gamete contains the allele for a white flower can be calculated.
Because a gamete can only carry one out of two alleles, there are only two possible outcomes for a gamete.
The probability that a gamete will carry the allele for white flower color is ½, 0.5, or 50%.
The probability that a gamete will carry the allele for purple flower color is also ½.
Formation of gametes by meiosis.
Paired alleles always separate and go to different gametes during meiosis.
