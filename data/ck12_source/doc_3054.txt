Describe the unit called the horsepower.
Did you ever sweep a floor with a broom, like the woman in the picture on the left?
It can take a lot of effort to do the job.
But if you use an electric vacuum cleaner, like the woman in the picture on the right, you can do the same work more easily and quickly.
That’s because the vacuum cleaner provides more power.
What Is Power?
Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given amount of time.
Power can be represented by the equation:
In this equation, work is measured in joules (J) and time is measured in seconds (s), so power is expressed in joules per second (J/s).
This is the SI unit for power, also known as the watt (W) .
A watt equals 1 joule of work per second.
You’re probably already familiar with watts.
Light bulbs and small appliances such as microwave ovens are labeled with the watts of power they provide.
For example, the package of light bulbs in the Figure below is labeled “14 watts.”
Q :
Assume you have two light bulbs of the same type, such as two compact fluorescent light bulbs like the one pictured in the Figure above .
If one light bulb is a 25-watt bulb and the other is a 60-watt bulb, which bulb produces brighter light?
A :
The 60-watt bulb is more powerful, so it produces brighter light.
Compared with a less powerful device, a more powerful device can either do more work in the same time or do the same work in less time.
