The same biochemical building blocks, such as amino acids and nucleotides, are found in all organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals.
Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA.
DNA and RNA determine the development of all organisms.
The similarities and differences between the genomes confirm patterns of evolution.
Map of genes on a human chromosome
This is a map of the genes on just one of the 46 human chromosomes.
How does this region of a chromosome compare to similar regions in other species?
Similarities and differences between the genomes (the genetic makeup) of different organisms reveal the relationships between the species.
Molecular clocks are used to determine how closely two species are related by calculating the number of differences between the species' DNA sequences or amino acid sequences.
Molecular evidence for evolution includes that all living things share the same biochemical building blocks.

How is the genetic sequence of an organism like a blueprint of that organism?
If two organisms have almost identical sequences for the same gene, are they considered closely related?
What type of animal have scientists long thought was basal to all other animals?
How has genetic analysis affected this view?
How has genetic analysis become quicker than it once was?
How has that greatly helped with the search for a basal organism?
