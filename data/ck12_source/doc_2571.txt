These are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in interactions with other atoms.
Let’s look at two examples of nonmetals, fluorine and neon.
Simple atomic models of these two elements are shown in the Figure below .
Q:
Which element, fluorine or neon, do you predict is more reactive?
A:
Fluorine is more reactive than neon.
That’s because it has seven of eight possible electrons in its outer energy level, whereas neon already has eight electrons in this energy level.
Fluorine and neon have different numbers of valence electrons
Although neon has just one more electron than fluorine in its outer energy level, that one electron makes a huge difference.
Fluorine needs one more electron to fill its outer energy level in order to have the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Therefore, fluorine readily accepts an electron from any element that is equally “eager” to give one up, such as the metal lithium or sodium.
As a result, fluorine is highly reactive.
In fact, reactions with fluorine are often explosive, as you can see in the URL below.
Neon, on the other hand, already has a full outer energy level.
It is already very stable and never reacts with other elements.
It neither accepts nor gives up electrons.
Neon doesn’t even react with fluorine, which reacts with all other elements except helium.
