P_1 \times V_1=P_2 \times V_2
This equation can be used to calculate any one of the four quantities if the other three are known.
Sample Problem:
Boyle’s Law
A sample of oxygen gas has a volume of 425 mL when the pressure is equal to 387 kPa.
The gas is allowed to expand into a 1.75 L container.
Calculate the new pressure of the gas.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
P_1=387 \ \text{kPa}
V_1=425 \ \text{mL}
V_2=1.75 \ \text{L}=1750 \ \text{mL}
P_2=? \ \text{kPa}
Use Boyle’s Law to solve for the unknown pressure (P_2) .
It is important that the two volumes ( V_1 and V_2 ) are expressed in the same units, so  V_2 has been converted to mL.
Step 2:
Solve.
First, rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for P_2 .
P_2=\frac{P_1 \times V_1}{V_2}
Now substitute the known quantities into the equation and solve.
