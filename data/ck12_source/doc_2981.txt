A :
To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine.
The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery.
They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction.
Matches are lit using friction
Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching.
Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth.
Rougher surfaces have more friction between them.
Heavier objects also have more friction because they press together with greater force.
Friction produces heat because it causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster and have more energy.
Experiment with the effects of friction on the motion of a toy car in the activity at the following URL.
Then take the quiz to see how well you understand friction.
Define friction, and explain why it occurs.
Identify two factors that affect friction.
Why does friction warm your hands when you rub them together?
Outside wooden steps may get slippery when they are wet.
How could you make them less slippery?
Types of Friction
Identify four types of friction.
Compare and contrast static, sliding, and rolling friction.
