Actual yield = 14.9 g
Theoretical yield = 15.7 g (from Part 12.11A)
Percent yield = ? %
\text{Percent Yield}=\frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100 \%
Use the percent yield equation above.
Step 2:
Solve.
\text{Percent Yield}=\frac{14.9 \text{ g}}{15.7 \text{ g}} \times 100=94.9\%
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Since the actual yield is slightly less than the theoretical yield, the percent yield is just under 100%.
Theoretical yield is calculated based on the stoichiometry of the chemical equation.
The actual yield is experimentally determined.
The percent yield is determined by calculating the ratio of actual yield/theoretical yield.
Work the problems found on the link below:
What do we need in order to calculate theoretical yield?
If I spill some of the product before I weigh it, how will that affect the actual yield?
How will spilling some of the product affect the percent yield?
I make a product and weigh it before it is dry.
How will that affect the actual yield?
