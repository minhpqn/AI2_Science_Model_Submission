How can Earth's atmosphere be in constant motion?
Stand outside on a windy day and it's easy to see that Earth is a dynamic planet.
But being dynamic requires energy.
Where does that energy come from?
In the atmosphere, it comes from the Sun.
Solar energy provides the power needed for the atmosphere to move.
Importance of the Atmosphere
Define the atmosphere.
Describe the roles the atmosphere plays on Earth.
Why is the Atmosphere Important?
Why is Earth the only planet in the solar system known to have life?
The main reason is Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
Organisms need the gases in the atmosphere to live.
Water is also essential for life.
Water vapor is one of the gases in the atmosphere.
Green algae, like in this photo, are primitive life.
The atmosphere is a mixture of gases that surrounds the planet.
We also call it air.
The gases in the atmosphere include nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.
Along with water vapor, the atmosphere allows life to survive.
