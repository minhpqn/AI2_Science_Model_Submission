Ecology is the study of ecosystems.
An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat.
Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction.
Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy.
The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area.
The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system.
Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.
