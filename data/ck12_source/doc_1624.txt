The sodium-potassium pump ( Figure below ) is an example of an active transport pump.
The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na + ) ions and two potassium (K + ) ions to where they are already highly concentrated.
Sodium ions move out of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell.
How do these ions then return to their original positions?
As the ions now can flow down their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion returns the ions to their original positions either inside or outside the cell.
Diagram of the sodium-potassium pump
The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions to the outside of the cell and potassium ions to the inside of the cell, areas where these ions are already highly concentrated.
ATP is required for the protein to change shape.
ATP is converted into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) during active transport.
During active transport, a protein pump uses energy, in the form of ATP, to move molecules from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration.
An example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which moves sodium ions to the outside of the cell and potassium ions to the inside of the cell.
