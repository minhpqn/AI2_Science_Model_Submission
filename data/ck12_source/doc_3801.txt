Influences on Darwin
Identify the influences of Lamarck, Lyell and Malthus on Darwin.
Explain artificial selection.
Describe the role of Alfred Russel Wallace in developing the theory of evolution.
How do structures like this form?
Cathedral Rock in Sedona, Arizona.
Though Arizona was not on Darwin's itinerary, the work of others that saw and studied Earth's changing landscape influenced him.
One geologist, Charles Lyell, proposed that gradual geological processes have shaped Earth’s surface, inferring that Earth must be far older than most people believed.
How else could structures like those shown here develop?
If in fact Earth was much older then just 6,000 years, Darwin believed there would have been plenty of time for evolution to occur.
Influences on Darwin
Science, like evolution, always builds on the past.
Darwin didn’t develop his theory completely on his own.
He was influenced by the ideas of earlier thinkers.
Earlier Thinkers Who Influenced Darwin
Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was an important French naturalist.
He was one of the first scientists to propose that species change over time.
However, Lamarck was wrong about how species change.
His idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics is incorrect.
Traits an organism develops during its own life time cannot be passed on to offspring, as Lamarck believed.
