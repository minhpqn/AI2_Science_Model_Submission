Adjusting to Changing Pressure
Scuba divers can dive without special vehicles because they don’t go very deep below the surface of the water.
Nonetheless, because of the pressure of the water, scuba divers who go deeper than about 40 meters must return to the surface slowly.
They must stop for several minutes at one or more points in their ascent.
That’s what the divers in the Figure below are doing.
The stops are needed to let the pressure inside their body adjust to the decreasing pressure of the water as they swim closer to the surface.
If they were to rise to the surface too quickly, the gases dissolved in their blood would form bubbles and cause serious health problems.
Q :
Why would dissolved gases form bubbles as pressure decreases?
A :
Less gas can dissolve in a fluid at lower pressure.
Therefore, as pressure decreases, gases come out of solution and form bubbles.
Scuba divers need to return to the surface slowly
As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases.
For each additional meter below the surface, pressure increases by 10 kPa.
Water pressure makes it difficult to explore the deep ocean.
The pressure is too great for divers unless they travel in pressure-resistant deep-sea vehicles.
Even scuba divers have to take time to adjust to the changes in pressure as they return to the surface.
