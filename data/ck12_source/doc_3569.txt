Like water flowing through a hole in the dam, hydrogen ions “slide down” their concentration gradient through a membrane protein which acts as both ion channel and enzyme.
As they flow, the ion channel/enzyme ATP synthase uses their energy to chemically bond a phosphate group to ADP, making ATP.
(2) Light re-energizes the electrons, and they travel down a second electron transport chain (ETC), eventually bonding hydrogen ions to NADP + to form a more stable energy storage molecule, NADPH .
NADPH is sometimes called “hot hydrogen,” and its energy and hydrogen atoms will be used to help build sugar in the second stage of photosynthesis.
The electron transport chain in photosynthesis
Membrane architecture:
The large colored carrier molecules form electron transport chains which capture small amounts of energy from excited electrons in order to store it in ATP and NADPH.
Follow the energy pathways: light → electrons → NADPH (blue line) and light → electrons → concentrated H + → ATP (red line).
Note the intricate organization of the chloroplast.
NADPH and ATP molecules now store the energy from excited electrons – energy which was originally sunlight – in chemical bonds.
Thus chloroplasts, with their orderly arrangement of pigments, enzymes, and electron transport chains, transform light energy into chemical energy.
The first stage of photosynthesis – light-dependent reactions or simply light reactions – is complete.

The light reactions capture energy from sunlight, which they change to chemical energy that is stored in molecules of NADPH and ATP.
The light reactions also release oxygen gas as a waste product.
