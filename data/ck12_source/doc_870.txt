Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels.
Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity.
The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ).
Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air.
Deforestation creates significant increases in carbon dioxide levels around the world
Deforestation, shown here as a result of burning for agriculture in southern Mexico, has produced significant increases in carbon dioxide emissions over the past 20 years.
This increase in global temperature will cause the sea level to rise.
It is also expected to produce an increase in extreme weather events and change the amount of precipitation.
Global warming may also cause food shortages and species extinction.
Air pollution is caused by chemical substances and particles released into the air, mainly by human activities.
The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels.
Problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels include acid rain and global warming.
