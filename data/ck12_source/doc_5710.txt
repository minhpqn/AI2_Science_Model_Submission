No other ticket can have the same four parts to it.
It may have the same gate, section, and seat number, but it would have to be in a different row.
Each seat is unique and allows only one occupant to fill it.
We use a series of specific numbers, called quantum numbers , to describe the location of an electron in an associated atom.
Quantum numbers specify the properties of the atomic orbitals and the electrons in those orbitals.
An electron in an atom or ion has four quantum numbers to describe its state.
Think of them as important variables in an equation which describes the three-dimensional position of electrons in a given atom.
Principal Quantum Number (n)
The principal quantum number , signified by (n) , is the main energy level occupied by the electron.
Energy levels are fixed distances from the nucleus of a given atom.
They are described in whole number increments (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...).
At location n=1 , an electron would be closest to the nucleus, while  n=2 the electron would be farther, and  n=3 farther yet.
As we will see, the principal quantum number corresponds to the row number for an atom on the periodic table.
Angular Momentum Quantum Number  (l)
The angular momentum quantum number , signified as (l) , describes the general shape or region an electron occupies â€“ its orbital shape.
The value of l depends on the value of the principle quantum number n .
The angular momentum quantum number can have positive values of zero to (n-1) .
If n=2 ,  l could be either 0 or 1.
Magnetic Quantum Number (m_l)
The magnetic quantum number , signified as (m_l) , describes the orbital orientation in space.
