Students measure an unknown resistor and list their results in the Table ( below ); based on their results, complete the following:
Show a circuit diagram with the connections to the power supply, ammeter and voltmeter.
Graph voltage vs. current; find the best-fit straight line.
Use this line to determine the resistance.
How confident can you be of the results?
Use the graph to determine the current if the voltage were 13\;\mathrm{V} .
