Planets of the Solar System
Define astronomical unit.
Describe the solar system's eight planets.
Can humans take a field trip through the solar system?
A field trip through the solar system would take a long time.
It took 12 years for the Voyager spacecraft to get from Earth to Neptune.
If a human was on board, he or she would probably want to come back!
Fortunately, unmanned spacecrafts can send back images of far distant places in the solar system.
Solar System Objects
Astronomers now recognize eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), five dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris), more than 150 moons, and many, many asteroids and other small objects ( Figure below ).
These objects move in regular and predictable paths around the Sun.
The relative sizes of the Sun and planets in the Solar System
Relative sizes of the Sun, planets, and dwarf planets and their positions relative to each other are to scale.
The relative distances are not to scale.
The Sun is just an average star compared to other stars.
But it is by far the largest object in the solar system.
