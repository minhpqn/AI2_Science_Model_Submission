A dark purple flower is crossed with a white flower of the same species, and the offspring have light purple flowers.
What type of inheritance does this describe?
Explain.
What is the inheritance pattern in which both alleles are expressed?
What is the genotype of a person with type O blood?
What is the genotype(s) of a person with type AB blood?
Explain the inheritance of polygenic traits.
Describe the phenotypic distribution of polygenic traits.
Are all people either short or tall?
Unlike Mendel's peas, people do not all fall into two categories: short or tall.
Most people, in fact, are somewhere in between.
Obviously, Mendel's rules are too simple to explain the inheritance of human height.
Another exception to Mendelâ€™s rules is polygenic inheritance , which occurs when a trait is controlled by more than one gene.
This means that each dominant allele "adds" to the expression of the next dominant allele.
Usually, traits are polygenic when there is wide variation in the trait.
For example, humans can be many different sizes.
Height is a polygenic trait, controlled by at least three genes with six alleles.
If you are dominant for all of the alleles for height, then you will be very tall.
There is also a wide range of skin color across people.
Skin color is also a polygenic trait, as are hair and eye color.
