A DNA polymerase named after the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquatics from which it was originally isolated; the heat-stable polymerase used in the PCR reaction.
The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to amplify millions of times specific regions of a DNA strand.
This can be a number of loci, a single gene, a part of a gene, or a non-coding sequence.
PCR usually involves the following steps:
