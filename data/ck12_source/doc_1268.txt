The East African Rift is a rift valley.
Eastern Africa is splitting away from the African continent.
Eventually, as the continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust will form.
This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up.
Divergent plate boundaries in the ocean create mid-ocean ridges.
This is where new seafloor is created by upwelling magma.
Divergent plate boundaries rift a continent apart.
Eventually a new ocean will form between the two continents.
Iceland is a location where we can see a mid-ocean ridge above sea level.
