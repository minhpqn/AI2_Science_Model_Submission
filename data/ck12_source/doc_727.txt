Two objects each carry a charge and they attract.  What do you know about the charge of each object?
They are both charged positively.
They have opposite charged from each other.
They are both charged negatively.
Any of the above are possible.
A material that easily allows the flow of electric charge through it is called a(n)
What is the most common way of acquiring a positive static electrical charge?
by losing electrons
by gain protons
by losing protons
by gaining electrons
by switching positions of electrons and protons in the atom
How does friction generate static electricity?
Friction heats the materials, thus causing electricity.
Rubbing materials together displaces atoms, causing sparks to fly.
Rubbing materials together can strip electrons off atoms, causing one material to become positive and the other to become negative.
Rubbing materials together causes neutrons and electrons to trade places.
None of the above.
