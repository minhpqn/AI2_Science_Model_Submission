The induced current will need to create a magnetic field that is also pointed into the table through the loop to oppose this change in flux.
Again, we use the second right hand rule to find that the current must go in the CW direction.

Generator (PhET Simulation)
How is electrical energy produced in a dam using a hydroelectric generator?
Explain in a short essay involving as many different ideas from physics as you need.
When building a generator why not make it with almost infinite number of wire loops, since the emf is proportional to N the number of loops?
What is the trade off, so to speak.
Explain how a motor works.
Explain in your own words why the generator in example 1 spins the same direction upon discharge.
