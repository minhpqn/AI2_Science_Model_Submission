Therefore, the density of matter can be calculated with this formula:
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}
Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of 1000 cm 3 .
Then the density of the book is:
\text{Density} = \frac{500 \ \text{g}}{1000 \ \text{cm}^3} = 0.5 \ \text{g/cm}^3
Q:
What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a mass of 300 g?
A:
The density of the liquid is:
\text{Density} = \frac{300 \ \text{g}}{30 \ \text{mL}} = 10 \ \text{g/mL}
Density is an important physical property of matter.
It reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are.
The density of matter can be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume.
