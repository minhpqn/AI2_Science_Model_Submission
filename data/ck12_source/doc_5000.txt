Catabolic reactions break down molecules into smaller units.
An example is a decomposition reaction, such as the breakdown of glucose molecules for energy.
Exothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation:
Reactants → Products + Heat.
Chemical reactions that consume energy are called endothermic reactions .
Energy is usually absorbed from the surroundings as heat.
An example is the synthesis of ammonia, described above.
In organisms, endothermic reactions are called anabolic reactions .
Anabolic reactions construct molecules from smaller units.
An example is the synthesis of proteins from amino acids.
Endothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation:
Reactants + Heat → Products.
This pack gets cold due to an endothermic reaction.
In biological systems, the term endothermic is a metabolic term related to maintenance of body temperature.
An endothermic animals is an organism that produces heat through internal means, a process known as endothermy.
Animals may do this through muscle shivering or increasing metabolism.
These animals do to absorb heat from their surroundings, so the term endothermic has distinct uses related to chemical reactions or maintenance of body temperature.
The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy.
Ectothermic animals ( cold-blooded ) do absorb heat from their surroundings.
