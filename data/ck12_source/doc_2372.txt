Explain how to calculate area, volume, and density.
Identify units of area, volume, and density.
This scientist is using a calculator.
Doing science often requires calculations.
Converting units—say from inches to centimeters—is one type of calculation that might be required.
Calculations may also be needed to find derived quantities.
What Are Derived Quantities?
Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more measurements.
Derived quantities cannot be measured directly.
They can only be computed.
Many derived quantities are calculated in physical science.
Three examples are area, volume, and density.
The area of a surface is how much space it covers.
It’s easy to calculate the area of a surface if it has a regular shape, such as the blue rectangle in the sketch below.
You simply substitute measurements of the surface into the correct formula.
To find the area of a rectangular surface, use this formula:
Area (rectangular surface) = length × width (l × w)
Q:
What is the area of the blue rectangle?
A:
