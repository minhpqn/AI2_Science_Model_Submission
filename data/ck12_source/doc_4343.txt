Bone also provides more protection for soft tissues and internal organs.
As shown in Figure below , the vertebrate endoskeleton includes a cranium, or skull, to enclose and protect the brain.
It also generally includes two pairs of limbs.
Limb girdles (such as the human hips and shoulders) connect the limbs to the rest of the endoskeleton.
Vertebrate Endoskeletons.
The vertebrate endoskeleton includes a vertebral column, cranium, limbs, and limb girdles.
Can you find these parts in each endoskeleton shown here?
Other Vertebrate Traits
There are several additional traits found in virtually all vertebrates.
Vertebrates have a system of muscles attached to the endoskeleton to enable movement.
Muscles control movement by alternately contracting (shortening) and relaxing (lengthening).
Generally, muscles work together in opposing pairs.
Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system with a heart.
Blood is completely contained within blood vessels that carry the blood throughout the body.
The heart is divided into chambers that work together to pump blood.
There are between two and four chambers in the vertebrate heart.
With more chambers, there is more oxygen in the blood and more vigorous pumping action.
Most vertebrates have skin covered with scales, feathers, fur, or hair.
These features serve a variety of functions, such as waterproofing and insulating the body.
Vertebrates have an excretory system that includes a pair of kidneys.
