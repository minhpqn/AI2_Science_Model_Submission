It takes special equipment, such as a desalination plant, and a lot of energy (and money) to convert salt water into fresh water.
Of all the water on Earth, only about 1% can be used for drinking water.
Almost all of the rest of the water is either salt water in the ocean or ice in glaciers and ice caps.
As a result, there are water shortages many places in the world.
Since we have such a limited supply of water, it is important to preserve our water supplies.
Therefore, steps have been taken to prevent water pollution.
Technologies have also been developed to conserve water and prevent water pollution .
Sub-Saharan African countries have the most vulnerable water supplies.
Some scientists believe of a potential future crisis in both Asia and Africa from pollution and depletion of natural water resources.
Many countries in the Middle East are at an extreme risk of water shortages.
Diminished water supplies could increase the risk of both internal conflicts or wars between countries.
Preventing Water Pollution
In the U.S., concern over water pollution has resulted in many federal laws.
Some of these laws go all the way back to the 1800s!
The laws prohibit the disposal of any waste into the nationâ€™s rivers, lakes, streams, and other bodies of water, unless a person first has a permit.
Growing concern for controlling water pollutants led to the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972.
The Clean Water Act set water quality standards.
It also limits the pollution that can enter the waterways.
Other countries are also actively preventing water pollution and purifying water ( Figure below ).
