It may always fear other dogs or act aggressively toward them.
How Behaviors Evolve
It’s easy to see how many common types of behavior evolve.
That’s because they obviously increase the fitness of the animal performing them.
For example, when wolves hunt together in a pack, they are more likely to catch prey (see Figure below ).
Therefore, hunting with others increases a wolf’s fitness.
The wolf is more likely to survive and pass its genes to the next generation by behaving this way.
Wolves hunting together in pack
Wolves hunt together in packs.
This is adaptive because it increases their chances of killing prey and obtaining food.
The evolution of certain other types of behavior is not as easy to explain.
An example is a squirrel chattering loudly to warn other squirrels that a predator is near.
This is likely to help the other squirrels avoid the predator.
Therefore, it could increase their fitness.
But what about the squirrel raises the alarm?
This squirrel is more likely to be noticed by the predator.
Therefore, the behavior may actually lower this squirrel’s fitness.
How could such a behavior evolve through natural selection?
One possible answer is that helping others often means helping close relatives.
Close relatives share many of the same genes that they inherited from their common ancestor.
