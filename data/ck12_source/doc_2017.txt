They feed on phytoplankton.

The phytoplankton (left) and zooplankton (right) shown here have been magnified.
Otherwise, they would be too small for you to see.
Nekton are living things that swim through the water ( Figure below ).
They may live at any depth, in the photic or aphotic zone.
Most nekton are fish, although some are mammals.
Fish have fins and streamlined bodies to help them swim.
Fish also have gills to take oxygen from the water.

Nekton swim through ocean water.
Benthos are living organisms on the ocean floor.
Many benthic organisms attach themselves to rocks and stay in one place.
This protects them from crashing waves and other water movements.
Some benthic organisms burrow into sediments for food or protection.
Benthic animals may crawl over the ocean floor.
Examples of benthos include clams and worms.
Pictured below are two other examples ( Figure below ).
