Q:
You might put a 1.5-volt battery in a TV remote.
The battery in a car is a 12-volt battery.
How do you think the current of a 12-volt battery compares to the current of a 1.5-volt battery?
A:
Greater voltage means a greater difference in potential energy, so the 12-volt battery can produce more current than the 1.5-volt battery.
Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges.
The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A).
An electric charge flows when it has electric potential energy due to its position in an electric field.
An electric charge always moves spontaneously from a position of higher to lower potential energy.
For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions.
This difference is called voltage.
The SI unit for voltage is the volt (V).
