Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as freshwater, need a way to prevent their cells from taking in too much water by osmosis.
A contractile vacuole is a type of vacuole that removes excess water from a cell.
Freshwater protists, such as the paramecium shown in Figure below , have a contractile vacuole.
The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm.
After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole.
When the vacuole is full, it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore.

The contractile vacuole is the star-like structure within the paramecia.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with the higher solute concentration is hypertonic, and the solution with the lower concentration is hypotonic.
Solutions of equal solute concentration are isotonic.
