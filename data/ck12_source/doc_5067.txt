Mitochondria, organelles specialized to carry out aerobic respiration, contain an inner membrane folded into cristae, which form two separate compartments: the inner membrane space and the matrix.
The Krebs Cycle takes place in the matrix.
The electron transport chain is embedded in the inner membrane and uses both compartments to make ATP by chemiosmosis .
Mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes, resembling those of prokaryotic organisms.
The double membrane nature of the mitochondria results in five distinct compartments, each with an important role in cellular respiration.
These compartments are:
the outer mitochondrial membrane,
the intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes),
the inner mitochondrial membrane,
the cristae (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane), and
the matrix (space within the inner membrane).
The roles of these compartments in cellular respiration include:
the outer mitochondrial membrane: allows for the establishment of the inter membrane space,
the intermembrane space: holds protons that are pumped out of the matrix during electron transport,
the inner mitochondrial membrane: organizes the electron transport chain and holds ATP synthase ,
the cristae: expand the surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane, enhancing its ability to produce ATP, and
the matrix: site of ATP synthesis and the location of the Krebs cycle.
ATP synthase :
Ion channel and enzyme complex; chemically bonds a phosphate group to ADP, producing ATP as H + ions flow through the ion channel.
chemiosmosis :
