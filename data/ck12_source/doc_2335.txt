The first telescope was invented in the early 1600s.
The inventor was probably a Dutch lens maker named Hans Lippershey.
He and his telescope are pictured in Figure below .
Lippershey used scientific knowledge of the properties of light and lenses to design his telescope.
Hans Lippershey, the inventor of the telescope
Hans Lippershey is credited with making the first practical telescope in 1608.
He is pictured here using his invention to view distant objects.
Officials of the Dutch government recognized the importance of Lippershey’s invention.
They gave him a generous sum of money for his design.
Lippershey’s new technology quickly spread all over Europe.
Almost immediately, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo started working to improve Lippershey’s design.
In just two years, Galileo had made a more powerful telescope.
It could make very distant objects visible to the human eye.
The Figure below shows Galileo demonstrating his powerful telescope.
It appears to be focused on the moon.
Galileo started using his telescope to explore the night sky.
He soon made some remarkable discoveries.
He observed hills and valleys on the moon and spots on the sun.
He discovered that Jupiter has moons and that the sun rotates on its axis.
With his discoveries, Galileo was able to prove that the sun, not Earth, is at the center of the solar system.
