In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth.
In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds.
The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex.
The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal.
Intelligence of Mammals
Mammals are very intelligent.
Of all vertebrates, they are the animals that are most capable of learning.
Mammalian offspring are fed and taken care of by their parents for a relatively long time.
This gives them plenty of time to learn from their parents.
By learning, they can benefit from the experiences of their elders.
The ability to learn is the main reason that the large mammalian brain evolved.
Itâ€™s also the primary reason for the success of mammals.
Mammals may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.
They have four types of teeth, so they can eat a wide range of foods.
Traits of the heart and lungs keep the cells of mammals well supplied with oxygen and nutrients.
Mammals have a relatively large brain and a high level of intelligence.
