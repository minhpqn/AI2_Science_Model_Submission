You can learn the new route just as you learned the old one.
Although most animals can learn, animals with greater intelligence are better at learning and have more learned behaviors.
Humans are the most intelligent animals.
They depend on learned behaviors more than any other species.
Other highly intelligent species include apes, our closest relatives in the animal kingdom.
They include chimpanzees and gorillas.
Both are also very good at learning behaviors.
You may have heard of a gorilla named Koko.
The psychologist, Dr.
Francine Patterson, raised Koko.
Dr.
Patterson wanted to find out if gorillas could learn human language.
Starting when Koko was just one year old, Dr.
Patterson taught her to use sign language.
Koko learned to use and understand more than 1,000 signs.
Koko showed how much gorillas can learn.

Think about some of the behaviors you have learned.
They might include riding a bicycle, using a computer, and playing a musical instrument or sport.
You probably did not learn all of these behaviors in the same way.
