Graph of how particle size and water velocity affect erosion and deposition
Flowing water erodes or deposits particles depending on how fast the water is moving.
It also depends on how big the particles are.
Erosion in the Mountains
Streams often start in mountains, where the land is very steep ( Figure below ).
A mountain stream flows very quickly because of the steep slope.
This causes a lot of erosion and very little deposition.
The rapidly falling water digs down into the stream bed and makes it deeper.
It carves a narrow, V-shaped channel.
Stream flowing over a waterfall
This mountain stream is in Whitney Portal in the Sierra Nevada of California.
The slope is so steep that water cascades down in a waterfall.
How a Waterfall Forms
Mountain streams may erode waterfalls.
A waterfall forms where a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock ( Figure below ).
The water erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock.
This causes the stream bed to drop down, like a step.
This creates a waterfall.
As erosion continues, the waterfall gradually moves upstream.
