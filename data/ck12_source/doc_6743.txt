We call the quantity  mg  an object's weight .
Unlike an object's mass, an object's weight can change and depends on the gravitational force it experiences.
In fact, an object's weight is the magnitude of the gravitational force on it.
To find the weight of an object on another planet, star, or moon, use the appropriate values in the formula for the force of gravity.
Gravity and Orbits (PhET Simulation)
Which is greater – the gravitational force that the Sun exerts on the moon, or the force the Earth exerts on the moon?
Does the moon orbit the Earth or the Sun?
Explain.
Use Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation to explain why even though Jupiter has 300 times the mass of the earth, on the “surface” of Jupiter you’d weigh only 3 times what you weigh on earth.
What other factor has to be considered here?
Prove g is approximately 10 \ m/s^2 on Earth by following these steps:
Calculate the force of gravity between a falling object (for example an apple) and that of Earth.
Use the symbol m_o to represent the mass of the falling object.
Now divide that force by the object’s mass to find the acceleration g of the object.
Calculate the force of gravity between the Sun and the Earth. (sun mass = 2.0 \times 10^{30} \ kg; average distance from sun to earth = 150 million km)
Calculate the gravitational force that your pencil or pen pulls on you.
Use the center of your chest as the center of mass (and thus the mark for the distance measurement) and estimate all masses and distances.
If there were no other forces present, what would your acceleration be towards your pencil?
Is this a large or small acceleration?
Why, in fact, doesn’t your pencil accelerate towards you?
