Wave Frequency and Energy
The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave.
For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly.
This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude.
You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.)
Relationship between frequency and energy
Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time.
The SI unit for wave frequency is the hertz (Hz), where 1 hertz equals 1 wave passing a fixed point in 1 second.
A higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude.
At the following URL, use the wave simulator to make waves with various amounts of energy.
Measure the frequency and wavelength of the waves, and check your measurements.
Then answer the question at the bottom of the Web page.
What is wave frequency?
