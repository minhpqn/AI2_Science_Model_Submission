Mendel noticed plants in his own garden that werenâ€™t a blend of the parents.
For example, a tall plant and a short plant had offspring that were either tall or short but not medium in height.
Observations such as these led Mendel to question the blending theory.
He wondered if there was a different underlying principle that could explain how characteristics are inherited.
He decided to experiment with pea plants to find out.
In fact, Mendel experimented with almost 30,000 pea plants over the next several years!
At the following link, you can watch an animation in which Mendel explains how he arrived at his decision to study inheritance in pea plants:
Why Study Pea Plants?
Why did Mendel choose common, garden-variety pea plants for his experiments?
Pea plants are a good choice because they are fast growing and easy to raise.
They also have several visible characteristics that may vary.
These characteristics, which are shown in Figure below , include seed form and color, flower color, pod form and color, placement of pods and flowers on stems, and stem length.
Each characteristic has two common values.
For example, seed form may be round or wrinkled, and flower color may be white or purple (violet).
Summary of the characteristics Mendel studied
Mendel investigated seven different characteristics in pea plants.
In this chart, cotyledons refer to the tiny leaves inside seeds.
Axial pods are located along the stems.
Terminal pods are located at the ends of the stems.
To research how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, Mendel needed to control pollination.
