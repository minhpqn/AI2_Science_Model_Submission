The general formula for a monosaccharide is:
(CH 2 O) n ,
where n can be any number greater than two.
For example, in glucose n is 6, and the formula is:
C 6 H 12 O 6 .
Another monosaccharide, fructose, has the same chemical formula as glucose, but the atoms are arranged differently.
Molecules with the same chemical formula but with atoms in a different arrangement are called isomers .
Compare the glucose and fructose molecules in Figure below .
Can you identify their differences?
The only differences are the positions of some of the atoms.
These differences affect the properties of the two monosaccharides.
Structure of a sucrose molecule
Sucrose Molecule.
This sucrose molecule is a disaccharide.
It is made up of two monosaccharides: glucose on the left and fructose on the right.
If two monosaccharides bond together, they form a carbohydrate called a disaccharide .
An example of a disaccharide is sucrose (table sugar), which consists of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose ( Figure above ).
Monosaccharides and disaccharides are also called simple sugars .
They provide the major source of energy to living cells
A polysaccharide is a complex carbohydrate that forms when simple sugars bind together in a chain.
