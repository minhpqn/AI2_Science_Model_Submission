He thought about the bathymetric features and the patterns of magnetic polarity on the seafloor.
In 1962, Hess published a new idea that he called seafloor spreading .
Hess wrote that hot magma rises up into the rift valley at the mid-ocean ridges.
The lava cools to form new seafloor.
Later more lava erupts at the ridge.
The new lava pushes the seafloor horizontally away from the ridge axis ( Figure below ).
The seafloor moves!
Magnetite crystals in the lava point in the direction of the magnetic north pole.
The different stripes of magnetic polarity reveal the different ages of the seafloor.
In some places, the oceanic crust comes up to a continent.
The moving crust pushes that continent away from the ridge axis as well.
If the moving oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, the crust sinks into the mantle.
The creation and destruction of oceanic crust is the reason that continents move.

Magma at the mid-ocean ridge creates new seafloor.
These animations show the creation of magnetic stripes of normal and reversed polarity at a mid-ocean ridge: and
As oceanic crust moves away from the ridge crest, it pushes a continent away from the ridge axis.
If the oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, it sinks into the trench.
The oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean.
The flat topped guyots were once active volcanoes that were above sea level.
