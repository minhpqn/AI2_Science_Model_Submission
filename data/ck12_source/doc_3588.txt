Each small circle in the diagram represents one carbon atom.
For example, citric acid is a six carbon molecule, and OAA (oxaloacetate) is a four carbon molecule.
Follow what happens to the carbon atoms as the cycle proceeds.
In one turn through the cycle, how many molecules are produced of ATP?
How many molecules of NADH and FADH 2 are produced?
Before the Krebs cycle begins, pyruvic acid, which has three carbon atoms, is split apart and combined with an enzyme known as CoA, which stands for coenzyme A.
The product of this reaction is a two-carbon molecule called acetyl-CoA.
The third carbon from pyruvic acid combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is released as a waste product.
High-energy electrons are also released and captured in NADH.
Steps of the Krebs Cycle
The Krebs cycle itself actually begins when acetyl-CoA combines with a four-carbon molecule called OAA (oxaloacetate) (see Figure above ).
This produces citric acid, which has six carbon atoms.
This is why the Krebs cycle is also called the citric acid cycle .
After citric acid forms, it goes through a series of reactions that release energy.
The energy is captured in molecules of NADH, ATP, and FADH 2 , another energy-carrying compound.
Carbon dioxide is also released as a waste product of these reactions.
The final step of the Krebs cycle regenerates OAA, the molecule that began the Krebs cycle.
This molecule is needed for the next turn through the cycle.
Two turns are needed because glycolysis produces two pyruvic acid molecules when it splits glucose.
