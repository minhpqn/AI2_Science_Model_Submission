Effects of Pollutants
Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things.
About 22 million people die from air pollution each year.
Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer.
Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases.
Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution.
That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing.
Children also take in more air for their size than adults do.
Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things.
The type of damage depends on the pollutant.
Air pollution can also harm the environment.
Types of Pollutants
This concept explores the effects of different pollutants on the environment and human health.
The pollutants include particulates, ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, and VOCs.
Particulates cause lung diseases.
They can also increase the risk of heart disease and the number of asthma attacks.
Particulates block sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface.
This means there is less energy for photosynthesis.
Less photosynthesis means that plants and phytoplankton produce less food.
This affects whole ecosystems.
