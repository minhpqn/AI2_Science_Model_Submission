What allowed scientists to see a virus for the first time?
Explain how viruses replicate.
Distinguish between replication of a DNA virus and RNA virus.
Define reverse transcriptase.
Notice the viruses sitting on the bacteria?
Why is the virus sitting here?
Remember, viruses are not living.
So how do they replicate?
Replication of Viruses
Populations of viruses do not grow through cell division because they are not cells.
Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce new copies of themselves.
After infecting a host cell, a virion uses the cell’s ribosomes, enzymes, ATP, and other components to replicate.
Viruses vary in how they do this.
For example:
Some RNA viruses are translated directly into viral proteins in ribosomes of the host cell.
The host ribosomes treat the viral RNA as though it were the host’s own mRNA.
Some DNA viruses are first transcribed in the host cell into viral mRNA.
Then the viral mRNA is translated by host cell ribosomes into viral proteins.
In either case, the newly made viral proteins assemble to form new virions.
The virions may then direct the production of an enzyme that breaks down the host cell wall.
