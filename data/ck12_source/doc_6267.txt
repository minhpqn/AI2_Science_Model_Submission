What do you need to determine to solve enthalpy stoichiometry problems?
If I react 1.75 moles of methane, how much energy will be involved?
I ran a reaction producing sulfur dioxide and releasing 267.3 kJ of energy.
How many moles of sulfur dioxide were involved in the reaction?
Heats of Fusion and Solidification
Define heat of fusion.
Define heat of solidification.
Perform calculations of energy changes during the transition from solid to liquid or liquid to solid.
When an object melts, the temperature stays constant
What makes the ice melt?
Suppose you hold an ice cube in your hand.
It feels cold because heat energy leaves your hand and enters the ice cube.
What happens to the ice cube?
It melts.
However, the temperature during a phase change remains constant.  So the heat that is being lost by your hand does not raise the temperature of the ice above its melting temperature of 0°C.
Rather, all the heat goes into the change of state.
Energy is absorbed during the process of changing ice into water.
The water that is produced also remains at 0°C until all of the ice is melted.
