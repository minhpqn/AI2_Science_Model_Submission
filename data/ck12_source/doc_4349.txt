The earliest vertebrates were jawless fish, similar to living hagfish.
They lived between 500 and 600 million years ago.
They had a cranium but no vertebral column.
The phylogenetic tree in Figure below gives an overview of vertebrate evolution.
As more data become available, new ideas about vertebrate evolution emerge.

Phylogenetic Tree of Vertebrate Evolution.
The earliest vertebrates evolved almost 550 million years ago.
Which class of vertebrates evolved last?
Evolution of Fish
Not too long after hagfish first appeared, fish similar to lampreys evolved a partial vertebral column.
The first fish with a complete vertebral column evolved about 450 million years ago.
These fish also had jaws and may have been similar to living sharks.
Up to this point, all early vertebrates had an endoskeleton made of cartilage rather than bone.
About 400 million years ago, the first bony fish appeared.
A bony skeleton could support a larger body.
Early bony fish evolved into modern ray-finned and lobe-finned fish.
Evolution of Other Vertebrate Classes
Amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds evolved after fish.
The first amphibians evolved from a lobe-finned fish ancestor about 365 million years ago.
