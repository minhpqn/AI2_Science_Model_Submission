The force which an effort force must overcome in order to do work on an object via a simple machine.
ideal mechanical advantage:  The factor by which a mechanism multiplies the force put into it.
The mechanical advantage is called the ideal mechanical advantage if there is no friction or if friction is ignored.
Generally, the mechanical advantage is calculated as follows: \text{MA}=\frac{\text{distance over which effort is applied}}{\text{distance over which the load is moved}}
actual mechanical advantage:  The mechanical advantage of a real machine.
Actual mechanical advantage takes into consideration real world factors such as energy lost in friction.
In this way, it differs from the ideal mechanical advantage, which, is a sort of 'theoretical limit' to the efficiency.
The AMA of a machine is calculated with the following formula: \text{AMA}=\frac{\text{resistance force}}{\text{effort force}} .
compound machine:
A combination of two or more simple machines.
