Frequencies of crossing-over can be used to construct a linkage map like the one in Figure below .
A linkage map shows the locations of genes on a chromosome.
Linkage map for the human X chromosome
Linkage Map for the Human X Chromosome.
This linkage map shows the locations of several genes on the X chromosome.
Some of the genes code for normal proteins.
Others code for abnormal proteins that lead to genetic disorders.
Which pair of genes would you expect to have a lower frequency of crossing-over: the genes that code for hemophilia A and G6PD deficiency, or the genes that code for protan and Xm?
Linked genes are located on the same chromosome.
Sex-linked genes are located on a sex chromosome, and X-linked genes are located on the X chromosome.
The frequency of crossing-over between genes is used to construct linkage maps that show the locations of genes on chromosomes.
