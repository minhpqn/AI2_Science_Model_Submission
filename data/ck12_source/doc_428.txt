Atherosclerosis ( Figure below ) is an inflammation of the walls of arteries that causes swelling and a buildup of material called plaque.
Plaque is made of cell pieces, fatty substances, calcium, and connective tissue that builds up around the area of inflammation.
As a plaque grows, it stiffens and narrows the artery, which decreases the flow of blood through the artery.
Atherosclerosis occurs when artery walls become inflamed and plaque builds up
Atherosclerosis is sometimes referred to as hardening of the arteries; plaque build-up decreases the blood flow through the artery.
Atherosclerosis normally begins in late childhood and is typically found in most major arteries.
It does not usually have any early symptoms.
Causes of atherosclerosis include a high-fat diet, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and diabetes.
Atherosclerosis becomes a threat to health when the plaque buildup prevents blood circulation in the heart or the brain.
A blocked blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart attack.
Blockage of the circulation in the brain can cause a stroke.
Ways to prevent atherosclerosis include eating healthy foods, getting plenty of exercise and not smoking.
These three factors are not as hard to control as you may think.
If you smoke, STOP.
Start a regular exercise program and watch what you eat.
A diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, which makes more plaque available to line artery walls and narrow your arteries.
Cholesterol and saturated fats are found mostly in animal products such as meat, eggs, milk, and other dairy products.
Check food labels to find the amount of saturated fat in a product.
Also, avoid large amounts of salt and sugar.
Be careful with processed foods, such as frozen dinners, as they can be high in fat, sugar, salt and cholesterol.
