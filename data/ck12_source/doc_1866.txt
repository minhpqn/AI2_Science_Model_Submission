Wet soil becomes slippery and heavy.
Earthquakes often trigger landslides.
The shaking ground causes soil and rocks to break loose and start sliding.
Rapid downslope movement of material is seen in this video:
Mudflows and Lahars
A mudflow is the sudden flow of mud down a slope because of gravity.
Mudflows occur where the soil is mostly clay.
Like landslides, mudflows usually occur when the soil is wet.
Wet clay forms very slippery mud that slides easily.
Mudflows follow river channels, washing out bridges, trees, and homes that are in their path.
A debris flow is seen in this video:
A lahar is mudflow that flows down a composite volcano ( Figure below ).
Ash mixes with snow and ice melted by the eruption to produce hot, fast-moving flows.
The lahar caused by the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Columbia in 1985 killed more than 23,000 people.
A lahar is a mudflow that forms from volcanic ash and debris
A lahar is a mudflow that forms from volcanic ash and debris.
This lahar comes off of Tunguragua volcano in Ecuador.
Slump and Creep
Less dramatic types of mass wasting move Earth materials slowly down a hillside.
Slump is the sudden movement of large blocks of rock and soil down a slope. ( Figure below ).
