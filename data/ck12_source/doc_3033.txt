Alvin is no longer used for ocean exploration, but by the time it was retired, it had made thousands of dives.
Alvin was even used to explore the Titanic on the North Atlantic Ocean floor.
Q :
Why must divers use special diving machines such as Alvin and Deepsea Challenger to go deep below the surface of the ocean?
Why can’t they just use scuba diving gear?
A :
The pressure of the water is too great that far below the surface.
It would crush divers long before they could reach the bottom.
Water Pressure and Depth
Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area.
As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases steadily.
That’s because there is more and more water pressing down on you from above.
The Figure below shows how pressure changes with depth.
For each additional meter below the surface, pressure increases by 10 kPa.
At 30 meters below the surface, the pressure is double the pressure at the surface.
At a depth greater than 500 meters, the pressure is too great for humans to withstand without special equipment to protect them.
At nearly 11,000 meters below the surface, the pressure is tremendous.
