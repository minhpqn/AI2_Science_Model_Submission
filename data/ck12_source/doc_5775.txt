Lanthanides and actinides are elements with unfilled f orbitals.
Lanthanides are all metals with reactivity similar to group 2 elements.
Actinides are all radioactive elements.
Lanthanides are used in optical devices (night vision goggles), petroleum refining, and alloys.
Actinides are found primarily in applications where their radioactivity can be used to power devices such as cardiac pacemakers.

List some uses for lanthanides.
List some uses for actinides.
lanthanide:
The lanthanides are the 14 elements from cerium (atomic number 58) to lutetium (atomic number 71).
The word comes from the Greek "lanthanein" meaning "to be hidden."
actinide:
The actinides are the 14 elements from thorium (atomic number 90) to lawrencium (atomic number 103).
The 5f  sublevel is in the process of being filled.
