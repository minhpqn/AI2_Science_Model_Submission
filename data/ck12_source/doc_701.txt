If the object distance is 1000.0 cm, find the image distance and the magnification.
Solution:  \frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f} so \frac{1}{1000.}+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{-20.0}
Multiplying both sides by 1000x  yields x + 1000 = -50x  and 51x = -1000  and x = -19.6 \text{ cm} .
Since the image distance is negative, it means the image is behind the mirror and is virtual.
The image will be upright.
m=\frac{-d_i}{d_o}=\frac{-(-19.6)}{1000}=0.0196 \ or \ \frac{1}{51}
The image is reduced by a factor of 51.
For a convex mirror, if the object is at infinity, the image will be a dot on the focal point.
As the object moves from infinity toward the mirror, the image moves along the principal axis toward the mirror.
When the object right next to the mirror, the image will be right next to the mirror on the other side.
All ray diagrams for convex mirrors look essentially like the image below, with the placement of the image somewhere between the mirror and the focal point.
Image formed by a convex mirror
The ray tracing for convex mirrors follow this general sketch.
Two rays leave the tip of the object, one approaches the mirror parallel and reflects as if it came from the focal point.
The top blue dotted line shows this imaginary route.
The second ray leaves the object tip and approaches the mirror toward the focal point but reflects parallel at the mirror.
The green solid line shows the reflected ray and the dotted green line shows the imaginary route behind the mirror.
Where the two dotted lines intersect is the tip of the image.
All images in convex mirrors are upright, virtual, and diminished.
As the object moves toward the mirror, the image also moves toward the mirror and increases in size.
