Chemical Structure and Properties of Water
You are probably already familiar with many of water’s properties.
For example, you no doubt know that water is tasteless, odorless, and transparent.
In small quantities, it is also colorless.
However, when a large amount of water is observed, as in a lake or the ocean, it is actually light blue in color.
The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective absorption and scattering of white light.
These and other properties of water depend on its chemical structure.
The transparency of water is important for organisms that live in water.
Because water is transparent, sunlight can pass through it.
Sunlight is needed by water plants and other water organisms for photosynthesis.
Chemical Structure of Water
Each molecule of water consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen, so it has the chemical formula H 2 O.
The arrangement of atoms in a water molecule, shown in Figure below , explains many of water’s chemical properties.
In each water molecule, the nucleus of the oxygen atom (with 8 positively charged protons) attracts electrons much more strongly than do the hydrogen nuclei (with only one positively charged proton).
This results in a negative electrical charge near the oxygen atom (due to the "pull" of the negatively charged electrons toward the oxygen nucleus) and a positive electrical charge near the hydrogen atoms.
A difference in electrical charge between different parts of a molecule is called polarity .
A polar molecule is a molecule in which part of the molecule is positively charged and part of the molecule is negatively charged.
This model shows the arrangement of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a water molecule.
A water molecule has a bent or angular (non-linear) shape, with an angle of about 105°.
The nucleus of the oxygen atom attracts electrons more strongly than do the hydrogen nuclei.
