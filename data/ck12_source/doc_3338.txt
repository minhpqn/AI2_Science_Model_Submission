An integrated circuit (microchip) is an electronic component that consists of many other electronic components such as transistors.
Integrated circuits are used in virtually all modern electronic devices to carry out specific tasks.

What are Electronic Devices?
Many of the devices people commonly use today are electronic devices.
Electronic devices use electric current to encode, analyze, or transmit information.
In addition to computers, they include mobile phones, TV remotes, DVD and CD players, and digital cameras, to name just a few.
