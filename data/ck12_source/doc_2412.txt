Copper, like other metals, is ductile.
This means that it can be rolled and stretched into long thin shapes such as wires.
Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to an entirely different substance.
Physical properties are typically things you can detect with your senses.
Examples of physical properties of matter include melting point, color, hardness, state of matter, odor, and boiling point.
Water is one of the most important substances on Earth, and it has some unique physical properties.
Read in detail about any one of the physical properties of water at the URL below.
Then make a poster or video demonstrating this property of water.
What is a physical property of matter?
List three examples of physical properties.
Compare and contrast two physical properties of apples and oranges.
Demonstrate how to calculate density.
The man in this cartoon is filling balloons with helium gas.
What will happen if he lets go of the filled balloons?
They will rise up into the air until they reach the ceiling.
Do you know why?
Itâ€™s because helium has less density than air.
Density is an important physical property of matter.
It reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are.
When particles are packed together more tightly, matter has greater density.
