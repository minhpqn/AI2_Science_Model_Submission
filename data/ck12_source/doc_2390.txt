Using a sheet of graph paper, create a graph of the data in question 3.
Use the type of graph you identified in your answer to question 3.
Identify properties of useful models in science.
Describe examples of simple models in physical science.
Did you ever read a road map like this one?
Maybe not, but youâ€™ve probably made a sketch of a house or other object and played with toy cars or dolls.
What do all these activities have in common?
They all involve models.
What Is a Model?
A model is a representation of an object, system, or process.
For example, a road map is a representation of an actual system of roads on the ground.
Models are very useful in science.
They provide a way to investigate things that are too small, large, complex, or distant to investigate directly.
To be useful, a model must closely represent the real thing in important ways, but it must be simpler and easier to understand than the real thing.
Q:
What might be examples of things that would be modeled in physical science because they are difficult to investigate directly?
