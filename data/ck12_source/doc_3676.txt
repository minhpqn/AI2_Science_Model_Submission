Mendelian inheritance does not apply to the inheritance of alleles that result in incomplete dominance and codominance.
Explain why this is so.
Describe the relationship between environment and phenotype.
Mendel investigated stem length, or height, in pea plants.
What if he had investigated human height instead?
Why would his results have been harder to interpret?
Define human genome.
Distinguish autosomes from sex chromosomes.
Describe the Human Genome Project.
All these ACGTs.
What are they?
Over three billion of them from a human form the human genome - the human genetic material - all the information needed to encode a human being.
It would take about 9.5 years to read out loud - without stopping - the more than three billion pairs of bases in one person's genome.
The Human Genome
What makes each one of us unique?
You could argue that the environment plays a role, and it does to some extent.
But most would agree that your parents have something to do with your uniqueness.
In fact, it is our genes that make each one of us unique â€“ or at least genetically unique.
We all have the genes that make us human: the genes for skin and bones, eyes and ears, fingers and toes, and so on.
However, we all have different skin colors, different bone sizes, different eye colors and different ear shapes.
