Explain the role of the leaf in photosynthesis.
Distinguish between mesophyll, veins, and the epidermis.
Explain the significance of stomata and guard cells.
Oxygen — the oxygen that we breath — is just a waste product of what reaction?
Every split second that sunlight hits that leaf, photosynthesis is initiated, bringing energy into the ecosystem.
It could be said that this is one of the most important - if not the absolutely most important - biochemical reactions.
And it all starts with the leaf.
Factories for Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process that uses energy from the sun, together with carbon dioxide and water, to make glucose and oxygen.
The primary role of photosynthesis is to make the carbohydrate, suggesting that oxygen, which is released back into the atmosphere, is just a waste product.
You can think of a single leaf as a photosynthesis factory.
A factory has specialized machines to produce a product.
It’s also connected to a transportation system that supplies it with raw materials and carries away the finished product.
In all these ways, a leaf resembles a factory.
The cross section of a leaf in Figure below lets you look inside a leaf “factory.”
Parts of a leaf
There’s more to a leaf than meets the eye.
Can you identify the functions of each of the labeled structures in the diagram?
A leaf consists of several different kinds of specialized tissues that work together to make food by photosynthesis.
The major tissues are mesophyll, veins, and epidermis.
