The phylum Annelida is made up of segmented worms such as earthworms .
Segmented worms are divided into many repeating segments.
There are roughly 15,000 species of annelids.
Most belong to one of three classes.
A species in each class is pictured in Figure below .
See The Cambrian Explosion at for an introduction to annelids.
Classes of annelids
Classes of Annelids.
The majority of annelids are polychaetes.
They live on the ocean floor, so you may not be familiar with them.
Structure and Function of Annelids
Annelids range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 3 meters.
They never attain the large size of some mollusks.
Like mollusks, however, they have a coelom.
In fact, the annelid coelom is even larger, allowing greater development of internal organs.
Annelids have other similarities with mollusks, including:
A closed circulatory system (like cephalopods).
An excretory system consisting of tubular nephridia.
A complete digestive system.
Sensory organs for detecting light and other stimuli.
