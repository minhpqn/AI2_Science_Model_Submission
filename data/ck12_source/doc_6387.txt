The Bronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases expands Arrhenius's definition of acids and bases
A new theory
The Arrhenius concept of acids and bases was a significant contribution to our understanding of acids and bases.
It replaced and expanded the original idea of Lavoisier that all acids contained oxygen.
However, the Arrhenius theory had its shortcomings also.
It did not take into account the role of the solvent.
In addition, this concept did not deal with acid-base behavior in solvents such as benzene where there could be no ionization.
So, a new theory needed to be formed, which built on the findings of Arrhenius but also went beyond them.
Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
The Arrhenius definition of acids and bases is somewhat limited.
There are some compounds whose properties suggest that they are either acidic or basic, but which do not qualify according to the Arrhenius definition.
An example is ammonia (NH 3 ).
Its aqueous solution turns litmus blue, it reacts with acids, and displays all the other properties of a base.
However, it does not contain the hydroxide ion.
