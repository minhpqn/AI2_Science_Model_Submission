The reaction rate indicates how fast the reaction proceeds.
Read the material at the link below and answer the following questions:
Why is the rate of disappearance a negative value?
What is the average rate of reaction?
What is the instantaneous rate of reaction?
What is another word for rate?
What does [ ] stand for?
What are the units of reaction rate?
reaction rate:
The change in concentration of a reactant or product with time.
Define collision theory.
Only collisions at high speed will cause changes
Car damage can be very expensive, especially if the person hitting your car does not have insurance.
Many people have had the experience of backing up while parallel parking and hearing that “bump”.
Fortunately, there is often no damage because the cars were not going fast enough.
But every once in a while there is a rearrangement of the body parts of a car when it is hit with sufficient speed.
Then things need to be fixed.
The behavior of the atoms, molecules, or ions that comprise the reactants is responsible for the rates of a given chemical reaction.
Collision theory is a set of principles that states that the reacting particles can form products when they collide with one another provided those collisions have enough kinetic energy and the correct orientation.
Particles that lack the necessary kinetic energy may collide, but the particles will simply bounce off one another unchanged.
