A hypothesis absolutely must be testable-- it gains credibility by being tested over and over again, and by surviving attempts to prove it wrong.
Scientists may test and reject several hypotheses before solving a problem.
Scientific investigations involve the collection of data through observation, the formation and testing of hypotheses by experimentation, and analysis of the results that involves reasoning.
Scientific investigations begin with observations that lead to questions.
We will use an everyday example to show what makes up a scientific investigation.
Imagine that you walk into a room, and the room is dark.
You observe that the room appears dark, and you question why the room is dark.
In an attempt to find explanations to this phenomenon, you develop several different hypotheses.
One hypothesis might be that the room does not have a light source at all.
Another hypothesis might be that the lights are turned off.
Still, another might be that the light bulb has burnt out.
Worse yet, you could be going blind.
To discover the answer, you experiment.
You feel your way around the room and find a light switch and turn it on.
No light.
You repeat the experiment, flicking the switch back and forth; still nothing.
This means your first two hypotheses, that the room is dark because (1) it does not have a light source; and (2) the lights are off, have been disproved.
You think of more experiments to test your hypotheses, such as switching on a flashlight to prove that you are not blind.
In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the answer, you could predict that changing the light bulb will fix the problem.
If your predictions about this hypothesis succeed (changing the light bulb fixes the problem), the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted.
