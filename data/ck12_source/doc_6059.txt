Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound that consists of a multitude of strong ionic bonds.
Sodium chloride melts at 801째C.
Ice (solid H 2 O) is a molecular compound whose molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds.
Though hydrogen bonds are the strongest of the intermolecular forces, the strength of hydrogen bonds is much less than that of ionic bonds.
The melting point of ice is 0째C.
The melting point of a solid is the same as the freezing point of the liquid.
At that temperature, the solid and liquid states of the substance are in equilibrium.
For water, this equilibrium occurs at 0째C.

We tend to think of solids as those materials that are solid at room temperature.
However, all materials have melting points of some sort.
Gases become solids at extremely low temperatures, and liquids will also become solid if the temperature is low enough.
The Table below gives the melting points of some common materials.

Melting Point (째C)
The melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid.
Intermolecular forces have a strong influence on melting point.
