A:
You could heat the salt water to 101°C.
The water would boil and vaporize but the salt would not.
Instead, the salt would be left behind as solid particles.
Q:
Oxygen is a gas at room temperature (20°C).
What does this tell you about its boiling point?
A:
The boiling point of oxygen must be lower than 20°C.
Otherwise, it would be a liquid at room temperature.
Vaporization is the process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas.
Vaporization is easily confused with evaporation, but evaporation doesn’t involve boiling.
The temperature at which a liquid boils and starts changing to a gas is called its boiling point.
The boiling point of pure water is 100°C.

Name two factors that affect the boiling point of a substance.
Compared with the molecules of many other substances, molecules of water are strongly attracted to each other.
How is this likely to affect the boiling point of water?
What is vaporization?
