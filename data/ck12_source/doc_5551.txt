A larger or smaller piece of glass will not change this property.
An intensive property is a property of matter that depends only on the type of matter in a sample and not on the amount.
Other intensive properties include color, temperature, density, and solubility.
The copper wire shown in the picture below has a certain electrical conductivity.
You could cut off the small end sticking out and it would have the same conductivity as the entire long roll of wire shown here.
The conductivity is a property of the copper metal itself, not of the length of the wire.
