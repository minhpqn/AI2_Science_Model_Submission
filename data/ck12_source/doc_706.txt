What four points are marked on the principal axis of a lens?
A ray of light from the object that passes through the focal point on the same side of the lens as the object will refract
Under what circumstances will a convex lens form a virtual image?
An object is placed to the left of a 25 cm focal length convex lens so that its image is the same size as the object.
Determine the object and image locations.
A lens is needed to create an inverted image twice as large as the object when the object is 5.00 cm in front of the lens.
What focal length lens is needed?
Hint: \frac1{d_i}+\frac1{d_o}=\frac1f
If you have a convex lens whose focal length is 10.0 cm, where would you place an object in order to produce an image that is virtual?
Describe how a convex lens could be used to make a magnifying lens.
Determine the image distance and image height for a 5.00 cm tall object placed 45.0 cm from a double convex lens with a focal length of 15.0 cm.
Determine the image distance and image height for a 5.00 cm tall object placed 30.0 cm from a double convex lens with a focal length of 15.0 cm.
Determine the image distance and image height for a 5.00 cm tall object placed 20.0 cm from a double convex lens with a focal length of 15.0 cm.
Determine the image distance and image height for a 5.00 cm tall object placed 10.0 cm from a double convex lens with a focal length of 15.0 cm.
convex lens:
A lens having atleast one surface that curves outward like the exterior of a sphere.
