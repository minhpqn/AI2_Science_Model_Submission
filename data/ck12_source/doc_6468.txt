However, after finishing step 6, add an equal number of OH − ions to both sides of the equation.
Combine the H + and OH − to make H 2 O and cancel out any water molecules that appear on both sides.
Using the example of the oxidation of Fe 2+ ions by dichromate (Cr 2 O 7 2- ), we would get the following three steps:
Adding the hydroxide ions
14\text{OH}^-(aq)+14\text{H}^+(aq)+6\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq)+\text{Cr}_2\text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow 6\text{Fe}^{3+}+2\text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)+7\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+14\text{OH}^-(aq)
Combining the hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions to make water
14\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+6\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq)+\text{Cr}_2\text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow 6\text{Fe}^{3+}+2\text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)+7\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+14\text{OH}^-(aq)
Canceling out seven water molecules from both sides to get the final equation
7\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+6\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq)+\text{Cr}_2\text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow 6\text{Fe}^{3+}+2\text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)+14\text{OH}^-(aq)
The equation is still balanced by atoms and by charge, but the presence of hydroxide ions rather than hydrogen ions means that the reaction takes place in basic solution.
Typically, most redox reactions will actually only proceed in one type of solution or the other.
The oxidation of Fe 2+ by Cr 2 O 7 2− does not occur in basic solution, and was only balanced this way to demonstrate the method.
In summary, the choice of which balancing method to use depends on the kind of reaction.
The oxidation-number method works best if the oxidized and reduced species appear only once on each side of the equation and if no acids or bases are present.
The half-reaction method is more versatile and works well for reactions involving ions in aqueous solution.
The half-reaction method of balancing redox equations in basic solution is described.
