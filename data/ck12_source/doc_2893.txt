A template is a model provided for others to copy.
The process of constructing an mRNA molecule from DNA is known as transcription ( Figure below and Figure below ).
Transcription is similar to DNA replication, except in transcription, single stranded RNA is produced instead of double stranded DNA.
In transcription, only one strand of DNA is used as a template.
First, the double helix of DNA unwinds and an enzyme, RNA Polymerase, builds the mRNA using the DNA as a template.
The nucleotides follow basically the same base pairing rules as in DNA to form the correct sequence in the mRNA.
This time, however, uracil (U) pairs with each adenine (A) in the DNA.
For example, a DNA sequence ACGGGTAAGG will be transcribed into the mRNA sequence UGCCCAUUCC.
In this manner, the information of the DNA is passed on to the mRNA.
The mRNA will carry this code to the ribosomes to tell them how to make a protein.
As not all genes are used in every cell, a gene must be "turned on" or expressed when the gene product is needed by the cell.
Only the information in a gene that is being expressed is transcribed into an mRNA.
Overview of transcription
Transcription is when RNA is created from a DNA template.
Each gene (a) contains triplets of bases (b) that are transcribed into RNA (c).
Every triplet in the DNA, or codon in the mRNA, encodes for a unique amino acid.

Base-pairing ensures the accuracy of transcription.
Notice how the helix must unwind for transcription to take place.
The new mRNA is shown in green.
