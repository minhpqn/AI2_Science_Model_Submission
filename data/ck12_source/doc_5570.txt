Another type involves the breakdown of a compound to produce the elements that make it up.
If we pass an electric current through bauxite (aluminum oxide, the raw material for aluminum metal), we get metallic aluminum as a product.
Electrolytic production of aluminum
Electrolytic production of aluminum.
However, the vast majority of chemical changes involve one compound being transformed into another compound.
There are literally millions of possibilities when we take this approach to chemical change.
New compounds can be made to produce better fabrics that are easier to clean and maintain; they can help preserve food so it doesn’t spoil as quickly; and, we can make new medicines to treat diseases – all made possible by studying chemical change.
A chemical change produces a different materials than the ones we started with.
