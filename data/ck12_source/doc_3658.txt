What was the outcome?
State Mendel’s second law.
If a purple-flowered, short-stemmed plant is crossed with a white-flowered, long-stemmed plant, would all of the purple-flowered offspring also have short stems?
Why or why not?
Mendel's Laws and Genetics
Explain the relationship between homologous chromosomes, alleles and the locus.
Distinguish genotype from phenotype.
Define heterozygote and homozygote.
Do you look like your parents?
You probably have some characteristics or traits in common with each of your parents.
Mendel's work provided the basis to understand the passing of traits from one generation to the next.
Mendel’s Laws and Genetics
You might think that Mendel's discoveries would have made a big impact on science as soon as he made them.
But you would be wrong.
Why?
Because Mendel's work was largely ignored.
Mendel was far ahead of his time and working from a remote monastery.
He had no reputation among the scientific community and no previously published work.
Mendel’s work, titled Experiments in Plant Hybridization , was published in 1866, and sent to prominent libraries in several countries, as well as 133 natural science associations.
Mendel himself even sent carefully marked experiment kits to Karl von Nageli, the leading botanist of the day.
