According to the Aufbau process, the electrons fill the 4 s sublevel before beginning to fill the 3 d sublevel.  However, the outermost s electrons are always the first to be removed in the process of forming transition metal cations.  Because most transition metals have two valence electrons, the charge of 2+ is a very common one for their ions.  This is the case for iron above.  A half-filled d sublevel ( d 5 ) is particularly stable, which is the result of an iron atom losing a third electron.
Picture of rust, iron oxide, as well as iron sulfate
A.
Rust is a complex combination of oxides of iron(III), among them iron(III) oxide, Fe 2 O 3 .
B.
Iron(II) sulfate, FeSO 4 , has been known since ancient times as green vitriol and was used for centuries in the manufacture of inks.
Some transition metals that have relatively few d electrons may attain a noble-gas electron configuration.  Scandium is an example.
& \text{Sc} \quad \quad \rightarrow \qquad \text{Sc}^{3+} \quad + \quad 3\text{e}^-\\& [\text{Ar}]3d^14s^2 \qquad [\text{Ar}]
Others may attain configurations with a full d sublevel, such as zinc and copper.
& \text{Zn} \quad \quad \rightarrow \qquad \text{Zn}^{2+} \quad + \quad 2\text{e}^-\\& [\text{Ar}]3d^{10}4s^2 \qquad [\text{Ar}]3d^{10}\\& \text{Cu} \quad \quad \rightarrow \qquad \text{Cu}^+ \quad + \quad \text{e}^-\\& [\text{Ar}]3d^{10}4s^1 \qquad [\text{Ar}]3d^{10}
The resulting configuration above, with 18 electrons in the outermost principal energy level, is referred to as a pseudo noble-gas electron configuration .  It gives particular stability to the Zn 2+ and Cu + ions.
Transition metal ion formation is more complex than simple cation formation.
Transition metal ions often involve rearrangements of both d and s electrons.
