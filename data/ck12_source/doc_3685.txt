What are linked genes?
Explain how you would construct a linkage map for a human chromosome.
What data would you need?
People with red hair usually have very light skin.
What might be a genetic explanation for this observation?
How often does crossing-over occur between non-linked genes?
Explain your answer.
Mendelian Inheritance in Humans
Define genetic trait.
Distinguish autosomal traits from X-linked traits.
Use a pedigree to determine the mode of inheritance.
Summarize the inheritance of red-green color blindness.
What number can you see?
Red-green colorblindness is a common inherited trait in humans.
About 1 in 10 men have some form of color blindness, however, very few women are color blind.
Why?
Mendelian Inheritance in Humans
Characteristics that are encoded in DNA are called genetic traits .
Different types of human traits are inherited in different ways.
Some human traits have simple inheritance patterns like the traits that Gregor Mendel studied in pea plants.
