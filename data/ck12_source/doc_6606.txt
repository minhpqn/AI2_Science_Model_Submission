Because the active site of an enzyme has such a unique shape, only one particular substrate is capable of binding to that enzyme.
In other words, each enzyme catalyzes only one chemical reaction with only one substrate.
Once the enzyme/substrate complex is formed, the reaction occurs and the substrate is transformed into products.
Finally, the product molecule or molecules are released from the active site.
Note that the enzyme is left unaffected by the reaction and is now capable of catalyzing the reaction of another substrate molecule.
An inhibitor is a molecule which interferes with the function of an enzyme, either by slowing or stopping the chemical reaction.
Inhibitors can work in a variety of ways, but one of the most common is illustrated in the Figure below .
Diagram illustrating competitive inhibition
A competitive inhibitor is a molecule that binds to the active site of an enzyme without reacting, thus preventing the substrate from binding.
The inhibitor binds competitively at the active site and blocks the substrate from binding.
Since no reaction occurs with the inhibitor, the enzyme is prevented from catalyzing the reaction.
Cyanide is a potent poison which acts as a competitive inhibitor.
It binds to the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and interrupts cellular respiration.
The binding of the cyanide to the enzyme is irreversible and the affected organism dies quickly.
A non-competitive inhibitor does not bind at the active site.
It attaches at some other site on the enzyme and changes the shape of the protein.
This shift in three-dimensional structure alters the shape of the active site so that the substrate will no longer fit in the site properly (see Figure below ).
Diagram illustrating non-competitive inhibition
Some enzymes require the presence of a non-protein molecule called a cofactor in order to function properly.
Cofactors can be inorganic metal ions or small organic molecules.
