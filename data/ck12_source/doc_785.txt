B \ \text{is expressed in} \ \frac{Newtons}{Amp \cdot meter}  ,while q is expressed in coulombs and v  is expressed in m/s.
The unit \frac{N}{A \cdot m}  is also known as a Tesla , after the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla.
You can see that the product of these three units is Newtons, the appropriate unit for force.
F=Bqv=\frac{Newtons}{Amp \cdot meter} \cdot coulomb \cdot \frac{meter}{s} and since amperes are \frac{coulomb}{second} , amps cancels coulombs/second and meters cancels meters.
The only unit remaining is Newtons.
Again, we can determine the direction of the force acting upon the electron using a hand rule.
Since the electron has a negative charge, the left hand rule is used.
The fingers of the left hand are pointed in the direction of the magnetic field and the thumb points in the direction of the initial electron movement.
The direction of the force acting on the electron is the direction the palm of the left hand faces.
The direction of the magnetic field, the direction of the moving charge, and the direction of the force on the particle are all perpendicular to each other.
Illustration of the left hand rule
In most situations, a positive test charged is used, instead of an electron.
In these circumstances, the right hand rule  is used.
The right hand rule is the same as the left hand rule; the thumb is the direction of initial charge movement, the fingers are the direction of the field, and the palm is the direction of the acting force.
Illustration of the right hand rule for force
In dealing with the relationships that exist between magnetic fields and electric charges, there are both left hand and right hand rules that we use to indicate various directions â€“ directions of fields, directions of currents, directions of motion.
To avoid errors, it is absolutely vital to know and express whether the system we are observing is using conventional current or electron current.
This allows us to use the appropriate rule.
Example Problem:
An electron traveling at  3.0 \times 10^6 \ m/s passes through a  0.0400 \ N/amp \cdot m uniform magnetic field.
