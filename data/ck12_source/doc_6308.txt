Therefore, the order of the reaction with respect to H 2 is 1, or rate Î± [H 2 ] 1 .
Because 2^1 = 2 , the doubling of H 2 results in a rate that is twice as great.
The overall rate law then includes both of these results.
\text{rate}=k[\text{NO}]^ 2 [\text{H}_ 2]
The sum of the exponents is 2 + 1 = 3 , making the reaction third-order overall.
Once the rate law for a reaction is determined, the specific rate constant can be found by substituting the data for any of the experiments into the rate law and solving for k .
k=\frac{\text{rate}}{[\text{NO}]^2 [\text{H}_2]}=\frac{1.25 \times 10^{-5} \text{ M/s}}{(0.0050 \text{ M})^2(0.0020 \text{ M})}=250 \text{ M}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1}
Notice that the rate law for the reaction does not relate to the balanced equation for the overall reaction.
The coefficients of NO and H 2 are both 2, while the order of the reaction with respect to the H 2 is only one.
The units for the specific rate constant vary with the order of the reaction.
So far, we have seen reactions that are first or second order with respect to a given reactant.
Occasionally, the rate of a reaction may not depend on the concentration of one of the reactants at all.
In this case, the reaction is said to be zero-order with respect to that reactant.
The process of using experimental data to determine a rate law is described.
Use the site below to practice determination of rate constant with experimental data.
How do you carry out experiments for determining rate constants?
Why is the reaction order with regard to NO a value of 2?
Why is the reaction order with regard to hydrogen value of 1?
