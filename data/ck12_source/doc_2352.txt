A variable is a factor that can take on different values.
For example, the speed of an object down a ramp might be one variable, and the steepness of the ramp might be another.
There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a manipulated variable and a responding variable.
A manipulated variable is a variable that is changed by the researcher.
A manipulated variable is also called an independent variable.
A responding variable is a variable that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable changes.
A responding variable is also called a dependent variable.

Q:
If you were to do an experiment to find out what influences the speed of an object down a ramp, what would be the responding variable?
How could you measure it?
A:
The responding variable would be the speed of the object.
You could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch.
You could clock the time it takes the object to travel from the top to the bottom of the ramp.
The less time it takes, the faster the average speed down the ramp.
Q:
What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp?
A:
