It allows them to crowd out other organisms that reproduce more slowly.
Bacteria, for example, may divide several times per hour.
Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of bacterial cells in just a few hours!
However, most bacteria do not live under ideal conditions.
If they did, the entire surface of the planet would soon be covered with them.
Instead, their reproduction is kept in check by limited resources, predators, and their own wastes.
This is true of most other organisms as well.
Sexual reproduction involves two parents.
As you can see from Figure below , in sexual reproduction, parents produce reproductive cells—called gametes —that unite to form an offspring.
Gametes are haploid cells.
This means they contain only half the number of chromosomes found in other cells of the organism.
Gametes are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis , which is described in detail in a subsequent concept.
The process in which two gametes unite is called fertilization .
The fertilized cell that results is referred to as a zygote .
A zygote is diploid cell, which means that it has twice the number of chromosomes as a gamete.

Sexual reproduction involves the production of haploid gametes by meiosis.
