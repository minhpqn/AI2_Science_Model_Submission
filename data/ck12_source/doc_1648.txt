Explain the phases of the cell cycle.
Do cells have a life cycle?
Yes, just like a butterfly passes through different phases, such as caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult butterfly, there are a series of phases in a cell's life as it gets ready to divide.
The sequence of phases leading up to cell division and then ending with cell division itself is called the cell cycle.
The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully controlled.
The cell cycle ( Figure below ) is the life cycle of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle.
Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases.
The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete ).
The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase.
Interphase is the stage when the cell mostly performs its “everyday” functions.
For example, it is when a kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do.
The cell also gets ready to divide during this time.
The cell divides during the mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis.
Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions.
Interphase can be divided into three stages:
The first growth phase (G1):
During the G1 stage, the cell doubles in size and doubles the number of organelles.
The synthesis phase (S):
The DNA is replicated during this phase.
In other words, an identical copy of all the cell’s DNA is made.
