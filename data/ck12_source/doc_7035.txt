Explain what is meant by half life.
Solve problems involving radioactive decay.
Students will learn what is meant by half life and how to solve problems involving radioactive decay.
M = M_0 (\frac{1}{2})^{\frac{t}{t_H}}
The amount of mass M of the substance surviving after an original \mathit{M}_0 n uclei decay for time t with a half-life of \mathit{t}_H
t = t_H \frac{\ln{\frac{M}{M_0}}}{\ln{\frac{1}{2}}}
The amount of time t it takes a set of nuclei to decay to a specified amount.
N = N_0 exp^{-\lambda t}
The number N of nuclei surviving after an original \mathit{N}_0 n uclei decay for time t with a half-life of \mathit{t}_H .
Some of the matter on Earth is unstable and undergoing nuclear decay.
Alpha decay is the emission of a helium nucleus and causes the product to have an atomic number 2 lower than the original and an atomic mass number 4 lower than the original.
Beta minus decay is the emission of an electron, causing the product to have an atomic number 1 greater than the original
Beta plus decay is the emission of a positron, causing the product to have an atomic number 1 lower than the original.
When an atomic nucleus decays, it does so by releasing one or more particles.
