Role of the Lymphatic System in the Bodyâ€™s Defenses
The lymphatic system also plays an important role in the immune system.
For example, the lymphatic system makes white blood cells that protect the body from diseases.
Cells of the lymphatic system produce two types of white blood cells, T cells and B cells, that are involved in fighting specific pathogens.
Lymph nodes, which are scattered throughout the lymphatic system, act as filters or traps for foreign particles and are important in the proper functioning of the immune system.
The role of the lymphatic system in the immune response is discussed in additional concepts.
The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to return body fluids to the blood.
The lymph, the clear liquid found in the lymphatic system, is moved along in the lymph vessels by the squeezing action of smooth muscles and skeletal muscles.
