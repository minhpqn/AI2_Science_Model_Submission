An object is 2.0 m in front of a plane mirror.
Its image is:
virtual, inverted, and 2.0 m behind the mirror.
virtual, inverted, and 2.0 m in front of the mirror.
virtual, erect, and 2.0 m in front of the mirror.
real, erect, and 2.0 m behind the mirror.
virtual, erect, and 2.0 m behind the mirror.
If the angle of incidence for an object and a plane mirror is 30Â°, what is the angle between the object and its image?
