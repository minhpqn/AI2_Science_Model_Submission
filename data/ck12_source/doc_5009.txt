In animals, an important function of enzymes is to help digest food.
Digestive enzymes speed up reactions that break down large molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules the body can use.
Without digestive enzymes, animals would not be able to break down food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they need to survive.
active site :
Site on the enzyme where the reaction occurs.
biochemical reaction :
Chemical reaction within a cell or organism; usually controlled by an enzyme.
enzyme :
Chemical, usually a protein, that speeds up chemical reactions in organisms; a biological catalyst.
pepsin :
The main digestive enzyme in the stomach; degrades food proteins into peptides.
reactant :
Substance involved in a chemical reaction that is present at the beginning of the reaction.
substrates :
The reactants in an enzyme catalyzed reaction.
trypsin :
Digestive enzyme which break protein chains in food into smaller peptide fragments; a serine protease, cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline.
Enzymes are needed to speed up chemical reactions in organisms.
They work by lowering the activation energy of reactions.
Enzymes position substrates into active sites.
