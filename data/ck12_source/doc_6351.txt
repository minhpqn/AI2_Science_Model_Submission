If the value of the ion product is less than the value of the K_{sp} , then the solution will remain unsaturated.
No precipitate will form because the concentrations are not high enough to begin the precipitation process.
If the value of the ion product is greater than the value of the K_{sp} , then a precipitate will form.
The formation of the precipitate lowers the concentration of each of the ions until the ion product is exactly equal to the K_{sp} , at which point precipitation ceases.

Sample Problem:
Predicting Precipitates
Will a precipitate of barium sulfate form when 10.0 mL of 0.0050 M BaCl 2 is mixed with 20.0 mL of 0.0020 M Na 2 SO 4 ?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem .
concentration of BaCl 2 = 0.0050 M
volume of BaCl 2 = 10.0 mL
concentration of Na 2 SO 4 = 0.0020 M
volume of Na 2 SO 4 = 20.0 mL
K_{sp} of BaSO 4 = 1.1 × 10 -10
ion product [Ba 2+ ][SO 4 2- ]
if a precipitate forms
The concentration and volume of each solution that is mixed together must be used to calculate the [Ba 2+ ] and the [SO 4 2− ].
Each individual solution is diluted when they are mixed together.
