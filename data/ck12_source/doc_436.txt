An alveoli is lined with capillaries that promote gas exchange
During respiration, oxygen gets pulled into the lungs and enters the blood by passing across the thin alveoli membranes and into the capillaries.
The alveoli are at the end of the long air passages.
Breathing and Respiration
The process of getting oxygen into the body and releasing carbon dioxide is called respiration .
Sometimes breathing is called respiration, but there is much more to respiration than just breathing.
Breathing is only the movement of oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the body.
