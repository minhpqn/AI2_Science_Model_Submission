One coil is called the primary coil and the other is called the secondary coil.
The varying magnetic field induces a varying EMF in the secondary coil.
The EMF induced in the secondary coil is called the secondary voltage and is proportional to the primary voltage.
The secondary voltage also depends on the ratio of turns on the secondary coil to turns on the primary coil.
\frac{\text{secondary voltage}}{\text{primary voltage}}=\frac{\text{number of turns on secondary}}{\text{number of turns on primary}}
