That's what Mendel asked.
He noticed peas were always round or wrinkled, but never anything else.
Seed shape was one of the traits Mendel studied in his first set of experiments.
Mendel’s First Set of Experiments
Mendel first experimented with just one characteristic of a pea plant at a time.
He began with flower color.
As shown in Figure below , Mendel cross-pollinated purple- and white-flowered parent plants.
The parent plants in the experiments are referred to as the P (for parent) generation .

Parental, F1, and F2 generations of peas
This diagram shows Mendel's first experiment with pea plants.
The F1 generation results from cross-pollination of two parent (P) plants, and contained all purple flowers.
The F2 generation results from self-pollination of F1 plants, and contained 75% purple flowers and 25% white flowers.
This type of experiment is known as a monohybrid cross.
F1 and F2 Generations
The offspring of the P generation are called the F1 (for filial, or “offspring”) generation .
As you can see from Figure above , all of the plants in the F1 generation had purple flowers.
None of them had white flowers.
Mendel wondered what had happened to the white-flower characteristic.
He assumed some type of inherited factor produces white flowers and some other inherited factor produces purple flowers.
