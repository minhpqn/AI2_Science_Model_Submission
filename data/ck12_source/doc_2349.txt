This statement may or may not be true, but it is not a scientific hypothesis.
That’s because it can’t be tested.
Given the nature of the hypothesis, there are no observations a scientist could make to test whether or not it is false.
A Scientific Hypothesis Must Be Falsifiable
A hypothesis may be testable, but even that isn’t enough for it to be a scientific hypothesis.
In addition, it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false.
Consider this statement:
“There are other planets in the universe where life exists.”
This statement is testable.
If it is true, it is at least theoretically possible to find evidence showing that it’s true.
For example, a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe and report back if it discovers an inhabited planet.
If such a planet were found, it would prove the statement is true.
However, the statement isn’t a scientific hypothesis.
Why?
If it is false, it’s not possible to show that it’s false.
The spacecraft may never find an inhabited planet, but that doesn't necessarily mean there isn’t one.
Given the vastness of the universe, we would never be able to check every planet for life!
Both Testable and Falsifiable
Let’s consider one last example, which is illustrated in the Figure below :
"Any two objects dropped at the same time from the same height will reach the ground at the same time (assuming the absence of air resistance)."
