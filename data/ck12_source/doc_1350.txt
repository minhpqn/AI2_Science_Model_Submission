Is Earth the only planet to have volcanoes?
On Earth, active volcanoes are found on all continents except Australia.
Volcanoes even erupt under the ice on Antarctica!
Volcanoes are also common elsewhere in the solar system.
In fact, the biggest volcano is on Mars.
This image is of Olympus Mons, which is a shield volcano.
Olympus Mons is three times the height of Mt.
Everest.
But its slopes are very gentle.
A volcano is a vent from which the material from a magma chamber escapes.
This may include lava, rock fragments, ash, and gases.
Volcanic eruptions can come from many types of structures.
Most people think of volcanoes as large, peaky cones.
But volcanoes can be large and broad, or tiny little cones.
Volcanic eruptions can come from fractured domes, a vent in the ground, or from a giant hole in the ground.
