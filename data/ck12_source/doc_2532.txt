Atoms of solids, in contrast, stick together, so they cannot move apart.
Differences in the weight of matter, he argued, could be explained by the closeness of atoms.
Atoms of lighter matter, he thought, were more spread out and separated by more empty space.
Q:
Democritus thought that different kinds of atoms make up different types of matter.
How is this similar to modern ideas about atoms?
A:
The modern view is that atoms of different elements differ in their numbers of protons and electrons and this gives them different physical and chemical properties.
Democritus was an important philosopher, but he was less influential than another Greek philosopher named Aristotle, who lived about 100 years after Democritus.
Aristotle rejected Democritus’ idea of the atom.
In fact, Aristotle thought the idea was ridiculous.
Unfortunately, Aristotle’s opinion was accepted for more than 2000 years, and Democritus’ idea was more or less forgotten.
However, the idea of the atom was revived around 1800 by the English scientist John Dalton.
Dalton developed an entire theory about the atom, much of which is still accepted today.
He based his theory on experimental evidence, not on lucky guesses.
Around 400 B.C.E., the Greek philosopher Democritus introduced the idea of the atom as the basic building block matter.
Democritus thought that atoms are tiny, uncuttable, solid particles that are surrounded by empty space and constantly moving at random.
Democritus surmised that different kinds of matter consist of different types or arrangements of atoms.

Relate your hypothesis to Democritus’ ideas about atoms.
