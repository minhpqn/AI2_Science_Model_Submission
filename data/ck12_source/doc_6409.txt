What is the percent ionization in a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid?
Which is the stronger acid:
HF or benzoic acid?
acid ionization constant (K_a) :
The equilibrium constant for the ionization of an acid.
strong acid:
An acid that is completely ionized in aqueous solution.
weak acid:
An acid that ionizes only slightly in aqueous solution.
Strong and Weak Bases and Base Ionization Constant (Kb)
Define strong and weak bases.
Give examples of strong and weak bases.
Write the expression for the base ionization constant.
Ammonia is a weak base with many applications
Ammonia for what?
All the complex electronics and apparatus in a space shuttle generate heat, as do the astronauts.
The shuttles have a complex arrangement of systems to dissipate that heat into outer space.
One of the components of this system is a series of coils filled with ammonia that are located on the outside of the shuttle.
Ammonia absorbs the heat and then releases it into space as the gas circulates through the coils.
