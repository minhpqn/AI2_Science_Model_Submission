The nutrient-rich water that comes to the surface by upwelling supports many living things.
An animation of upwelling is seen here:
Upwelling also takes place along the Equator.
Winds blow the surface water north and south.
This leaves a void that deep water can upwell into.
The nutrients rise to the surface and support a great deal of life in the equatorial oceans.
Cooling or evaporation of fresh water from the sea surface makes surface water dense.
This causes the surface water to undergo downwelling.
Downwelling of cold, dense water pushes deep water along.
This drives thermohaline circulation.
Upwelling takes place at some coastlines or along the Equator.
Upwelling brings cool, nutrient-rich water to the surface.
