Einstein’s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today, although Newton’s law is still used for many calculations.

Curvature of space and time
This diagram shows how Earth’s mass bends the “fabric” of space and time around it, causing smaller objects such as satellites to move toward Earth.
Newton’s law of gravity can predict the motion of most but not all objects.
It also doesn’t explain gravity.
It only describes its effects on the motion of objects.
Einstein showed mathematically that gravity is not really a force of attraction between all objects with mass, as Newton thought.
Instead, gravity is a result of the warping of space-time.
Einstein’s ideas have been supported by evidence and are widely accepted today.

Then decide whether the statements below about Einstein and his work are true or false.
Einstein’s theory of general relativity is considered his greatest triumph.
Einstein was award a Nobel prize for his theory of general relativity.
Einstein’s ideas about gravity are just a theory and have no practical use.
Einstein’s thought that all universal laws could be expressed in mathematics.
General relativity is the basis of our understanding of the universe today.
