These are the same percentages that Mendel got in his first experiment.
Determining Missing Genotypes
A Punnett square can also be used to determine a missing genotype based on the other genotypes involved in a cross.
Suppose you have a parent plant with purple flowers and a parent plant with white flowers.
Because the b allele is recessive, you know that the white-flowered parent must have the genotype bb .
The purple-flowered parent, on the other hand, could have either the BB or the Bb genotype.
The Punnett square in Figure below shows this cross.
The question marks (?) in the chart could be either B or b alleles.
Test cross with a Punnett square
Punnett Square:
Cross Between White-Flowered and Purple-Flowered Pea Plants.
This Punnett square shows a cross between a white-flowered pea plant and a purple-flowered pea plant.
Can you fill in the missing alleles?
What do you need to know about the offspring to complete their genotypes?
Can you tell what the genotype of the purple-flowered parent is from the information in the Punnett square?
No; you also need to know the genotypes of the offspring in row 2.
What if you found out that two of the four offspring have white flowers?
Now you know that the offspring in the second row must have the bb genotype.
One of their b alleles obviously comes from the white-flowered ( bb ) parent, because thatâ€™s the only allele this parent has.
The other b allele must come from the purple-flowered parent.
