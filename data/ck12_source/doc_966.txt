For energy level 2, the maximum number of electrons is 8 (2 \times 2^2) , and for the 3rd energy level, the maximum number of electrons is 18 (2 \times 3^2) .
The Table below lists the number of sub-levels and electrons for the first four principal quantum numbers.

Total Number of Electrons
The largest known atom contains slightly more than 100 electrons.
Quantum mechanics sets no limit as to how many energy levels exist, but no more than 7 principal energy levels are needed to describe all the electrons of all the known atoms.
Each energy level can have as many sub-levels as the principal quantum number, as discussed above, and each sub-level is identified by a letter.
Beginning with the lowest energy sub-level, the sub-levels are identified by the letters s , p , d , f , g , h , i , and so on.
Every energy level will have an  s sub-level, but only energy levels 2 and above will have  p sub-levels.
Similarly,  d sub-levels occur in energy level 3 and above, and  f sub-levels occur in energy level 4 and above.
Energy level 5 could have a fifth sub-energy level named g , but all the known atoms can have their electrons described without ever using the g sub-level.
Therefore, we often say there are only four sub-energy levels, although theoretically there can be more than four sub-levels.
The principal energy levels and sub-levels are shown in the following diagram.
The principal energy levels and sub-levels that we use to describe electrons are in red.
The energy levels and sub-levels in black are theoretically present but are never used for known atoms.
Diagram of the principal energy levels and sublevels
The sub-energy levels are identified by the azimuthal quantum number, l .
When the azimuthal quantum number l=0 , the sub-level = s .
