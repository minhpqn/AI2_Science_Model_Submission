Cutting the Cheese
Democritus lived in Greece from about 460 to 370 B.C.E.
Like many other ancient Greek philosophers, he spent a lot of time wondering about the natural world.
Democritus wondered, for example, what would happen if you cut a chunk of matter—such as a piece of cheese into smaller and smaller pieces.
He thought that a point would be reached at which the cheese could not be cut into still smaller pieces.
He called these pieces atomos , which means “uncuttable” in Greek.
This is where the modern term atom comes from.
In the video at the following URL, Bill Nye the Science Guy demonstrates how Democritus arrived at his idea of the atom.
