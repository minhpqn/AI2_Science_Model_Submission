Ramp Forces and Motion (PhET Simulation)
Nathan pulls his little brother in a wagon, using a rope inclined at 30^\circ above the horizontal.
The wagon and brother have a total mass of 80 kg, the average coefficient of friction between the wagon wheels and the floor is 0.08, and Nathan pulls on the rope with a force of 100 N.
Draw a force diagram for the wagon, labeling all forces.
Calculate the horizontal and vertical components of Nathanâ€™s pull.
Label them on your diagram (use dotted lines for components so as not to confuse them with other forces).
Calculate the normal force acting on the wagon. (HINT:
It is NOT equal to the weight!
Use your FBD above).
Calculate the force of friction on the wagon.
Calculate the horizontal acceleration of the wagon.
When the 20 kg box to the right is pulled with a force of 100 N, it just starts to move (i.e. the maximum value of static friction is overcome with a force of 100 N).
What is the value of the coefficient of static friction, \mu_S ?
A different box, this time 5 kg in mass, is being pulled with a force of 20 N and is sliding with an acceleration of 2 \ m/s^2 .
Find the coefficient of kinetic friction, \mu_K .
The large box on the table is 30 \;\mathrm{kg} and is connected via a rope and pulley to a smaller 10 \;\mathrm{kg} box, which is hanging.
The 10 \;\mathrm{kg} mass is the highest mass you can hang without moving the box on the table.
Find the coefficient of static friction \mu_S .
A block has a little block hanging out to its side, as shown:
As you know, if the situation is left like this, the little block will just fall.
