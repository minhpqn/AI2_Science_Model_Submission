This is reflected in the chemical equation for the reaction.
The equation should be balanced.
In a balanced equation, the same number of atoms of a given element appear on each side of the arrow.
For example, in the equation above, there are four hydrogen atoms on each side of the arrow.
Types of Chemical Reactions
In general, a chemical reaction involves the breaking and forming of chemical bonds.
In the methane reaction above, bonds are broken in methane and oxygen, and bonds are formed in carbon dioxide and water.
A reaction like this, in which a compound or element burns in oxygen, is called a combustion reaction .
This is just one of many possible types of chemical reactions.
Other types of chemical reactions include synthesis, decomposition, and substitution reactions.
A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more chemical elements or compounds unite to form a more complex product.
For example, nitrogen (N 2 ) and hydrogen (H 2 ) unite to form ammonia (NH 3 ):
N 2 + 3 H 2 → 2 NH 3 .
A decomposition reaction occurs when a compound is broken down into smaller compounds or elements.
For example, water (H 2 O) breaks down into hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ):
2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + O 2 .
A substitution reaction occurs when one element replaces another element in a compound.
For example, sodium (Na + ) replaces hydrogen (H) in hydrochloric acid (HCl), producing sodium chloride (NaCl) and hydrogen gas (H 2 ):
2 Na + + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H 2 .
Reduction-oxidation reactions, or redox reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed.
