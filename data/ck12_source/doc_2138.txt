Reduce the amount of hazardous products you buy.
For example, if you only need a quart of paint for a job, don’t buy a gallon.
Use less hazardous products if you can.
For example, clean windows with vinegar and water instead of toxic window cleaners.
Reuse products if it’s safe to do so.
For example, paint thinner that has been used to clean paint brushes can be strained and reused.
Recycle whenever possible.
For example, some service stations allow you to drop off used motor oil, car batteries, or tires for recycling.
Always properly dispose of hazardous waste.
For example, let liquid waste evaporate before placing the container in the trash.
Proper disposal depends on the waste.
Many hazardous products have disposal guidelines on the label.
That’s one reason why you should keep the products in their original containers.
The labels also explain how to use the products safely.
Follow the instructions to protect yourself and the environment.
Most communities have centers for disposing of household hazardous waste ( Figure below ).
