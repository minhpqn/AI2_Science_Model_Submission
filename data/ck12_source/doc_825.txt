This energy then flows through the ecosystem, passed from producers to consumers .
Plants are producers in many ecosystems.
Energy flows from plants to the herbivores that eat the plants, and then to carnivores that eat the herbivores.
The flow of energy depicts interactions of organisms within an ecosystem.
Matter is also recycled in ecosystems.
Biogeochemical cycles recycle nutrients, like carbon and nitrogen, so they are always available.
These nutrients are used over and over again by organisms.
Water is also continuously recycled.
The flow of energy and the recycling of nutrients and water are examples of the interactions between organisms and the interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem.
An ecosystem consists of all the living things and nonliving things interacting in the same area.
Matter is also recycled in ecosystems; recycling of nutrients is important so they can always be available
