The nucleus can be described as the "information center," containing the instructions (DNA) for making all the proteins in a cell, as well as how much of each protein to make.
The nucleus is also the main distinguishing feature between the two general categories of cell, with cells known as prokaryotic lacking a nucleus.
Although the cells of different organisms are built differently, they all have certain general functions.
Every cell must get energy from food, be able to grow and divide, and respond to its environment.
More about cell structure and function will be discussed in additional concepts.

These cells show the characteristic nucleus.
A few smaller cells are also visible.

Living Organisms Respond to their Environment
All living organisms are able to react to something important or interesting in their external environment.
For example, living organisms constantly respond to their environment.
They respond to changes in light, heat, sound, and chemical and mechanical contact.
Organisms have means for receiving information, such as eyes, ears, taste buds, or other structures.
Living Things Grow and Reproduce
All living things reproduce to make the next generation.
Organisms that do not reproduce will go extinct.
As a result, there are no species that do not reproduce ( Figure below ).
