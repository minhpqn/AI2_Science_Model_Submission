This in turn decreases the pressure and provides a relief to the original stress of a pressure increase.
An increase in pressure on an equilibrium system favors the reaction which produces fewer total moles of gas.
In this case, it is the forward reaction that is favored.
A decrease in pressure on the above system could be achieved by pulling the piston outward, increasing the container volume.
The equilibrium would respond by favoring the reverse reaction in which NH 3 decomposes to N 2 and H 2 .
This is because the overall number of gas molecules would increases and so would the pressure.
A decrease in pressure on an equilibrium system favors the reaction which produces more total moles of gas.
This is summarized in the Table below .
reaction produces fewer gas molecules
reaction produces more gas molecules
Like changes in concentration, the  K_{eq} value for a given reaction is unchanged by a change in pressure.
It is important to remember when analyzing the effect of a pressure change on equilibrium that only gases are affected.
If a certain reaction involves liquids or solids, they should be ignored.
Calcium carbonate decomposes according to the equilibrium reaction:
\text{CaCO}_3(s) \rightleftarrows \text{CaO}(s)+\text{O}_2(g)
Oxygen is the only gas in the system.
An increase in the pressure of the system slows the rate of decomposition of CaCO 3 because the reverse reaction is favored.
When a system contains equal moles of gas on both sides of the equation, pressure has no effect on the equilibrium position, as in the formation of HCl from H 2 and Cl 2 .
\text{H}_2(g)+\text{Cl}_2(g) \rightleftarrows 2\text{HCl}(g)
The influence of pressure on an equilibrium system is described.
