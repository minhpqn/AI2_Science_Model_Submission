Describe the characteristics of Mercury.
What does this planet look like?
Mercury looks a lot like Earth's Moon.
Why do you think it does?
Both have been struck by a lot of asteroids.
Both have no atmosphere, so there is no weathering and erosion.
If they had an atmosphere, many of the craters would have been eroded away.
Both have no plate tectonics to transform the landscape.
This would also remove a lot of craters.
Mercury is the smallest planet.
It has no moon.
It is also the planet closest to the Sun.
Pictured below is the surface of Mercury covered with craters ( Figure below ), like Earthâ€™s Moon.
Many of the impact craters are billions of years old.
