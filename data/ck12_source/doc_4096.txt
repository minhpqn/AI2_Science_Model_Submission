The white fur of the Arctic hares may make it more difficult for fox and other predators to locate hares against the white snow.
Why So Many Species?
Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet.
But why are there so many?
Different species are well-adapted to live and survive in many different types of environments.
As environments change over time, organisms must constantly adapt to those environments.
Diversity of species increases the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment.
For example, if a natural disaster kills all of the large organisms on the planet, then the small organisms will continue to survive.
Evolution occurs by natural selection, the process by which organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers.
Evolution is due to differences in the survival and reproduction of individuals within a population.
Natural selection occurs when there is some variation in the inherited traits, some of these traits will give individuals an advantage over others, and the individuals with certain traits will be more likely to have more offspring.
