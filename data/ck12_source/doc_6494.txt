The production of sodium hydroxide is extremely electricity intensive
A big electric bill
Production of NaOH is an important industrial process.
Three different methods are employed, all of which involve the use of electricity.
When calculating the price of sodium hydroxide a company has to charge in order to make a profit, the cost of electricity has to be factored in.
To make a metric ton of NaOH, between 3300-5000 kWh (kilowatt hours) are required.
Compare that with the power needed to run an average house.
You could power a home for 6-10 months with the same amount of electricity.
Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride
Molten (liquid) sodium chloride can be electrolyzed to produce sodium metal and chlorine gas.
The electrolytic cell used in the process is called a Down’s cell (see Figure below ).
Structure of a Down's Cell, which is used to electrolyze sodium chloride
A Down’s cell is used for the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride.
In a Down’s cell, the liquid sodium ions are reduced at the cathode to liquid sodium metal.
At the anode, liquid chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine gas.
The reactions and cell potentials are shown below:
& \text{oxidation (anode):} && 2\text{Cl}^-(l) \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(g) + 2e^- && E^0 =-1.36 \text{ V} \\& \text{reduction (cathode):} && \text{Na}^+ (l) + e^- \rightarrow \text{Na}(l) && E^0 = -2.71 \text{ V} \\\hline& \text{overall reaction:} && 2\text{Na}^+(l) + 2\text{Cl}^-(l) \rightarrow 2\text{Na} (l) + \text{Cl}_2(g) && E^0{_\text{cell}} = -4.07 \text{ V}
The battery must supply over 4 volts to carry out this electrolysis.
This reaction is a major source of production of chlorine gas and is the only way to obtain pure sodium metal.
Chlorine gas is widely used in cleaning, disinfecting, and in swimming pools.
