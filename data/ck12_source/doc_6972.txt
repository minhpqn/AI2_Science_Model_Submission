A switch is flipped connecting the circuit to a 12 V battery.
How long until the capacitor has 2/3 of the total charge across it?
How long until the capacitor has 99% of the total charge across it?
What is the total charge possible on the capacitor?
Will it ever reach the full charge in part c.?
Derive the formula for V(t) across the capacitor.
Draw the graph of V vs. t for the capacitor.
Draw the graph of V vs. t for the resistor.
If you have a 39 \mu \mathrm{F} capacitor and want a time constant of 5 seconds, what resistor value is needed?
Answers to Selected Problems
a. 0 V b. 10 V
3.3 \;\mathrm{F} b. 54 \ \Omega
a. 0.43 seconds b. 1.8 seconds c.  4.7 \times 10^{-4} \text{C} d.
No, it will asymptotically approach it. e.
The graph is same shape as the Q(t) graph.
It will rise rapidly and then tail off asymptotically towards 12 V. f.
The voltage across the resistor is 12 V minus the voltage across the capacitor.
Thus, it exponentially decreases approaching the asymptote of 0 V.
about 128 \text{k} \Omega
