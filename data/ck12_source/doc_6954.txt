Find the direction and magnitude of the force on the car.
If the car has a mass of 2050 \;\mathrm{kg} , what is its velocity after 10 \;\mathrm{s} , assuming it starts at rest?
If you want double the force for the same magnetic field, how should the current change?
A horizontal wire carries a current of 48\;\mathrm{A} towards the east.
A second wire with mass 0.05 \;\mathrm{kg} runs parallel to the first, but lies 15 \;\mathrm{cm} below it.
This second wire is held in suspension by the magnetic field of the first wire above it.
If each wire has a length of half a meter, what is the magnitude and direction of the current in the lower wire?
Show that the formula for the force between two current carrying wires is  F = \frac {\mu_{o} L i_1 i_2} {2 \pi d}  , where d is the distance between the two wires,  i_1  is the current of first wire and L is the segment of length of the second wire carrying a current  i_2  . (Hint: find magnetic field emanating from first wire and then use the formula for a wire immersed in that magnetic field in order to find the force on the second wire.)
Two long thin wires are on the same plane but perpendicular to each other.
The wire on the y- axis carries a current of 6.0 \;\mathrm{A} in the -y direction.
The wire on the x- axis carries a current of 2.0 \;\mathrm{A} in the + x direction.

A long straight wire is on the x- axis and has a current of 12 \;\mathrm{A} in the -x direction.
