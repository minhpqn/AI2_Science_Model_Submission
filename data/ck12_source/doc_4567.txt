The tongue helps mix the food with saliva and also helps you swallow.
After you swallow, the chewed food passes into the pharynx.
Teeth are important for mechanical digestion.
From the pharynx, the food moves into the esophagus.
The esophagus is a long, narrow tube that passes food from the pharynx to the stomach by peristalsis.
The esophagus has no other digestive functions.
At the end of the esophagus, a muscle called a sphincter controls the entrance to the stomach.
The sphincter opens to let food into the stomach and then closes again to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus.
The stomach is a sac-like organ in which food is further digested both mechanically and chemically. (To see an animation of how the stomach digests food, go to the link below.) Churning movements of the stomachâ€™s thick, muscular walls complete the mechanical breakdown of food.
The churning movements also mix food with digestive fluids secreted by the stomach.
One of these fluids is hydrochloric acid.
It kills bacteria in food and gives the stomach the low (acidic) pH needed by digestive enzymes that work in the stomach.
The main enzyme is pepsin , which chemically digests protein.

The stomach stores the partly digested food until the small intestine is ready to receive it.
When the small intestine is empty, a sphincter opens to allow the partially digested food to enter the small intestine.
The following interactive animation demonstrates the processes that occur in the stomach.

Digestion consists of mechanical and chemical digestion.
