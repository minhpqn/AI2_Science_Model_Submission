Describe gamma rays.
State how and why gamma decay occurs.
Explain why gamma rays are the most harmful type of radiation.
This stunning image is an artist’s rendition of a gamma ray burst.
A gamma ray burst is a sudden, intense flash of gamma rays given off by an extremely energetic explosion.
The bursts have been observed in distant galaxies.
But gamma rays also occur on Earth.
What Are Gamma Rays?
Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves.
Electromagnetic waves are waves of electric and magnetic energy that travel through space at the speed of light.
The energy travels in tiny “packets” of energy, called photons.
Photons of gamma energy are called gamma particles.
Other electromagnetic waves include microwaves, light rays, and X rays.
Gamma rays have the greatest amount of energy of all electromagnetic waves.

Gamma Rays and Radioactive Decay
Gamma rays are produced when radioactive elements decay.
Radioactive elements are elements with unstable nuclei.
To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay.
