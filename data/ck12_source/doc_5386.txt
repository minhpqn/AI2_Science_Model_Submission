Duplication: the blue segment has been duplicated;
Inversions: the blue segment has been reversed;
Insertion: the yellow segment has been removed from chromosome 4 and placed into chromosome 20;
Translocation: a green segment from chromosome 4 has been exchanged with a red segment from chromosome 20.
As the name implies, point mutations occur at a single site within the DNA.
The example from Protein Synthesis:
The Genetic Code (Advanced) concept demonstrates this mutation:
THE BIG FAT CAT ATE THE RED RAT.
A change at any one position could result in a sequence that does not make sense.
Such as the C to A change shown here
THE BIG FAT AAT ATE THE RED RAT.
As shown above, point mutations exchange one nucleotide for another and are known as base substitution mutations.
These mutations are often caused either by chemicals or by a mistake during DNA replication.
A transition exchanges a purine for a purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T), and is the most common point mutation.
Less common is a transversion , which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T ↔ A/G).
Point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene are classified by the effect on the resulting protein:
mutated codon codes for the same amino acid
CAA (glutamine) → CAG (glutamine)
mutated codon codes for a different amino acid
CAA (glutamine) → CCA (proline)
