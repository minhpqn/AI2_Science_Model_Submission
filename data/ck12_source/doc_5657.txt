Thomson's plum pudding model
The “plum pudding” model.
However, this model of the atom soon gave way to a new model developed by New Zealander Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) about five years later.  Thomson did still receive many honors during his lifetime, including being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 and a knighthood in 1908.
A model gives an idea of what something looks like, but is not the real thing.
The “plum pudding” model of the atom consisted of a uniform sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in the sphere.

atomic model:
When scientists set out to design a model of what they believed the atom could look like, the goal of each atomic model was to accurately represent all of the experimental evidence about atoms in the simplest way possible.
