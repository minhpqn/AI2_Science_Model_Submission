Some falls directly into them as precipitation.
Some enters as runoff and some from streams and rivers.
Water leaves ponds and lakes through evaporation and also as outflow.
How Lakes Form
The depression that allows water to collect to form a lake may come about in a variety of ways.
The Great Lakes, for example, are glacial lakes.
A glacial lake forms when a glacier scrapes a large hole in the ground.
When the glacier melts, the water fills the hole and forms a lake.
A kettle lake forms in the sediment left by a glacier when a block of ice melts.
Kettle lakes are found where continental glaciers once covered the land ( Figure ' below ).
Over time lakes get water from rain, streams, and groundwater coming to the surface.

Other lakes are crater lakes or rift lakes ( Figure below ).
Crater lakes form when volcanic eruptions create craters that fill with water.
Rift lakes form when movements of tectonic plates create low places that fill with water.
Craters and rifts become lakes when they fill with water
