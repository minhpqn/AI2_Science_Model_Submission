The red star in the upper left is Betelgeuse (pronounced BET-ul-juice).
The blue star in the lower right is Rigel.
The fuzzy patch in the sword is the Orion nebula.
The nebula will be discussed in the concept "Star Formation."
With a quick look, stars look the same.
Look closer, though, and you can see differences.
The most obvious differences are in size and color.
Color and Temperature
Think about the coil of an electric stove as it heats up.
The coil changes in color as its temperature rises.
When you first turn on the heat, the coil looks black.
The air a few inches above the coil begins to feel warm.
As the coil gets hotter, it starts to glow a dull red.
As it gets even hotter, it becomes a brighter red.
Next it turns orange.
If it gets extremely hot, it might look yellow-white, or even blue-white.
Like a coil on a stove, a star’s color is determined by the temperature of the star’s surface.
Relatively cool stars are red.
Warmer stars are orange or yellow.
Extremely hot stars are blue or blue-white.
