This will be resolved by the balancing method.
Step 2:
Write separate half-reactions for the oxidation and the reduction processes .
Determine the oxidation numbers first, if necessary.
& \text{Oxidation:} \ \text{Fe}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+}(aq) \\& \text{Reduction:} \ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{+6}}{}}{\text{Cr}_2} \ \text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow \text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)
Step 3:
Balance the atoms in the half-reactions other than the hydrogen and oxygen .
In the oxidation half-reaction above, the iron atoms are already balanced.
The reduction half-reaction needs to be balanced with the chromium atoms.
\text{Cr}_2\text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)
Step 4:
Balance oxygen atoms by adding water molecules to the appropriate side of the equation .
For the reduction half-reaction above, seven H 2 O molecules will be added to the product side.
\text{Cr}_2\text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)+7\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
Now the hydrogen atoms need to be balanced.
In an acidic medium, add hydrogen ions to balance .
In this example, fourteen H + ions will be added to the reactant side.
14\text{H}^+(aq)+\text{Cr}_2\text{O}^{2-}_7(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{Cr}^{3+}(aq)+7\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
Step 5:
Balance the charges by adding electrons to each half-reaction .
