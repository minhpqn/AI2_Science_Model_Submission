Types of Soils
For soil scientists, there are thousands of types of soil!
Soil scientists put soils into very specific groups with certain characteristics.
Each soil type has its own name.

In these forests, trees lose their leaves each winter.
Deciduous trees need lots of rain — at least 65 cm of rainfall per year.
Deciduous forests are common in the temperate, eastern United States.
The type of soil found in a deciduous forest is a pedalfer ( Figure below ).
This type of soil is usually dark brown or black in color and very fertile.
The soil beneath a deciduous forest is a pedalfer, which are very fertile
