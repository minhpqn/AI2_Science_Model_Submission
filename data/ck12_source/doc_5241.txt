Complex Forms of Heredity
Traits that are affected by more than one gene are called polygenic traits .
The genes that affect a polygenic trait may be closely linked on a chromosome, unlinked on a chromosome, or on different chromosomes.
Polygenic traits are often difficult for geneticists to track because the polygenic trait may have many alleles.
Also, independent assortment ensures the genes combine differently in gametes.
Therefore, many different intermediate phenotypes exist in offspring.
Eye color ( Figure below ), and skin color are examples of polygenic traits in humans.
Eye color and skin color are examples of polygenic traits; they are influenced by more than one gene.
When three or more alleles determine a trait, the trait is said to have multiple alleles .
The human ABO blood group is controlled by a single gene with three alleles: the dominant I A and I B , and the recessive i allele.
The gene encodes an enzyme that affects carbohydrates that are found on the surface of the red blood cell.
