They direct the uptake of minerals from the blood and the release of minerals back into the blood as needed.
Osteoclasts dissolve minerals in bone matrix and release them back into the blood.
Bones are far from static, or unchanging.
Instead, they are dynamic, living tissues that are constantly being reshaped.
Under the direction of osteocytes, osteoblasts continuously build up bone, while osteoclasts continuously break it down.

Bones consist of different types of tissue, including compact bone, spongy bone, bone marrow, and periosteum.
All of these tissue types are shown in Figure below .
Compact bone makes up the dense outer layer of bone.
Its functional unit is the osteon .
Compact bone is very hard and strong.
Spongy bone is found inside bones and is lighter and less dense than compact bone.
This is because spongy bone is porous.
Bone marrow is a soft connective tissue that produces blood cells.
It is found inside the pores of spongy bone.
Periosteum is a tough, fibrous membrane that covers and protects the outer surfaces of bone.
Types of tissue in bone
This bone contains different types of bone tissue.
How does each type of tissue contribute to the functions of bone?
