The addition of RNA nucleotides to the growing RNA transcript during transcription; also refers to the process during translation of adding additional amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain.
initiation :
The start of transcription; signaled by the transcription initiation complex formed by the promoter, transcription factors, and RNA polymerase; also refers to the start of translation.
polyadenylation :
The addition of a string of adenines to the mRNAs 3â€™-end; signals the termination of translation in eukaryotes.
preinitiation complex :
A large complex of proteins that is necessary for the transcription of protein-coding genes in eukaryotes; helps position RNA polymerase II; also found in archaea genes.
promoter :
A segment of DNA that allows a gene to be transcribed; segment where RNA polymerase binds to start transcription.
repressor :
A protein that binds to non-coding sequences on the DNA (operator) that are close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand.
Rho-dependent termination :
Involves a protein factor (Rho), which destabilizes the RNA-DNA hybrid, releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex.
RNA polymerase II :
The enzyme that reads a template strand of DNA during transcription to synthesize the complementary RNA strand.
TATA box :
A cis -regulatory element found in the promoter of most eukaryotic genes; when the appropriate cellular signals are present, RNA polymerase binds to the TATA box, completing the initiation complex.
termination :
The end of transcription; involves the detachment of the RNA from the DNA template; also refers to the end of translation when the ribosome comes to one of the three stop codons, for which there is no tRNA.
