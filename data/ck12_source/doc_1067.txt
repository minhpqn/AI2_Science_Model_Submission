Lines of latitude and longitude on a map
Lines of latitude and longitude form convenient reference points on a map.
You can remember latitude and longitude by doing jumping jacks.
When your hands are above your head and your feet are together, say longitude (your body is long!).
When you put your arms out to the side horizontally, say latitude (your head and arms make a cross, like the “t” in latitude).
While you are jumping, your arms are going the same way as each of these grid lines: horizontal for latitude and vertical for longitude.
Using Latitude and Longitude on a Map
If you know the latitude and longitude of a place, you can find it on a map.
Simply place one finger on the latitude on the vertical axis of the map.
Place your other finger on the longitude along the horizontal axis of the map.
Move your fingers along the latitude and longitude lines until they meet.
For example, say the location you want to find is at 30°N and 90°W.
Place your right finger along 30°N at the right of the map.
Place your left finger along the bottom at 90°W.
Move your fingers along the lines until they meet.
Your location should be near New Orleans, Louisiana, along the Gulf coast of the United States.
Now can you locate Old Faithful, 44°30'N and 110°150'W, on a map?
What if you want to know the latitude and longitude of your location?
If you know where you are on a map, point to the place with your fingers.
