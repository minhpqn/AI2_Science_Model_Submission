Cell Cycle - Advanced
Define the cell cycle.
Describe the key steps in the cell cycle.
What is a cell's life like?
The eukaryotic cell spends most of its "life" in interphase of the cell cycle, which can be subdivided into the three phases, G1, S and G2.
During interphase, the cell does what it is supposed to do.
Though cells have many common functions, such as DNA replication, they also have certain specific functions.
That is, during the life of a heart cell, the cell would obviously perform certain different activities than a kidney cell or a liver cell.
The remainder of the cell cycle is devoted to cell division: dividing the nucleus and cytoplasm.
During interphase, the DNA is unwound as chromatin, so that it can be exposed to the cellular machinery.
The Cell Cycle
Cell division in eukaryotic cells is much more complex than in prokaryotic cells because of the many chromosomes within the nucleus.
Both the cytoplasm and the genetic material must be divided, ensuring that each resulting daughter cell receives 46 separate chromosomes (in human cell).
