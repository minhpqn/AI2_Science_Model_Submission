The lanthanides are the 14 elements from cerium (atomic number 58) to lutetium (atomic number 71).
The word comes from the Greek “lanthanein” meaning “to be hidden.” The name probably arose because these elements all hide behind one another in the periodic table.
The 4 f sublevel is in the process of being filled for the lanthanides.
They are all metals and are similar in reactivity to the Group 2 alkaline earth metals.
The actinides are the 14 elements from thorium (atomic number 90) to lawrencium (atomic number 103).
The 5 f sublevel is in the process of being filled.
The actinides are all radioactive elements and only the first four have been found naturally on Earth.
All of the others have only been artificially made in the laboratory.
The lanthanides and actinides together are sometimes called the inner transition elements.
Uses of Lanthanides
Lanthanides have been widely used as alloys to impart strength and hardness to metals.  The main lanthanide used for this purpose is cerium, mixed with small amounts of lanthanum, neodymium, and praseodymium.  These metals are also widely used in the petroleum industry for refining of crude oil into gasoline products.
Lanthanides are used in oil refineries
Erbium and other lanthanides are widely used in some optical devices, such as night vision goggles, laser beams, and phosphorescent materials.

Uses of Actinides
The actinides are valuable primarily because they are radioactive.
These elements can be used as energy sources for applications as varied as cardiac pacemakers and generation of electrical energy for instruments on the moon.
Uranium and plutonium have been employed in nuclear weapons and in nuclear power plants.
