When these mosquitoes reproduce the next year, they produce more mosquitoes with the pesticide-resistant trait.
Soon, most of the mosquitoes in your state are resistant to the pesticide.
This is an example of microevolution because the number of mosquitoes with this trait changed.
However, this evolutionary change did not create a new species of mosquito because the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes can still reproduce with other non-pesticide-resistant mosquitoes.
Macroevolution refers to much bigger evolutionary changes that result in new species.
Macroevolution may happen:
When microevolution occurs repeatedly over a long period of time and leads to the creation of a new species.
As a result of a major environmental change, such as a volcanic eruption, earthquake, or an asteroid hitting Earth, which changes the environment so much that natural selection leads to large changes in the traits of a species.
After thousands of years of isolation from each other, Darwin's finch populations have experienced both microevolution and macroevolution.
These finch populations cannot breed with other finch populations when they are brought together.
Since they do not breed together, they are classified as separate species.
Microevolution is the process by which organisms change in small ways over time.
Macroevolution refers to larger evolutionary changes that result in new species.
