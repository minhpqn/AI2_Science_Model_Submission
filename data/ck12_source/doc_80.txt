They belong to the class Amphibia.
There are three orders:
Urodela, containing salamanders and newts.
Anura, containing frogs and toads.
Apoda, containing caecilians.
Where do Amphibians Live?
Most amphibians live in fresh water, not salt water.
Their habitats can include areas close to springs, streams, rivers, lakes, swamps and ponds.
They can be found in moist areas in forests, meadows and marshes.
Amphibians can be found almost anywhere there is a source of fresh water.
Although there are no true saltwater amphibians, a few can live in brackish (slightly salty) water.
Some species do not need any water at all, and several species have also adapted to live in drier environments.
Most amphibians still need water to lay their eggs.
How do Amphibians Reproduce?
Amphibians reproduce sexually.
The life cycle of amphibians happens in the following stages:
Egg Stage:
Amphibian eggs are fertilized in a number of ways.
External fertilization , employed by most frogs and toads, involves a male gripping a female across her back, almost as if he is squeezing the eggs out of her.
The male releases sperm over the female's eggs as they are laid.
