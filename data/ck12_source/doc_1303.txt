The land west of the San Andreas Fault is moving northeastward, while the North American plate moves southwest.
Someday, millions of years from now, Los Angeles will be a suburb of San Francisco!
The San Andreas Fault is a strike-slip fault
The San Andreas Fault runs up through California.
This transform fault separates the Pacific plate on the west and the North American plate on the east.
People sometimes say that California will fall into the ocean someday.
This is not true!
Someday Los Angeles will be a suburb of San Francisco (or will it be the other way around?).
A fracture with no movement on either side is a joint.
Dip-slip faults show vertical movement.
In a normal fault, the hanging wall drops down relative to the footwall.
The reverse is true of a reverse fault.
Strike-slip faults have horizontal motions due to shear stress.
