Explain how an internal combustion engine works.
Describe how kinetic energy from a car engine is used to turn the wheels of the car.
Describe mechanical waves.
Define the medium of a mechanical wave.
Identify three types of mechanical waves.
No doubt youâ€™ve seen this happen.
Droplets of water fall into a body of water, and concentric circles spread out through the water around the droplets.
The concentric circles are waves moving through the water.
Waves in Matter
The waves in the picture above are examples of mechanical waves.
A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy through the matter.
A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed.
A source of energy is needed to disturb matter and start a mechanical wave.
Q:
Where does the energy come from in the water wave pictured above?
A:
The energy comes from the falling droplets of water, which have kinetic energy because of their motion.
The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter.
The matter through which the wave travels is called the medium ( plural , media).
The medium in the water wave pictured above is water, a liquid.
