What form of energy is usually used in active transport?
Give an example of active transport.
Explain what occurs during this process.
Distinguish between autotrophs and heterotrophs.
Explain the importance of photosynthesis.
What can a tiny plant do that you can't do?
This tiny plant can use the energy of the sun to make its own food.
You can't make food by just sitting in the sun.
Plants are not the only organisms that can get energy from the sun, however.
Some protists, such as algae, and some bacteria can also use the energy of the sun to make their own food.
What is Photosynthesis?
If a plant gets hungry, it cannot walk to a local restaurant and buy a slice of pizza.
So, how does a plant get the food it needs to survive?
Plants are producers , which means they are able to make, or produce, their own food.
They also produce the "food" for other organisms.
Plants are also autotrophs.
Autotrophs are the organisms that collect the energy from the sun and turn it into organic compounds.
Using the energy from the sun, they produce complex organic compounds from simple inorganic molecules.
So once again, how does a plant get the food it needs to survive?
Through photosynthesis.
