For example, Styrofoam® coolers and thermos containers are used for these purposes.
With the interactive activity at the following URL, you can test different materials to see how well they prevent the transfer of thermal energy.
Materials that are good conductors of thermal energy are called thermal conductors.
Metals are very good thermal conductors.
Materials that are poor conductors of thermal energy are called thermal insulators.
Gases such as air and materials such as plastic and wood are thermal insulators.
Complete the worksheet at the following URL.
What is a thermal conductor?
Give an example.
Why do metals often feel cool to the touch?
Define thermal insulator.
Describe one way thermal insulators are used.
State the function of a home heating system.
Explain how hot-water and warm-air heating systems work.
A roaring blaze in a fireplace is a good way to keep toes toasty on a cold winter day.
But you probably wouldn’t use a fireplace to heat an entire house.
Do you know how your home is heated?
