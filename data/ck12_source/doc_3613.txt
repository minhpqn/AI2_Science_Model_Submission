Then, a new plasma membrane and cell wall form along each side of the cell plate.
Cytokinesis is the final stage of mitosis
Cytokinesis is the final stage of eukaryotic cell division.
It occurs differently in animal (left) and plant (right) cells.

The four phases of mitosis
The four phases of mitosis.
Can you describe what happens in each phase?
Cell division in eukaryotic cells includes mitosis, in which the nucleus divides, and cytokinesis, in which the cytoplasm divides and daughter cells form.
Mitosis occurs in four phases, called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
