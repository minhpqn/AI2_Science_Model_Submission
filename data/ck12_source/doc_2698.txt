What is the product of the synthesis reaction in which sodium combines with oxygen?
Write a balanced chemical equation for the synthesis reaction in which nitrogen reacts with hydrogen.
Complete the following two synthesis reactions by filling in the missing products:
2Al + 3Br 2 → ?
2K + S → ?
What is a synthesis reaction?
Describe the synthesis reaction that produces table salt.
Which of the following is a synthesis reaction?
2H 2 O → 2H 2 + O 2
2NO + O 2 → 2NO 2
2K + 2H 2 O → 2KOH + H 2
CH 4 + 2O 2 → CO 2 + 2H 2 O
Write the general chemical equation for a decomposition reaction.
Describe examples of decomposition reactions.
Hydrogen peroxide is a widely used disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes.
You may have a bottle of hydrogen peroxide like the one pictured here in your medicine cabinet at home.
Did you ever notice that hydrogen peroxide is always kept in a dark brown bottle like this one?
Do you know why?
The reason is that hydrogen peroxide needs to be protected from light.
If it isn’t, it will gradually break down to water and oxygen.
