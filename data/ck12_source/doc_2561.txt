Why was Mendeleev’s periodic table a good model?

Look at substances A–C in the photos above.
They look very different from one another, but they have something important in common.
All three are elements, or pure substances.
Can you identify which elements they are?
For ideas, listen to the amazing elements song at the URL below.
The singer rapidly names all of the known elements while pictures of the elements flash by.
Even if the video doesn’t help you name the elements pictured above, it will certainly impress you with the need to organize the large number of elements that have been discovered.

The First Periodic Table
In the 1860s, a scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev also saw the need to organize the elements.
He created a table in which he arranged all of the elements by increasing atomic mass from left to right across each row.
When he placed eight elements in each row and then started again in the next row, each column of the table contained elements with similar properties.
He called the columns of elements groups.
Mendeleev’s table is called a periodic table and the rows are called periods.
