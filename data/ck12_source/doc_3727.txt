Summarize the necessity of the genetic code.
Explain the role of stop codons.
Describe characteristics of the genetic code.
How do you go from four letters to 20 amino acids?
You need a code.
And the code that changes the information embedded in DNA and RNA into ordered amino acids and proteins is the genetic code.
And every living organism uses the same genetic code.
The Genetic Code
How is the information in a gene encoded?
The answer is the genetic code.
The genetic code consists of the sequence of nitrogen bases—A, C, G, U—in an mRNA chain.
The four bases make up the “letters” of the genetic code.
The letters are combined in groups of three to form code “words,” called codons .
Each codon stands for (encodes) one amino acid, unless it codes for a start or stop signal.
There are 20 common amino acids in proteins.
There are 64 possible codons, more than enough to code for the 20 amino acids.
The genetic code is shown in Figure below .
