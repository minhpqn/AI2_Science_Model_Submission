These blocks of crust are separated by normal faults.
This is known as block faulting .
The blocks slide up or down.
The result is alternating mountain ranges and valleys.
This topography is known as basin-and-range ( Figure below ).
The area near Death Valley, California is the center of a classic basin-and-range province ( Figure below ).
How a basin-and-range forms
This diagram shows how a basin-and-range forms.
Picture of a basin and range
This photograph was taken from a basin with a range in the distance near Death Valley, California.
Here you can find a very quick animation of movement of blocks in a basin-and-range setting:
Converging or diverging plates cause mountains to grow.
Subduction of oceanic crust beneath a continental or oceanic plate creates a chain of volcanoes.
Tensional forces bring about block faulting.
This creates a basin-and-range valleys and mountains.
