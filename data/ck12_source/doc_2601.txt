Physical Properties of Halogens
The halogen group is quite diverse.
It includes elements that occur in three different states of matter at room temperature.
Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine and astatine are solids.
Halogens also vary in color, as you can see in the Figure below .
Fluorine and chlorine are green, bromine is red, and iodine and astatine are nearly black.
Like other nonmetals, halogens cannot conduct electricity or heat.
Compared with most other elements, halogens have relatively low melting and boiling points.
You can watch a lab demonstration of the melting and boiling points of halogens at this URL:  .
