As shown in Table below , an organism with two alleles of the same type ( BB or bb ) is called a homozygote .
An organism with two different alleles ( Bb ) is called a heterozygote .
This results in three possible genotypes.
The expression of an organism’s genotype produces its phenotype .
The phenotype refers to the organism’s characteristics, such as purple or white flowers.
As you can see from Table above , different genotypes may produce the same phenotype.
For example, BB and Bb genotypes both produce plants with purple flowers.
Why does this happen?
In a Bb heterozygote, only the B allele is expressed, so the b allele doesn’t influence the phenotype.
In general, when only one of two alleles is expressed in the phenotype, the expressed allele is called the dominant allele.
The allele that isn’t expressed is called the recessive allele.
How Mendel Worked Backward to Get Ahead
Mendel used hundreds or even thousands of pea plants in each experiment he did.
Therefore, his results were very close to those you would expect based on the rules of probability (see "Probability and Inheritance" concept).
For example, in one of his first experiments with flower color, there were 929 plants in the F2 generation.
Of these, 705 (76 percent) had purple flowers and 224 (24 percent) had white flowers.
Thus, Mendel’s results were very close to the 75 percent purple and 25 percent white you would expect by the laws of probability for this type of cross.
Of course, Mendel had only phenotypes to work with.
He knew nothing about genes and genotypes.
Instead, he had to work backward from phenotypes and their percents in offspring to understand inheritance.
