With no internal heat, they are not geologically active.
An asteroid can only change due to a collision.
A collision may cause the asteroid to break up.
It may create craters on the asteroid’s surface.
An asteroid may strike a planet if it comes near enough to be pulled in by its gravity.

The asteroid’s mean radius is 15.7 km.
The Asteroid Belt
Hundreds of thousands of asteroids have been found in our solar system.
They are still being discovered at a rate of about 5,000 new asteroids per month!
The majority are located in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
This region is called the asteroid belt ( Figure below ).
There are many thousands of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Still, their total mass adds up to only about four percent of Earth’s Moon.
Asteroids formed at the same time as the rest of the solar system.
Although there are many in the asteroid belt, they were never able to form into a planet.
Jupiter's gravity kept them apart.
