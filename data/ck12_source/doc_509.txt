These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction.
An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury.
As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements.
Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured.
Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory.
Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.
Symptoms of severe brain injuries include
the loss of consciousness from several minutes to hours,
the inability to awaken from sleep,
loss of coordination,
persistent headache or headache that worsens.
Spinal Cord Injuries
A spinal cord injury is damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves at the end of the spinal canal.
This injury often causes permanent changes in strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of the injury.
Spinal cord injuries make it difficult for messages to travel between the brain and body.
They may cause a person to lose the ability to feel or move parts of the body.
This is called paralysis .
Whether paralysis occurs—and what parts of the body are affected if it does—depends on the location and seriousness of the injury.
In addition to car crashes and sports injuries, diving accidents are a common cause of spinal cord injuries.
Quadriplegia means your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury.
