To explain the difference between correlation and causation, let’s look at an example.
Sugar consumption in the United States has been rising for decades ( Figure below ).
There is a positive correlation between sugar consumption and rising average global temperatures.
American sugar consumption over time
American consumption of sugar, 1970-2009.
Is the rise in sugar consumption causing the rise in global temperatures?
Is the rise in global temperatures causing the rise in sugar consumption?
These two things aren't impossible, but they are extremely unlikely.
There’s no mechanism for one to increase the other.
Here there is correlation, not causation.
To establish causation we need to know how one would cause the other.
Fossil Fuel Burning Causes Temperatures to Rise
Here is a brief outline of the way an increase in CO 2 can increase global temperatures.
This is a logical step-by-step argument.
There is no part of this explanation that goes beyond the evidence.
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat.
CO 2 is a greenhouse gas.
Burning fossil fuels releases CO 2 into the atmosphere.
The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more heat can be trapped.
The more heat that’s trapped, the warmer average global temperatures are.
