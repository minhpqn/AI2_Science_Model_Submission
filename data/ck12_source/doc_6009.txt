Mass-Mole Stoichiometry
Tin metal reacts with hydrogen fluoride to produce tin(II) fluoride and hydrogen gas according to the following balanced equation.
\text{Sn}(s)+2\text{HF}(g) \rightarrow \text{SnF}_2(s)+\text{H}_2 (g)
How many moles of hydrogen fluoride are required to react completely with 75.0 g of tin?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given: 75.0 g Sn
molar mass of Sn = 118.69 g/mol
1 mol Sn = 2 mol HF (mole ratio)
Use the molar mass of Sn to convert the grams of Sn to moles.
Then use the mole ratio to convert from mol Sn to mol HF.
This will be done in a single two-step calculation.
g Sn → mol Sn → mol HF
Step 2:
Solve.
75.0 \text{ g Sn} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol Sn}}{118.69 \text{ g Sn}} \times \frac{2 \text{ mol HF}}{1 \text{ mol Sn}}=1.26 \text{ mol HF}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The mass of tin is less than one mole, but the 1:2 ratio means that more than one mole of HF is required for the reaction.
The answer has three significant figures because the given mass has three significant figures.
