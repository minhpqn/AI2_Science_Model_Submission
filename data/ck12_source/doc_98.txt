Characteristics of Lizards and Snakes
Lizards and snakes are distinguished by scales or shields and movable quadrate bones, which make it possible to open the upper jaw very wide.
Quadrate bones are especially visible in snakes, because they are able to open their mouths very wide to eat large prey ( Figure below ).
Without this ability, the snake diet would be very limited.

Characteristics of Lizards
Key features of lizards include:
A short neck.
A long tail, which they can shed in order to escape from predators.
They eat insects.
Vision, including color vision, is well-developed in lizards.
You may have seen a lizard camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings.
Since they have great vision, lizards communicate by changing the color of their bodies.
They also communicate with chemical signals called pheromones .
Adult lizards range from one inch in length, like some Caribbean geckos, to the nearly 10-foot-long Komodo dragon ( Figure below ).

Komodo dragons will eat just about anything and they often attack deer, goats, pigs, dogs and, occasionally, humans.
With 40 lizard families, there is an extremely wide range of color, appearance, and size of lizards.
