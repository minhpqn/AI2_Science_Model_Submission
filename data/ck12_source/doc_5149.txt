Can you find examples of the different stages of mitosis?
Cytokinesis is the final step in cell division.
It often occurs concurrently with telophase, though it is a separate process.
Cytokinesis ( Figure below ) differs between plant and animal cells.
In animal cells, the plasma membrane pinches inward along the cellâ€™s equator until two cells are formed.
Specifically, a cleavage furrow containing a contractile ring develops in approximately the middle of the cell (similar to the position of the metaphase plate), essentially pinching off the two nuclei and forming separate cells.
In plant cells, a cell plate forms along the cells equator.
A new membrane grows along each side of the cell plate, with a new cell wall forming on the outside of each new membrane.
At the end of cytokinesis, each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell.
The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase, the end of one cell cycle, and the beginning of G 1 and interphase of the next cell cycle.
Cytokinesis is the final stage of eukaryotic cell division.
It occurs differently in animal (left) and plant (right) cells.
In this electron micrograph of a cell, the formation of two new cells is almost complete, as new membrane grows and divides the parent cell.

anaphase :
Phase of mitosis during which sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.
cell plate :
Forms during cytokinesis in plant cells; a new membrane grows along each side of the cell plate, with a new cell wall forming on the outside of each new membrane.
