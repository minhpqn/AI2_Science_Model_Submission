Define cartilage and ligament.
Explain bone growth.
Are bones alive?
From seeing a skeleton, you might think that bones are just dead, hollow structures.
But in a living person, those hollow spaces are full of living cells.
Bones have a blood supply and nerves.
Bones are a living tissue.
How important is your skeleton?
Can you imagine your body without it?
You would be a wobbly pile of muscle and internal organs, and you would not be able to move.
The adult human skeleton has 206 bones, some of which are named below ( Figure below ).
Bones are made up of living tissue.
They contain many different types of tissues.
Cartilage, a dense connective tissue, is found at the end of bones and is made of tough protein fibers.
Cartilage creates smooth surfaces for the movement of bones that are next to each other, like the bones of the knee.
Ligaments are made of tough protein fibers and connect bones to each other.
Your bones, cartilage, and ligaments make up your skeletal system .
Illustration of the human skeletal system
The skeletal system is made up of bones, cartilage, and ligaments.
The skeletal system has many important functions in your body.
