That’s because the table keeps repeating from row to row, and periodic means “repeating.”
The Modern Periodic Table
A periodic table is still used today to organize the elements.
You can see a simple version of the modern periodic table in the Figure below .
The modern table is based on Mendeleev’s table, except the modern table arranges the elements by increasing atomic number instead of atomic mass.
Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom, and this number is unique for each element.
The modern table has more elements than Mendeleev’s table because many elements have been discovered since Mendeleev’s time.

Reading the Table
In the Figure above , each element is represented by its chemical symbol, which consists of one or two letters.
The first letter of the symbol is always written in upper case, and the second letter—if there is one—is always written in lower case.
For example, the symbol for copper is Cu.
It stands for cuprum , which is the Latin word for copper.
The number above each symbol in the table is its unique atomic number.
Notice how the atomic numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom in the table.
