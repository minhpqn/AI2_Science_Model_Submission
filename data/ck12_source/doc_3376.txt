An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current.
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating current with a magnetic field.
It occurs when a magnetic field and electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another.
A transformer may either increase or decrease voltage.
You can see the basic components of an electric transformer in the Figure below .

Schematic of a generic transformer
The transformer in the diagram consists of two wire coils wrapped around an iron core.
Each coil is part of a different circuit.
When alternating current passes through coil P, it magnetizes the iron core.
Because the current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps reversing.
This is where electromagnetic induction comes in.
The changing magnetic field induces alternating current in coil S of the other circuit.
Stepping Up or Stepping Down
Notice that coil P and coil S in the Figure above have the same number of turns of wire.
In this case, the voltages of the primary and secondary currents are the same.
Usually, the two coils of a transformer have different numbers of turns.
In that case, the voltages of the two currents are different.
When coil S has more turns than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is greater than the voltage in the primary current (see Figure below ).
