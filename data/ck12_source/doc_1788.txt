Surface Processes and Landforms
Why don't these mountains look the same?
The same plate tectonics processes caused both sets of mountains to rise.
In both cases, two continental plates smashed together at a convergent plate boundary.
The Himalaya Mountains on the left are still uplifting.
The landscape is steep and rugged.
The photo on the right shows the Appalachian Mountains.
These mountains were once steep like the Himalaya.
If the only processes on Earth were plate tectonics processes, the Appalachians might still look like the Himalaya.
But the Appalachian Mountains are low and rounded.
Over time the Appalachians have undergone weathering and erosion.
This chapter is about the processes that modify the landscape.
These processes alter landforms.
Some of these processes create new landforms.
Weathering and Erosion
Weathering breaks rocks apart or alters them.
Erosion moves the pieces of broken rock.
Why are these rocks different?
The rock seen on the left is being mined in a quarry.
What are the features of the rock?
