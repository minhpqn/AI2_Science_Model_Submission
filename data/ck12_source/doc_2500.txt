The zero stands for “zero charge.” The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than the mass of a proton, which is 1 atomic mass unit (amu). (An atomic mass unit equals about 1.67 × 10 -27 kilograms.) A neutron also has about the same diameter as a proton, or 1.7 × 10 -17 meters.
Same Element, Different Numbers of Neutrons
All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons.
The number of neutrons, however, may vary for atoms of the same element.
For example, almost 99 percent of carbon atoms have six neutrons, but the rest have either seven or eight neutrons.
Atoms of an element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
The nuclei of these isotopes of carbon are shown in the Figure below .
The isotope called carbon-14 is used to find the ages of fossils.

Q:
Notice the names of the carbon isotopes in the diagram.
Based on this example, infer how isotopes of an element are named.
A:
Isotopes of an element are named for their total number of protons and neutrons.
Q:
The element oxygen has 8 protons.
How many protons and neutrons are there in oxygen-17?
A:
Oxygen-17—like all atoms of oxygen—has 8 protons.
