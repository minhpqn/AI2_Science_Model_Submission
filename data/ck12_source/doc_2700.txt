Another decomposition reaction occurs when water (H 2 O) breaks down to produce hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) gases (see Figure below ).
This happens when an electric current passes through the water, as illustrated below.
The equation for this reaction is:
2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + O 2

Decomposition of water.
Q:
What ratio of hydrogen molecules (H 2 ) to oxygen molecules (O 2 ) is produced in the decomposition of water?
A:
Two hydrogen molecules per oxygen molecule are produced because water (H 2 O) has a ratio of two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.
A decomposition reaction occurs when one reactant breaks down into two or more products.
This can be represented by the general equation:
AB → A + B.
Examples of decomposition reactions include the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, and the breakdown of water to hydrogen and oxygen.
