The physical appearance of an organism determined by a particular genotype (and sometimes also by the environment).
Mendelian inheritance patterns can be seen in humans.
Albinism is a genetic disorder that is inherited as a simple Mendelian trait.
Genotype determines phenotype.
A homozygous dominant or a heterozygous genotype will always show a dominant phenotype.
A homozygous recessive genotype can only show a recessive phenotype.
Modern Genetics at
Relate the term homozygous to heterozygous by using an example from Mendel’s experiments.
Relate the term genotype to phenotype by using an example from Mendel’s experiments.
Why can’t you always identify the genotype of an organism from its phenotype?
Explain Mendel’s laws in genetic terms, that is, in terms of chromosomes, genes, and alleles.
If Darwin knew of Mendel’s work, how might it have influenced his theory of evolution?
Do you think this would have affected how well Darwin’s work was accepted?
Inheritance Probability - Advanced
Identify how probability is used to predict outcomes of genetic crosses.
Identify how probability can help determine the alleles in a gamete. .
What are the odds of landing on 7 again?
Not as high as inheriting an allele from a parent.
Probability plays a big role in determining the chance of inheriting an allele from a parent.
It is similar to tossing a coin.
