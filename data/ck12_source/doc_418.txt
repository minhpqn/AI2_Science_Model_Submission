Antibodies attack strange substances in the body.
This is a normal part of your immune response, which is your defense against disease.
For example, imagine a person with type O blood was given type A blood.
First, what type of antibodies do people with type O blood produce?
They produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies.
This means, if a person with type O blood received type A blood, the anti-A antibodies in the personâ€™s blood would attack the A antigens on the RBCs in the donor blood ( Figure below ).
The antibodies would cause the RBCs to clump together, and the clumps could block a blood vessel.
This clumping of blood cells could cause death.
This diagram illustrates the relationship between blood type and antibodies in blood
A person with type O blood has A and B antibodies in his/her plasma; if the person was to get type A blood instead of type O, his/her A antibodies would attach to the antigens on the RBCs and cause them to clump together.
People with type A blood produce anti-B antibodies, and people with type B blood produce anti-A antibodies.
People with type AB blood do not produce either antibody.
The Rhesus Factor
The second most important blood group system in human blood is the Rhesus (Rh) factor .
A person either has, or does not have, the Rh antigen on the surface of their RBCs.
If they do have it, then the person is positive.
If the person does not have the antigen, they are considered negative.
Recall that people with type O blood do not have any antigens on their RBCs.
As a result, type O blood can be given to people with blood types A, B, or AB.
If there are no antigens on the RBCs, there cannot be an antibody reaction in the blood.
