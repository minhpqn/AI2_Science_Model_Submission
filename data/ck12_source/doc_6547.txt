Kekulé was the first to propose the cyclic structure of benzene
Can a dream affect reality?
Friedrich Kekulé was a German chemist in the 1800s.
He supposedly was thinking about the structure of the benzene ring as he fell asleep.
While asleep, he dreamed of a snake eating the ring's tail.
He used this idea to propose the cyclic structure for benzene.
Whether or not he actually had this dream has been debated ever since.
Whatever really happened, the tale has persisted until today.
Benzene is the parent compound of the large family of organic compounds known as aromatic compounds.
