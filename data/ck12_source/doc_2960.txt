A:
The object has traveled a distance of 50 meters.
Slope Equals Velocity
In a position-time graph, the velocity of the moving object is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line.
If the graph line is horizontal, like the line after time = 5 seconds in Graph 2 in the Figure below , then the slope is zero and so is the velocity.
The position of the object is not changing.
The steeper the line is, the greater the slope of the line is and the faster the object’s motion is changing.
The slope of a position time graph is velocity
Calculating Average Velocity from a Position-Time Graph
It’s easy to calculate the average velocity of a moving object from a position-time graph.
Average velocity equals the change in position (represented by Δd) divided by the corresponding change in time (represented by Δt):
\text{velocity}= \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}\\\
For example, in Graph 2 in the Figure above , the average velocity between 0 seconds and 5 seconds is:
\text{velocity} & = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}\\\& =\frac{25 \ \text{m}-0 \ \text{m}}{5 \ \text{s}-0 \ \text{s}}\\\& =\frac{25 \ \text{m}}{5 \ \text{s}}\\\& =5 \ \text{m/s}
At the following URL, review the shape of a position-time graph and its relationship to velocity.
Then use the widget at the bottom of the Web page to generate position-time graphs for an object with specified characteristics.
Motion can be represented by a position-time graph, which plots position relative to the starting point on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.
The slope of a position-time graph represents velocity.
The steeper the slope is, the faster the motion is changing.
Average velocity can be calculated from a position-time graph as the change in position divided by the corresponding change in time.
