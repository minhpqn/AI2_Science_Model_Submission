A:
Natural gas produces much less pollution and carbon dioxide when it burns than gasoline does.
So a natural gas vehicle would contribute less to global climate change, acid rain, and air pollution that harms health.
Besides being better for the environment, burning natural gas instead of gasoline results in less engine wear and provides more energy for a given amount of fuel.
Like fossil fuels, the radioactive element uranium can be used to generate electrical energy in power plants.
This source of energy is known as nuclear energy .
In a nuclear power plant, the nuclei of uranium atoms are split apart into smaller nuclei in the process of nuclear fission.
This process releases a tremendous amount of energy from just a small amount of uranium.
The total supply of uranium in the world is quite limited, however, and cannot be replaced once it is used up.
That’s why nuclear energy is a nonrenewable resource.
The use of nuclear energy also produces dangerous radioactive wastes.
In addition, accidents at nuclear power plants have the potential to release large amounts of harmful radiation into the environment.
Q:
Why is nuclear energy often considered to be “greener” than energy from fossil fuels?
A:
Unlike energy from fossil fuels, nuclear energy doesn’t produce air pollution or carbon dioxide that contributes to global climate change.
Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up.
Nonrenewable energy resources include fossil fuels and uranium.
Fossil fuels—including oil, natural gas, and coal—provide most of the energy used in the world today.
Burning fossil fuels produces air pollution as well as carbon dioxide that causes global climate change.
