Why is heredity so important?
Genetics - the study of inheritance.
Inheritance - the passing of traits from parents to offspring.
How are these traits "passed"?
Through DNA - the genetic material.
The Genetics chapter will focus on genetics, inheritance, and DNA.
Mendel's Pea Plants
Describe the importance of Gregor Mendel.
Explain why Mendel studied pea plants.
Distinguish self-pollination from cross-pollination.
What's so interesting about pea plants?
These purple-flowered plants are not just pretty to look at.
Plants like these led to a huge leap forward in biology.
The plants are common garden pea plants, and they were studied in the mid-1800s by an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel.
With his careful experiments, Mendel uncovered the secrets of heredity, or how parents pass characteristics to their offspring.
You may not care much about heredity in pea plants, but you probably care about your own heredity.
Mendel’s discoveries apply to you as well as to peas—and to all other living things that reproduce sexually.
Mendel and His Pea Plants
People have long known that the characteristics of living things are similar in parents and their offspring.
Whether it’s the flower color in pea plants or nose shape in people, it is obvious that offspring resemble their parents.
