What would be the voltage for the reaction where Zn metal forms Zn 2+ ?
electrolysis:
The process in which electrical energy is used to cause a nonspontaneous chemical reaction to occur.
electrolytic cell:
The apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction.
Electrolysis of Water
Describe the experimental set-up for the electrolysis of water.
Write equations for the reactions involved in the process.
Photoelectrolysis is being explored as a method of generating power
More energy from the sun?
With fossil fuels becoming more expensive and less available, scientists are looking for other energy sources.
Hydrogen has long been considered an ideal source, since it does not pollute when it burns.
The problem has been finding ways to generate hydrogen economically.
One new approach that is being studied is photoelectrolysis â€“ the generation of electricity using photovoltaic cells to split water molecules.
This technique is still in the research stage, but appears to be a very promising source of power in the future.
Electrolysis of Water
The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen gases.
The electrolytic cell consists of a pair of platinum electrodes immersed in water to which a small amount of an electrolyte such as H 2 SO 4 has been added.
The electrolyte is necessary because pure water will not carry enough charge due to the lack of ions.
At the anode, water is oxidized to oxygen gas and hydrogen ions.
