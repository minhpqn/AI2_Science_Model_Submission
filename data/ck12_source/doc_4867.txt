DNA contains the genetic information needed for building structures such as proteins and RNA molecules in the cell.
An introduction to the cell, discussing various parts of the cell, is available at

cell membrane :
Thin coat of lipids (phospholipids) that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment; also called the plasma membrane.
cytoplasm :
The gel-like material inside the plasma membrane of a cell; holds the cell's organelles (excluding the nucleus).
cytosol :
A watery cytoplasmic fluid that contains cytoskeletal fragments, dissolved particles and organelles.
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) :
Double-stranded nucleic acid that composes genes and chromosomes; the hereditary material.
eukaryotic :
From an organism that has cells containing a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles; eukaryote.
messenger RNA (mRNA) :
Type of RNA that copies genetic instructions from DNA in the nucleus and carries them to the cytoplasm.
organelle :
A structure within the cytoplasm of a cell; may be enclosed within a membrane; performs a specific function.
plasma membrane :
Thin coat of lipids (phospholipids) that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment; also called the cell membrane.
