The muscular walls of the uterus push the baby out during birth.
The two ovaries are small, oval organs on either side of the uterus.
Each ovary contains thousands of eggs, with about 1-2 million immature eggs present at birth and 40,000 immature eggs present at puberty, as most of the eggs die off.
The eggs do not fully develop until a female has gone through puberty.
About once a month, on average one egg completes development and is released by the ovary.
The ovaries also secrete estrogen , the main female sex hormone.
The two fallopian tubes are narrow tubes that open off from the uterus.
Each tube reaches for one of the ovaries, but the tubes are not attached to the ovaries.
The end of each fallopian tube by the ovary has “fingers” ( Figure above ).
They sweep an egg into the fallopian tube.
Then the egg passes through the fallopian tube to the uterus.
If an egg is to be fertilized, this will occur in the fallopian tube.
A fertilized egg then implants into the wall of the uterus, where it begins to develop.
An unfertilized egg will flow through the uterus and be excreted from the body.
Female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
The ovaries release the eggs and secrete estrogen.
