Therefore, A \cap B is the intersection of events A and B and can be used to find the probability of both events occurring.
If, in a Venn diagram, either A or B occurs, the symbol is \cup.
This symbol would represent the union of events A and B, where the outcome would be in either A or B.
Example 3 You are asked to roll a die.
Event A is the event of rolling a 1, 2, or a 3.
Event B is the event of rolling a 3, 4, or a 5.
Draw a Venn diagram to represent this example.
What is A \cap B?
What is A \cup B?
Solution:
We know that:
S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\!\\A = \{1, 2, 3\}\!\\B = \{3, 4, 5\} A \cap B = \{3\}\!\\A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} Independent Events In mathematics, the term independent means to have one event not dependent on the other.
It is similar to the English definition.
Suppose you are trying to convince your parent/guardian to let you go to the movies on your own.
Your parent/guardian is thinking that if you go, you will not have time to finish your homework.
For this reason, you have to convince him/her that you are independent enough to go to the movies and finish your homework.
Therefore, you are trying to convince your parent/guardian that the 2 events, going to the movies and finishing your homework, are independent.
This is similar to the mathematical definition.
Say you were asked to pick a particular card from a deck of cards and roll a 6 on a die.
It does not matter if you choose the card first and roll a 6 second, or vice versa.
