Why is it the key to how a cooling system works?
External Combustion Engines
Identify the purpose of a combustion engine.
Define external combustion engine.
Outline how an external combustion engine works.
This picture was taken in 1899 (the color was added later).
The picture shows the inventor of an early automobile, along with his wife, driving one of his inventions.
The man and woman were on their way to the top of Mount Washington, the highest mountain in the eastern U.S.
The purpose of the trip up the mountain was to get publicity for the steam-powered automobile.
The inventor and his wife were the first people to ever reach the top of the mountain by car.
Steam engines are not used very much anymore, because more efficient and powerful engines have been developed.
But inventors and engineers learned a lot from these early combustion engines.
Q:
How else were steam engines used?
A:
Starting in the 1700s and up until the early 1900s, steam engines were commonly used to run factory machines, train locomotives, and ships.
Their power led to a revolution in industry and transportation.
What Is a Combustion Engine?
A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the thermal energy to do work.
There are two types of combustion engines: external and internal.
