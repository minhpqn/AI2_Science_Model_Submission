Sometimes pedigrees can also help determine whether individuals with the trait are heterozygous (two different alleles) or homozygous (two of the same allele).
Some points to keep in mind when analyzing a pedigree are:
With autosomal recessive inheritance, all affected individuals will be homozygous recessive.
With dominant inheritance, all affected individuals will have at least one dominant allele.
They will be either homozygous dominant or heterozygous.
With sex-linked inheritance, more males (XY) than females (XX) usually have the trait.
Sex-linked inheritance is usually recessive.
Symbols of a pedigree, and an example pedigree
In a pedigree, squares symbolize males, and circles represent females.
A horizontal line joining a male and female indicates that the couple had offspring.
Vertical lines indicate offspring which are listed left to right, in order of birth.
Shading of the circle or square indicates an individual who has the trait being traced.
In this pedigree, the inheritance of the recessive trait is being traced.
A is the dominant allele, and a is the recessive allele.
A pedigree is a chart which shows the inheritance of a trait over several generations.
From studying a pedigree, scientists can determine if a trait is sex-linked or autosomal.
