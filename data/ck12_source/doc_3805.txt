From Lyell, Darwin saw that Earth and its life were very old.
Thus, there had been enough time for evolution to produce the great diversity of life Darwin had observed.
From Malthus, Darwin knew that populations could grow faster than their resources.
This “overproduction of offspring” led to a “struggle for existence,” in Darwin’s words.
From artificial selection, Darwin knew that some offspring have variations that occur by chance, and that can be inherited.
In nature, offspring with certain variations might be more likely to survive the “struggle for existence” and reproduce.
If so, they would pass their favorable variations to their offspring.
Darwin coined the term fitness to refer to an organism’s relative ability to survive and produce fertile offspring.
Nature selects the variations that are most useful.
Therefore, he called this type of selection natural selection .
Darwin knew artificial selection could change domestic species over time.
He inferred that natural selection could also change species over time.
In fact, he thought that if a species changed enough, it might evolve into a new species.
Wallace’s paper not only confirmed Darwin’s ideas.
It also pushed him to finish his book, On the Origin of Species .
Published in 1859, this book changed science forever.
It clearly spelled out Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and provided convincing arguments and evidence to support it.
Applying Darwin’s Theory
The following example applies Darwin’s theory.
It explains how giraffes came to have such long necks (see Figure below ).
