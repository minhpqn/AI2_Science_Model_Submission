high temperature and high humidity throughout the year.
a moist-cool, transcontinental coniferous forest.
an absence of trees, the presence of dwarf plants, and a ground surface that is wet, spongy, and hummocky.
distinct wet and dry seasons with hot temperatures all year long.
Identify two types of tundra and where they are found.
What terrestrial biome has the highest biodiversity? the lowest?
In which biome are you most likely to find grasses, zebras, and lions?
If you were to design a well-adapted desert animal, what adaptations would you give it to help it survive in its desert biome?
Give an overview of aquatic biomes.
Explain the factors that are used to define aquatic biomes.
Distinguish the photic zone from the aphasic zone.
Summarize adaptations necessary to live in a marine biome.
Define intertidal zone.
Do aquatic ecosystems need sunlight?
Of course.
The sunlight - in part - allows the diversity of life seen in this ecosystem.
If the available sunlight was less, could this ecosystem still thrive?
Maybe, but the ecosystem would probably be very different.
Sunlight, of course, is necessary for photosynthesis, which brings energy into an ecosystem.
So, the availability of that sunlight has a direct impact on the productivity and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems.
