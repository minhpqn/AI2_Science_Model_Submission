List and describe the function of the main types of lipids.
Oil.
Does it mix with water?
No.
Biologically, why is this important?
Oil is a lipid.
The property of chemically not being able to mix with water gives lipids some very important biological functions.
Lipids form the outer membrane of cells.
Why?
A lipid is an organic compound such as fat or oil.
Organisms use lipids to store energy, but lipids have other important roles as well.
Lipids consist of repeating units called fatty acids.
Fatty acids are organic compounds that have the general formula CH 3 (CH 2 ) n COOH, where n usually ranges from 2 to 28 and is always an even number.
There are two types of fatty acids: saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids.
Saturated Fatty Acids
In saturated fatty acids , carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
This causes the molecules to form straight chains, as shown in Figure below .
The straight chains can be packed together very tightly, allowing them to store energy in a compact form.
This explains why saturated fatty acids are solids at room temperature.
Animals use saturated fatty acids to store energy.
