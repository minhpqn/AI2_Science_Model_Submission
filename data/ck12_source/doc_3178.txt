A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium.
The medium is the matter through which the wave travels.
Ocean waves are the best-known examples of surface waves.
They travel on the surface of the water between the ocean and the air.
Q:
What do you think causes ocean waves?
A:
Most ocean waves are caused by wind blowing across the water.
Moving air molecules transfer some of their energy to molecules of ocean water.
The energy travels across the surface of the water in waves.
The stronger the winds are blowing, the larger the waves are and the more energy they have.
How the Medium Moves
A surface wave is a combination of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave.
A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave.
A longitudinal wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave.
In a surface wave, particles of the medium move up and down as well as back and forth.
This gives them an overall circular motion.
