Although a study may take place in a single laboratory, a scientist must present her work to the community of scientists in her field.
Scientists sharing their results at a scientific conference
Participants share their results at a scientific conference.
The scientist may present her data and conclusions at a scientific conference ( Figure above ).
She will talk with many other scientists to see what they think of her work.
Scientists will openly discuss and criticize the work.
The scientist may need to gather more data to resolve the problems.
Later, she will write a paper to be published in a scientific journal.
Several scientists will review the paper.
This process is called peer review .
They will make sure the researcher used scientific method.
They will make sure her interpretations follow logically from the data.
The scientists may then recommend that she does further work.
Or they may deny the paper for publication.
Once the paper is published, other scientists will use her results in their own work.
Scientific ideas are advanced after many papers on a topic are published.
The Outcomes of a Scientific Study
Sometimes a study will support an idea.
This may bring the idea closer to acceptance in the scientific community.
Sometimes new methods or procedures may be developed for a study to be performed.
