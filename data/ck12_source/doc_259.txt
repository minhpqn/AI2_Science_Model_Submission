The radius of the planet Mercury is 2.43 × 10 6 m and its mass is 3.2 × 10 23  kg.
Find the speed of a satellite in orbit 265,000 m above the surface.
Find the period of the satellite.
A geosynchronous orbit is an orbit in which the satellite remains over the same spot on the earth as the earth turns.
This is accomplished by matching the velocity of the satellite to the velocity of the turning earth.
The orbital radius of a geosynchronous satellite is 4.23 × 10 7 m (measured from the center of the earth).
What is the speed of the satellite in orbit?
What is its period?
