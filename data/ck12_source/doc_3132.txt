Combine harvester grinding plants to produce ethanol
This large machine is harvesting and grinding plants to make ethanol.
Geothermal energy is thermal (“heat”) energy from below Earth’s surface.
It can be used to heat homes or generate electricity.
A geothermal system pumps water underground where it is heated and then pumps the warm water back to the home or power plant (see Figure below ).
The thermal energy of the water can be used directly to heat the home.
Or it can be used to produce steam and generate electricity.
Installing a geothermal system can be expensive because of the need to drill through underground rocks, but the energy it uses is free.

Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply.
Renewable energy resources include wind, sunlight, moving water, biomass, and geothermal energy.
Except for biomass, which is burned, these renewable energy resources produce little if any pollution, although each has other drawbacks.
Use the resource to answer the questions that follow.
