Seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys.
This type of volcanism makes all of the ocean floor!
Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands ( Figure below ).

Eruptions are found at divergent plate boundaries as continents break apart, known as continental rifting .
The Mount Gahinga volcanoes ( Figure below ) are in the East African Rift between the African and Arabian plates.
Baja California is breaking apart from mainland Mexico, also by continental rifting.

Subduction at convergent plate boundaries leads to melting and volcanoes.
Convergent plate boundaries line the Pacific Ocean basin so that volcanic arcs line the region.
Melting at divergent plate boundaries is due to release of pressure.
At mid-ocean ridges seafloor is pulled apart and new seafloor is created.
Rifting in a continent can create a new ocean eventually.
