How do ecosystems gain most of the carbon?
How is carbon released from ecosystems?
What is the role of the carbon cycle?
Why is cycling carbon important?
Describe a major method that carbon is cycled.
How have human activities increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels?
Outline the steps of the nitrogen cycle.
Explain nitrogen fixation.
Discuss the roles of ammonification, nitrification and denitrification in the nitrogen cycle.
Alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupins, mesquite, carob, soy, and peanuts.
What are these?
Legumes.
Legume plants have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, due to a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with bacteria found in root nodules of these plants.
The Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen makes up 78 percent of Earth’s atmosphere.
It’s also an important part of living things.
Nitrogen is found in proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.
The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen through the abiotic and biotic parts of ecosystems.
Figure below shows how nitrogen cycles through a terrestrial ecosystem.
Nitrogen passes through a similar cycle in aquatic ecosystems.
