Is our current population level creating problems with available space?
Why or why not?
List three factors that affect population growth?
Compare altricial organisms to precocial organisms.
What is the overall equation for growth rate?
Does a typical population show exponential growth?
Why or why not?
Define carrying capacity.
Limiting Factors to Population Growth
Give examples of limiting factors to population growth.
Explain how limiting factors affect population growth.
What happened during the Irish Potato Famine?
In the 1800s, a disease called potato blight destroyed much of the potato crop in Ireland.
Since many Irish people depended on potatoes as their staple food, mass starvation and emigration resulted.
This caused Ireland's population to dramatically decrease.
Lack of food is one factor that can limit population growth.
Limiting Factors to Population Growth
For a population to be healthy, factors such as food, nutrients, water and space, must be available.
What happens when there are not resources to support the population?
Limiting factors are resources or other factors in the environment that can lower the population growth rate.
