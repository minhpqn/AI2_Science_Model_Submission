Process in cellular respiration or photosynthesis which produces ATP; uses the energy of hydrogen ions diffusing through ATP synthase.
cristae :
Inner membrane folds of the mitochondrion.
electron transport chain :
Series of electron-transport molecules that pass high-energy electrons from molecule to molecule and capture their energy.
Krebs cycle :
Stage 2 of aerobic cellular respiration; a series of chemical reactions which completes the breakdown of glucose begun in stage 1, releasing more chemical energy and producing carbon dioxide; also called the Citric Acid Cycle.
matrix :
Fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrion; space inside of the inner membrane.
mitochondria : (singular, mitochondrion ):
Membrane-enclosed organelles that are found in most eukaryotic cells; called the "power plants" of the cell because they use energy from organic compounds to make ATP.
Mitochondria are organelles whose membranes are specialized for aerobic respiration.
The matrix of the mitochondria is the site of Krebs Cycle reactions.
The electron transport chain and most ATP synthesis rely on the compartments created by the inner membrane of the mitochondria.
