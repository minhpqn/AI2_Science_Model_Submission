Use the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure above to find out which of the three types of light have the highest frequencies.
Light with the longest wavelengths is called infrared light .
The term infrared means “below red.” Infrared light is the range of light waves that have longer wavelengths and lower frequencies than red light in the visible range of light waves.
The sun gives off infrared light as do flames and living things.
You can’t see infrared light waves, but you can feel them as heat.
But infrared cameras and night vision goggles can detect infrared light waves and convert them to visible images.

The only light that people can see is called visible light .
This light consists of a very narrow range of wavelengths that falls between infrared light and ultraviolet light.
Within the visible range, we see light of different wavelengths as different colors of light, from red light, which has the longest wavelength, to violet light, which has the shortest wavelength (see Figure below ).
When all of the wavelengths of visible light are combined, as they are in sunlight, visible light appears white.

Visible light spectrum
Visible light spectrum.
Light with wavelengths shorter than visible light is called ultraviolet light .
The term ultraviolet means “above violet.” Ultraviolet light is the range of light waves that have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than violet light in the visible range of light.
With higher frequencies than visible light, ultraviolet light has more energy.
It can be used to kill bacteria in food and to sterilize surgical instruments.
