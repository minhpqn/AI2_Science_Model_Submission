How many dolls are in this picture?
Russian “nesting dolls” (often known as matryoshka dolls) have a long history in Russia.
These dolls are designed to nest inside of one another.
When we open the largest doll, we find a somewhat smaller doll inside it.
These dolls can often go down seven or eight layers.
The set seen above is unusual in that it has over thirty-five layers.
Lanthandies and Actinides
We see some hidden “layers” in chemistry.
As we look at the periodic table below, we see two pink boxes – one between Ba (element 56) and Hf (element 72) and the other between Ra (88) and Rf (104).
These elements all have unfilled f -sublevels.  Because of the uniqueness of the electron configurations, these elements fit into the two boxes in the larger periodic table.
As the number of elecrons in an atom increases, we begin to see some strange behaviors.
Due to the way the electron energy levels work, some inner levels fill after one or more outer levels do.
We see this in two similar groups of elements – the lanthanides and the actinides
Lanthanides and actinides on the periodic table
The first of the f sublevels to begin filling is the 4 f sublevel.
It fills after the 6 s sublevel, meaning that f sublevels are two principal energy levels behind.
The general electron configuration for elements in the f block is ( n -  2 )f 1-14 ns 2 .
The seven orbitals of the f sublevel accommodate 14 electrons, so the f block is 14 elements in length.
It is pulled out of the main body of the period table and is shown at the very bottom.
Because of that, the elements of the f block do not belong to a group, being wedged in between Groups 3 and 4.
