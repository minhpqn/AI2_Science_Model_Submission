The third is half the size of the second.
But when the cylinders get small, the differences are much harder to see.
At some point, there is too little of the parent left.
That isotope pair is no longer useful for dating.
Radioactive decay is the breakdown of unstable elements into stable elements.
To understand this process, recall that the atoms of all elements contain the particles protons, neutrons, and electrons.
An element is defined by the number of protons it contains.
All atoms of a given element contain the same number of protons.
The number of neutrons in an element may vary.
Atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes .
Consider carbon as an example.
Two isotopes of carbon are shown below ( Figure below ).
Compare their protons and neutrons.
Both contain six protons.
But carbon-12 has six neutrons and carbon-14 has eight neutrons.

Isotopes are named for their number of protons plus neutrons.
If a carbon atom had seven neutrons, what would it be named?
Almost all carbon atoms are carbon-12.
This is a stable isotope of carbon.
