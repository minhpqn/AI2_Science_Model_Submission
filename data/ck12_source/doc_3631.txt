Sexually reproducing organisms can have different types of life cycles.
Three are represented in Figure below and described following sections.
Haploid, diploid, and alternating life cycles
Life cycles can vary in sexually reproducing organisms.
Three types of sexual life cycles are shown here.
Do you see how they differ?
The letter n indicates haploid stages of the life cycles, and 2n indicates diploid stages.
Haploid Life Cycle
The haploid life cycle is the simplest life cycle.
It is found in many single-celled eukaryotic organisms.
Organisms with a haploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as haploid gametes.
When the haploid gametes fuse, they form a diploid zygote.
It quickly undergoes meiosis to produce more haploid gametes that repeat the life cycle.
Diploid Life Cycle
Organisms with a diploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as diploid adults.
When they are ready to reproduce, they undergo meiosis and produce haploid gametes.
Gametes then unite in fertilization and form a diploid zygote, which immediately enters G 1 of the cell cycle.
Next, the zygote's DNA is replicated.
Finally, the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells.
Through repeated rounds of growth and division, this organism becomes a diploid adult and the cycle continues.
