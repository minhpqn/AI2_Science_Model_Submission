The cells of the blastocyst form an inner cell mass and an outer cell layer, as shown in Figure below .
The inner cell mass is called the embryoblast .
These cells will soon develop into an embryo.
The outer cell layer is called the trophoblast .
These cells will develop into other structures needed to support and nourish the embryo.
Blastocyst.
The blastocyst consists of an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast and an inner cell mass called the embryoblast.
The blastocyst fluid-filled cavity is also known as the blastocoel or blastocoele.
The blastocyst continues down the fallopian tube and reaches the uterus about 4 or 5 days after fertilization.
When the outer cells of the blastocyst contact cells of the endometrium lining the uterus, the blastocyst embeds in the endometrium.
The process of embedding is called implantation .
It generally occurs about a week after fertilization.
For a detailed look at fetal development, see
Fertilization is the union of a sperm and egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote.
The zygote undergoes many cell divisions before it implants in the lining of the uterus.
