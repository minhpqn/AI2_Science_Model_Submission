F_e=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{d^2}
The SI unit of charge is the coulomb, C , which is the charge of 6.25 \times 10^{18} electrons.
The charge on a single electron is  1.60 \times 10^{-19} \ C and is known as the elementary charge.
The electrical force is a vector quantity that is positive in repulsion and negative in attraction.
The following video covers Coulomb's Law.

Practice problems on Coulombâ€™s Law:
Suppose that two point charges, each with a charge of +1.00 C, are separated by a distance of 1.0 m:
Will the charges attract or repel?
What is the magnitude of the force between them?
If the distance between them is doubled, what does the force become?
What is the electrical force between two balloons, each having 5.00 C of charge, that are 0.300 m apart?
Two spheres are charged with the same charge of -0.0025 C and are separated by a distance of 8.00 m.  What is the electrical force between them?
A red foam ball and a blue foam ball are 4.00 m apart.
The blue ball has a charge of 0.000337 C and is attracting the red ball with a force of 626 N.
What is the charge on the red ball?
