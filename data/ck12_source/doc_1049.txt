What is Earth science?
Earth scientists seek to understand the beautiful sphere on which we live.
Earth is a very large, complex set of systems.
So most Earth scientists study one aspect of the planet.
Researchers work together to answer complicated questions.
The major branches of Earth science are described below.
Geology is the study of the solid Earth.
Geologists study how rocks and minerals form.
The way mountains rise up is part of geology.
The way mountains erode away is another part.
Geologists also study fossils and Earthâ€™s history.
There are many other branches of geology.
There is so much to know about our home planet that most geologists become specialists in one area.
For example, a mineralogist studies minerals ( Figure below ).
Geologists study minerals and earthquakes

Some volcanologists brave molten lava to study volcanoes.
Seismologists monitor earthquakes worldwide to help protect people and property from harm ( Figure above ).
Paleontologists are interested in fossils and how ancient organisms lived.
Scientists who compare the geology of other planets to Earth are planetary geologists.
