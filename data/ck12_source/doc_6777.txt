Power and Efficiency
Define and calculate power and efficiency.
Students will learn how to calculate power and efficiency.
Students will also learn the true meaning of both.
P = \frac{W} {\Delta t} ;
Power is equal to the energy released per second and has units of Watts ( 1 Watt = J/s).
\text{Eff} = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} ;
The efficiency equals the output power divided by the input power
Guidance Power is the rate at which energy is being transferred.
Power tells you how many Joules per second of energy is being used to drive something.
Thus power is simply the change in energy divided by the time.
Since work is by definition the transfer of energy (in or out of a system), power is also equal to the work divided by the time.
