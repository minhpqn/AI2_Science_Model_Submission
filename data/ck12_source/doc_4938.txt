Cell transport may require energy.
Some transport involves vesicles.
What is meant by cell transport?
Why is cell transport important?
List types of cell transport.
Explain how cell transport helps an organism maintain homeostasis.
Diffusion - Advanced
What will eventually happen to these dyes?
They will all blend together.
The dyes will move through the water until an even distribution, or equilibrium, is achieved.
The process of moving from areas of high amounts of a substance to areas of low amounts of the same substance is called diffusion.
Passive transport is a way that small molecules or ions move across the cell membrane without input of energy by the cell.
The three main kinds of passive transport are diffusion (or simple diffusion), osmosis, and facilitated diffusion.
Simple diffusion and osmosis do not involve transport proteins.
Facilitated diffusion requires the assistance of proteins.
Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration of the molecules to an area with a lower concentration.
For cell transport, diffusion is the movement of small molecules across the cell membrane.
The difference in the concentrations of the molecules in the two areas is called the concentration gradient .
The kinetic energy of the molecules results in random motion, causing diffusion.
In simple diffusion, this process proceeds without the aid of a transport protein. it is the random motion of the molecules that causes them to move from an area of high concentration to an area with a lower concentration.
