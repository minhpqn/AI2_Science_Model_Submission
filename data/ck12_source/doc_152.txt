Specialized Human Features
Specialized features of Homo sapiens include the following:
small front teeth (canines and incisors) and very large molars relative to other primate species,
a fully upright posture resulting in bipedalism (walking on two limbs instead of four),
shortening of the arms relative to the legs,
increased usefulness (dexterity) of the hands,
increase in brain size, especially in the frontal lobes
and a decrease in bone mass of the skull and face.
