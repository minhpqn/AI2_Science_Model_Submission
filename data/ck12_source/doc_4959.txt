Gradient established from a higher concentration of protons on one side of a membrane compared to the other side of the membrane.
proton motive force :
The storing of energy due to a combination of a proton gradient and a voltage gradient across a membrane.
resting potential :
The membrane potential of a cell/neuron at rest; the membrane potential of an unstimulated neuron.
voltage :
The difference in electrical potential energy of two points/areas; electrical potential energy that is caused by a separation of opposite charges.
The voltage across a membrane is the membrane potential and the membrane potential of a cell at rest is the resting potential.
The electrochemical gradient is composed of a chemical force (the ions' concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ionsâ€™ movement).
Chemiosmosis is the diffusion of protons across the biological membrane through ATP synthase, due to a proton gradient that forms across the membrane.
