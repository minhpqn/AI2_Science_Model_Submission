Distinguish between integral and peripheral membrane proteins.
Describe the structure and function of the membrane proteins.
Summarize the Fluid Mosaic Model.
Can anything or everything move in or out of the cell?
No.
It is the semipermeable plasma membrane that determines what can enter and leave the cell.
So, if not everything can cross the membrane, how do certain things get across?
The plasma membrane contains molecules other than phospholipids, primarily other lipids and proteins.
The green molecules in Figure below , for example, are the lipid cholesterol.
Molecules of cholesterol help the plasma membrane keep its shape.
Many of the proteins in the plasma membrane assist other substances in crossing the membrane.
The plasma membranes also contain certain types of proteins.
A membrane protein is a protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with, the membrane of a cell or an organelle.
Membrane proteins can be put into two groups based on how the protein is associated with the membrane.
Integral membrane proteins are permanently embedded within the plasma membrane.
They have a range of important functions.
Such functions include channeling or transporting molecules across the membrane.
Other integral proteins act as cell receptors.
Integral membrane proteins can be classified according to their relationship with the bilayer:
Transmembrane proteins span the entire plasma membrane.
