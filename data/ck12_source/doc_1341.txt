Why was it replaced by the Richter and then the moment magnitude scales?
Why do scientists prefer the moment magnitude scale to the Richter scale?
In 2011 there was a 5.8 magnitude quake that struck Virginia and a 9.0 quake that struck Japan.
How might a 5.8 quake rate on the Mercalli scale in Virginia?
How might a 5.8 magnitude quake rate on the Mercalli scale in Japan?
Identify factors that make an earthquake damaging and deadly.
Is earthquake magnitude the most important factor in determining damage?
The type of construction has a tremendous effect on what happens during an earthquake.
Damage and deaths are directly affected by the construction in an earthquake.
For example, enormous damage was done in the 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake.
However, far less was damaged in an earthquake of the same magnitude near the area in Iceland seen above.
Damage from Earthquakes
We know that earthquakes kill lots of people.
However, the ground shaking almost never kills people.
Unlike in cartoons, the ground does not swallow someone up!
Deaths depend somewhat on an earthquake's size and the type of ground people inhabit.
But a very important factor is the quality of the structures.
People are killed when structures fall on them.
More damage is done and more people are killed by the fires that follow an earthquake.
Of course, the number of deaths is different from the property damage that a quake does.
