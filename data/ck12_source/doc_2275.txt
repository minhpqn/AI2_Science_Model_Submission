This stretching of space, which causes the distance between galaxies to increase, is what astronomers mean by the expansion of the Universe.
One other difference between the Universe and our balloon model involves the actual size of the galaxies.
On the inflating balloon, the dots you made will become larger in size as you inflate it.
In our Universe, however, the galaxies stay the same size; it is just the space between the galaxies that increases as the Universe expands.
An animation of an expanding Universe is shown here:
Almost every galaxy is moving away from us.
The spectrum from stars is shifted toward the red; this is known as red-shift.
Red-shift of galaxies is evidence that the Universe is expanding.
Hubble's Law states that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us.
