Therefore, the chemical formula for water is:
H 2 O
The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in the molecule.
The O for oxygen has no subscript.
When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used in the chemical formula.
Formulas for Ionic and Covalent Compounds
The Table below shows four examples of compounds and their chemical formulas.
The first two compounds are ionic compounds, and the second two are covalent compounds.
Each formula shows the ratio of ions or atoms that make up the compound.
Name of Compound
Type of Compound
Ratio of Ions or Atoms of Each Element
1 sodium ion (Na + ) 1 chloride ion (Cl - )
1 calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) 2 iodide ions (I - )
2 hydrogen atoms (H) 2 oxygen atoms (O)
H 2 O 2
1 carbon atom (C) 2 oxygen atoms (O)
There is a different rule for writing the chemical formula for each type of compound.
Ionic compounds are compounds in which positive metal ions and negative nonmetal ions are joined by ionic bonds.
In these compounds, the chemical symbol for the positive metal ion is written first, followed by the symbol for the negative nonmetal ion.
