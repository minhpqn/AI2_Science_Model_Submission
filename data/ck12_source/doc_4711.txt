Left target:
High accuracy but low precision;
Right target: low accuracy but high precision.
The results of calculations or a measurement can be accurate but not precise; precise but not accurate; neither accurate nor precise; or accurate and precise.
A collection of bulls eyes right around the center of the target would be both accurate and precise.
An error is a boundary on the precision and accuracy of the result of a measurement.
Some errors are caused by unpredictable changes in the measuring devices (such as balances, rulers, or calipers), but other errors can be caused by reading a measuring device incorrectly or by using broken or malfunctioning equipment.
Such errors can have an impact on the reliability of the experimentâ€™s results; they affect the accuracy of measurements.
For example, you use a balance to obtain the mass of a 100 gram block.
Three measurements that you get are: 93.1 g, 92.0 g, and 91.8 g.
The measurements are precise, as they are close together, but they are not accurate.
If the cause of the error can be identified, then it can usually be eliminated or minimized.
Reducing the number of possible errors by careful measurement and using a large enough sample size to reduce the effect of errors will improve the reliability of your results.
After experiments have been performed, the results must be analyzed.
The data should either agree or disagree with your hypothesis.
Evidence that agrees with your prediction supports your hypothesis.
If the hypothesis is supported, the process moves forward and the scientist begins to think about the next steps.
If the data does not support the hypothesis, the hypothesis may need to be altered.
Does evidence that supports the hypothesis prove that your hypothesis is true?
No, not necessarily.
