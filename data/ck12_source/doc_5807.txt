What features describe the protozoa?
What are three main types of protozoa?
Distinguish flagellates from ciliates.
Distinguish algae from plants.
Give examples of multicellular plant-like protists.
What is pond scum?
Polluted water can form a frothy green scum on the surface.
This "pond scum" is actually a living organism, algae.
The algae are plant-like protists.
Usually the algae are too small to notice, but sometimes algae grow in excess because of the excess nutrients in polluted water.
Plant-like protists are known as algae ( Figure below ).
They are a large and diverse group.
Plant-like protists are autotrophs.
This means that they produce their own food.
They perform photosynthesis to produce sugar by using carbon dioxide and water, and the energy from sunlight, just like plants.
Unlike plants, however, plant-like protists do not have true stems, roots, or leaves.
Red algae are a group of protists
Red algae are a very large group of protists making up about 5,000â€“6,000 species.
They are mostly multicellular and live in the ocean.
Many red algae are seaweeds and help create coral reefs.
