The velocity of the wave's energy transfer is given by v=\lambda f  or  v=\frac{\lambda}{T}.
The following video explains wave characteristics.
Pause the video before each practice question and try to solve it yourself before moving on.

What is the distance between the base line and crest called?
What symbol is used for wavelength?
What is the relationship between period and frequency?
A sound wave produced by a chime 515 m away is heard 1.50 s later.
What is the speed of sound in air?
The sound wave has a frequency of 436 Hz.  What is its period?
What is the wavelength of the sound?
A hiker shouts toward a vertical cliff 685 m away.  The echo is heard 4.00 s later.
What is the speed of sound in air?
Why is this speed of sound slightly different from the previous answer?
The wavelength of the sound is 0.750 m.  What is the frequency?
What is the period of the wave?
The speed of light in air is 3.00 × 10 8 m/s.  If a light wave has a wavelength of 5.80 × 10 -7  m, what is its frequency?
transverse wave:
A transverse wave is a moving wave that consists of oscillations occurring perpendicular (or right angled) to the direction of energy transfer
undisturbed position:
