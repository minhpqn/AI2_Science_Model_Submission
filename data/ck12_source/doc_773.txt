Combined Series-Parallel Circuits
Solve problems of combined circuits.
Complicated circuit of a polynomial plotter
Electrical circuits can become immensely complicated.
This circuit is a polynomial plotter, which allows users to plot polynomials and evaluate functions at various x values.
Combined Series-Parallel Circuits
Most circuits are not just a series or parallel circuit; most have resistors in parallel and in series.
These circuits are called combination circuits .
When solving problems with such circuits, use this series of steps.
For resistors connected in parallel, calculate the single equivalent resistance that can replace them.
For resistors in series, calculate the single equivalent resistance that can replace them.
By repeating steps 1 and 2, you can continually reduce the circuit until only a single equivalent resistor remains.
Then you can determine the total circuit current.
The voltage drops and currents though individual resistors can then be calculated.
Example Problem:
In the combination circuit sketched below, find the equivalent resistance for the circuit, find the total current through the circuit, and find the current through each individual resistor.
Example problem circuit with a pair of parallel resistors in series with another resistor
Solution:
We start by simplifying the parallel resistors R_2 and R_3 .
\frac{1}{R_{23}}&=\frac{1}{180 \ \Omega}+\frac{1}{220 \ \Omega}=\frac1{99\ \Omega }\\R_{23}&=99 \ \Omega
