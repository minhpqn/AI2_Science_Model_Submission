The exosphere is the layer above the thermosphere.
This is the top of the atmosphere.
The exosphere has no real upper limit; it just gradually merges with outer space.
Gas molecules are very far apart in this layer, but they are really hot.
Earthâ€™s gravity is so weak in the exosphere that gas molecules sometimes just float off into space.
The solar wind is made of high speed particles from the Sun.
The magnetosphere protects Earth from the solar wind.
Particles from the Sun energize ions in the thermosphere.
This creates the northern and southern lights.
Gas molecules are exceedingly rare in the exosphere.
