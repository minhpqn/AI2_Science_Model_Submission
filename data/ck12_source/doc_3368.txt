The Figure below represents a simple doorbell.
Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door.
Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electric circuit.
In other words, the button is a switch.
The circuit is also connected to a source of current, an electromagnet, and a clapper that strikes a bell.
You can see an animation of a doorbell at this URL:
Schematic illustrating how a doorbell works
What happens when current flows through the doorbell circuit?
The electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper.
This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring.
Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit.
Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off, and the clapper returns to its original position.
When the clapper moves back to its original position, this closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on.
The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more.
This sequence of events keeps repeating.
Q:
How can you stop the sequence of events so the doorbell will stop ringing?
A:
Stop pressing the button!
This interrupts the circuit so no current can flow through it.
