Of course, many severe human phenotypes are inherited in a Mendelian fashion including Phenylketonuria (PKU), cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, hypercholesterolemia, and sickle-cell anemia.
These are termed genetic disorders and will be discussed in additional concepts.
Dominant and Recessive Alleles
Mendel used letters to represent dominant and recessive factors.
Likewise, geneticists now use letters to represent alleles.
Capital letters refer to dominant alleles, and lowercase letters refer to recessive alleles.
For example, the dominant allele for the trait of green pod color is indicated by G .
The recessive trait of yellow pod color is indicated by g .
A true-breeding plant for green pod color would have identical alleles GG in all its somatic cells.
Likewise, a true-breeding plant for yellow pod color would have identical alleles gg in all of its somatic cells.
During gamete formation, each gamete receives one copy of an allele.
When fertilization occurs between these plants, the offspring receives two copies of the allele, one from each parent.
In this case, all of the offspring would have two different alleles, Gg , one from each of its parents.
An organism that has an identical pair of alleles for a trait is called homozygous .
The true-breeding parents GG and gg are homozygous for the pod color gene.
Organisms that have two different alleles for a gene are called heterozygous ( Gg ).
The offspring of the cross between the GG (homozygous dominant) and gg (homozygous recessive) plants are all heterozygous for the pod color gene.
A homozygous individual is known as a homozygote, and a heterozygous individual is known as a heterozygote.
Due to dominance and recessiveness of alleles, an organism’s traits do not always reveal its genetics.
Therefore, geneticists distinguish between an organism’s genetic makeup, called its genotype , and its physical traits, called its phenotype .
