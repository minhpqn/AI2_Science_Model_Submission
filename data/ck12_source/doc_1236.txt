Is the theory of plate tectonics an example of how a theory comes to be?
Scientific ideas do not come to a scientist fully formed.
They usually start as observations.
Somewhere along the way the scientist develops a hypothesis.
The scientist finds evidence to support or refute the hypothesis.
If the evidence is in support, the idea evolves into something bigger.
By the time an idea is a theory it is extremely complex.
A theory has a tremendous amount of data to support it.
Nothing substantial refutes it.
It probably is extremely important in the area it addresses.
Plate tectonics provides a tremendous example of how a theory comes to be.
In this section we will follow the development of the theory of plate tectonics.
It begins as an observation on how South America and Africa fit together.
And becomes the framework on which much of geology hangs.
Identify the evidence Wegener had in support of his continental drift hypothesis.
Apply the steps of scientific method to Wegener's scientific investigation.
What does a scientist do with an interesting observation?
Alfred Wegener made an observation.
From that observation, he made a hypothesis.
He collected evidence that would support or refute his hypothesis.
