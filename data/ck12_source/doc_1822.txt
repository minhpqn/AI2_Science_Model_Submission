Wind can pick up soil and blow it far away.
Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion.
What are some human activities that increase soil erosion?
The photos below ( Figure below ) show how farming practices can increase soil erosion.
Plant roots penetrate the soil and keep it from eroding.
Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots.
Bare soil is exposed to wind and water.
In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting.
The problem doesnâ€™t stop with plowing.
Crops are usually planted in rows with bare soil in between the rows.
In places where crops grow only during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months.
How farming can increase soil erosion
Farming leaves some soil exposed to erosion.
The soil that is most likely to erode is the nutrient-rich topsoil.
The loss of topsoil degrades the farmland.
As pictured below ( Figure below ), some grazing animals, especially sheep and goats, eat grass right down to the roots.
They may even pull the grass entirely out of the ground.
Grazing animals can kill the grass.
They may thin it out so much that it offers little protection to the soil.
If animals are kept in the same place too long, the soil may become completely bare.
