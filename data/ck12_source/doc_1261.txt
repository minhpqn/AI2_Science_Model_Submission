Describe how plates move.
Explain a convection cell.
Describe seafloor spreading.
What is tectonics?
Dividing the lithosphere into plates is one thing.
Having the plates move around on the planet is another!
A conveyor belt is a good analogy for how a plate moves.
How the plates move and where they move is the "tectonics" part of plate tectonics.
Scientists have determined the direction that each plate is moving ( Figure below ).
Plates move around the Earth’s surface at a rate of a few centimeters a year.
This is about the same rate that fingernails grow.
Map of Earth's tectonic plates
Earth's plates are shown in different colors.
Arrows show the direction the plate is moving.
How Plates Move
Convection within the Earth’s mantle causes the plates to move.
Mantle material is heated above the core.
The hot mantle rises up toward the surface ( Figure below ).
As the mantle rises, it cools.
At the surface, the material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest.
