What is a geometric isomer?
Could 1-butene have geometric isomers?
geometric isomers:
Isomers in which the order of atom bonding is the same but the arrangement of atoms in space is different.
isomers:
Molecules with the same molecular formulas, but different arrangements of atoms.
structural isomer:
One in which two or more or organic compounds have the same molecular formulas but different structures.
Define cyclic hydrocarbon.
Draw structures and name typical cyclic hydrocarbons.
Nylon balloons are synthesized starting from benzene
From Benzene To Balloons
Although cyclohexane can be isolated from petroleum products, a major source of this chemical is the hydrogenation of benzene.
Much of the cyclohexane produced is used to manufacture intermediates for the production of nylon.
The nylon balloons pictured above no doubt had their start in a chemical plant where hydrogen gas and benzene were reacted at high temperatures to form cyclohexane.
This cycloalkane then undergoes nitration to begin the process of forming the long strands of nylon that can be made into balloons, ropes, clothing, and many other useful products.
A cyclic hydrocarbon is a hydrocarbon in which the carbon chain joins to itself in a ring.
A cycloalkane is a cyclic hydrocarbon in which all of the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds.
Like other alkanes, cycloalkanes are saturated compounds.
Cycloalkanes have the general formula of C n H 2n .
