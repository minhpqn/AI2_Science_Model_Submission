Anaerobic respiration is less energy-efficient, but allows survival in habitats which lack oxygen.
Within the human body, both are important to muscle function.
Muscle cells specialized for aerobic respiration provide endurance, and those specialized for lactic acid fermentation support short but intense energy expenditures.
Both ways of making ATP play critical roles in life on earth.
aerobic respiration :
Cellular respiration in the presence of oxygen; produces 36-38 ATP molecules/glucose.
anaerobic respiration :
Cellular respiration in the absence of oxygen; produces 2 ATP molecules/glucose; fermentation.
antioxidant :
A molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules.
fermentation :
Type of anaerobic respiration that includes glycolysis followed by the conversion of pyruvic acid to one or more other compounds and the formation of NAD + ; the process of producing ATP in the absence of oxygen through glycolysis.
glycogen :
A carbohydrate used for long-term energy storage in animal cells; human muscle and liver cells store energy in this form.
lactic acid fermentation :
The process for making ATP in the absence of oxygen; converts glucose to lactic acid.
obligate anaerobe :
An organism which uses anaerobic respiration, and dies in the presence of oxygen.
Aerobic respiration is far more energy-efficient than anaerobic respiration.
Aerobic processes produce up to 38 ATP per glucose.
