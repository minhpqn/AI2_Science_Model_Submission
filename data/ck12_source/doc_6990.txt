Calculate the minimum length flat mirror that Marjan would need to see her body from eye level all the way down to her feet.
Sketch at least 3 ray traces from her eyes showing the topmost, bottommost, and middle rays.
Consider a concave mirror with a focal length equal to two units, as shown below.
Carefully trace three rays coming off the top of the object in order to form the image.
Measure d_o and d_i .
Use the mirror/lens equation to calculate d_i .
Find the percent difference between your measured d_i and your calculated d_i .
Measure the magnification M and compare it to the calculated magnification.
Consider a concave mirror with unknown focal length that produces a virtual image six units behind the mirror.
Calculate the focal length of the mirror and draw an \times at the position of the focus.
Carefully trace three rays coming off the top of the object and show how they converge to form the image.
Does your image appear bigger or smaller than the object?
Calculate the expected magnification and compare it to your sketch.
Consider a convex mirror with a focal length equal to two units.
Carefully trace three rays coming off the top of the object and form the image.
Measure d_o and d_i .
Use the mirror/lens equation to calculate d_i .
Find the percent difference between your measured d_i and your calculated d_i .
Measure the magnification M and compare it to the calculated magnification.
Above is a diagram showing how to make a “ghost light bulb.” The real light bulb is below the box and it forms an image of the exact same size right above it.
