What is the result of this?
What are two examples of this type of plate boundary?
At what type of plate boundary are the highest peaks on Earth located?
Where is the continental crust thickest on Earth?
Compare and contrast these two types of convergent plate boundaries: (1) continent-continent, and (2) ocean-continent.
What causes mountain ranges to rise at convergent plate boundaries?
How did the Appalachian Mountains form?
Define continental margin.
Compare active continental margins to passive continental margins.
Can plate tectonics explain the differences in these beaches?
Plate tectonics explains why some beaches have lots of cliffs and some do not.
A beach with lots of cliffs is near a plate boundary.
A gentle beach is not.
There are exceptions to this rule, but it works in some cases.
Think of a continent, like North America.
Surrounding the continent are continental margins .
Continental crust grades into oceanic crust at continental margins.
Continental margins are under water.
Almost all of North America sits on the North American Plate ( Figure below ).
Both sides of the continent have continental margins, but each is very different.
