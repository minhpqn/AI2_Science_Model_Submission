The collagen triple helix molecule.
The three strands, each its own polypeptide, wind together to form the triple helix structure.
This requires a glycine residue every third amino acid.
See  for additional information on collagen.
The best characterized example of multiple alleles in humans is the ABO blood groups, discussed in the Non-Mendelian Inheritance concept.
Other human traits determined by multiple alleles would be hair color, hair texture, eye color, built, physical structures, etc.
Most, if not all of these multiple-allele traits are in traits with very diverse phenotypic possibilities.
It is easiest to consider situations where each gene affects only one phenotypic characteristic.
However, other situations where genes have other effects are common.
As mentioned above, multiple alleles resulting in multiple phenotypes are not uncommon.
Many genes have multiple phenotypic effects, a property called pleiotropy .
Thus, a new mutation in the gene will affect all the phenotypes/traits associated with the gene simultaneously.
For example, the symptoms associated with sickle-cell disease are due to pleiotropic effects.
Individuals with sickle-cell disease are homozygous for the mutant allele, resulting in sickle-shaped red blood cells.
Because the sickle-shaped red blood cells deliver less oxygen to the tissues, sickle-cell disease has many pleiotropic effects.
Symptoms include pain in the bones of the back, the long bones, and the chest.
As the disease progresses, additional symptoms develop.
These include fatigue, paleness, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice).
People with sickle cell trait are heterozygous for the mutation.
They do not have the symptoms of sickle cell anemia.
