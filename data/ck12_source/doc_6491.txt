This makes the zinc electrode the anode and the copper electrode the cathode.
When the same half-cells are connected to a battery via the external wire, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction.
The zinc electrode is now the cathode and the copper electrode is the anode.
& \text{oxidation (anode)} && \text{Cu}(s) \rightarrow \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- && E^0 =-0.34 \text{ V} \\& \text{reduction (cathode)} && \text{Zn}^{2+} (aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Zn}(s) && E^0 = -0.76 \text{ V} \\\hline& \text{overall reaction} && \text{Cu}(s)+\text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq)+\text{Zn}(s) && E^0{_\text{cell}} =-1.10 \text{ V}
The standard cell potential is negative, indicating a nonspontaneous reaction.
The battery must be capable of delivering at least 1.10 V of direct current in order for the reaction to occur.
Another difference between a voltaic cell and an electrolytic cell is the signs of the electrodes.
In a voltaic cell, the anode is negative and the cathode is positive.
In an electrolytic cell, the anode is positive because it is connected to the positive terminal of the battery.
The cathode is therefore negative.
Electrons still flow through the cell form the anode to the cathode.
The function of an electrolytic cell is described.
Reactions illustrating electrolysis are given.
