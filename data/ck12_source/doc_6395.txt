But, sulfuric acid is hazardous stuff, so the batteries are now sealed to protect people.
Beacuse of the acid's dangerous nature, it is not a good idea to cut into a battery to see what it looks like – you could get acid burns.
The Ion-Product of Water
The self-ionization of water (the process in which water ionizes to hydronium ions and hydroxide ions) occurs to a very limited extent.
When two molecules of water collide, there can be a transfer of a hydrogen ion from one molecule to the other.
The products are a positively charged hydronium ion and a negatively charged hydroxide ion.
\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{H}_3\text{O}^+(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq)
We often use the simplified form of the reaction:
\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{H}^+(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq)
The equilibrium constant for the self-ionization of water is referred to as the ion-product for water and is given the symbol K_w .
K_w = [ \text{H}^+ ][ \text{OH}^- ]
The ion-product of water  (K_w) is the mathematical product of the concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions.
Note that H 2 O is not included in the ion-product expression because it is a pure liquid.
The value of  K_w is very small, in accordance with a reaction that favors the reactants.
At 25°C, the experimentally determined value of  K_w in pure water is 1.0 × 10 -14 .
K_w=[\text{H}^+][\text{OH}^-]=1.0 \times 10^{-14}
In pure water, the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions are equal to one another.
Pure water or any other aqueous solution in which this ratio holds is said to be neutral.
To find the molarity of each ion, the square root of  K_w is taken.
[\text{H}^+]=[\text{OH}^-]=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \ \text{M}
