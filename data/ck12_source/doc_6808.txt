If a boy of 50\;\mathrm{kg} hangs from the rope, how far will it stretch?
If the boy kicks himself up a bit, and then is bouncing up and down ever so slightly, what is his frequency of oscillation?
Would he notice this oscillation?
If so, how?
If not, why not?
If a 5.0\;\mathrm{kg} mass attached to a spring oscillates 4.0 times every second, what is the spring constant k of the spring?
A horizontal spring attached to the wall is attached to a block of wood on the other end.
All this is sitting on a frictionless surface.
The spring is compressed 0.3\;\mathrm{m} .
Due to the compression there is 5.0\;\mathrm{J} of energy stored in the spring.
The spring is then released.
The block of wood experiences a maximum speed of 25\;\mathrm{m/s} .
Find the value of the spring constant.
Find the mass of the block of wood.
What is the equation that describes the position of the mass?
What is the equation that describes the speed of the mass?
Draw three complete cycles of the blockâ€™s oscillatory motion on an x vs. t graph.
A spider of 0.5\;\mathrm{g} walks to the middle of her web.
The web sinks by 1.0\;\mathrm{mm} due to her weight.
You may assume the mass of the web is negligible.
