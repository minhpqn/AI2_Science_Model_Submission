But some worms, such as the above Dugesia flatworm, do have eyespots.
These are not exactly like your eyes, however.
Eyespots can only detect light in their environment.
The word "worm" is not very scientific.
But it is a word that informally describes animals (usually invertebrates) that have long bodies with no arms or legs. (Snakes are vertebrates, so they are not usually described as worms.) Worms are the first significant group of animals with bilateral symmetry, meaning that the right side of their bodies is a mirror of the left.
One type of worm is the flatworm .
Worms in the phylum Platyhelminthes are called flatworms because they have flattened bodies.
There are more than 18,500 known species of flatworms.
Features of Flatworms
The main characteristics of flatworms ( Figure below ) include:
Flatworms have no true body cavity, but they do have bilateral symmetry.
Due to the lack of a body cavity,flatworms are known as acoelomates.
Flatworms have an incomplete digestive system.
This means that the digestive tract has only one opening.
Digestion takes place in the gastrovascular cavity.
Flatworms do not have a respiratory system.
Instead, they have pores that allow oxygen to enter through their body.
Oxygen enters the pores by diffusion.
There are no blood vessels in the flatworms.
Their gastrovascular cavity helps distribute nutrients throughout the body.
