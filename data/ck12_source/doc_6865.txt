Plants then pass along those minerals and nutrients to the animals that eat the plants.
Arthropods are also invaluable to humans, as they are used in many different human-made products.
Examples are:
Bees produce honey and their honeycombs contain beeswax, widely used for making candles, furniture wax and polishes, waxed papers, antiseptics, and fillings for surgical uses.
The pollens stored in honeycombs were discovered to have a rich mixture of vitamins, enzymes, and amino acids that could provide medical benefits.
They were used as ingredients for supplements and medications that could provide relief for colds, asthma, and hay fever.
Silk produced by arthropods, like those produced by caterpillars to protect their cocoons, is strong enough to use and be woven into fabrics, a discovery first used in ancient China's silk industry.
The spidersâ€™ web was discovered as an additional material that could provide strength, and has became essential raw materials for Kevlar vests, fishing nets, surgical sutures, and adhesives, as they contained natural antiseptics.
Many crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters, shrimp, prawns, and crayfish, are food sources for humans.
Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are decomposers, meaning they break down dead plants and animals and turn them into soil nutrients.
