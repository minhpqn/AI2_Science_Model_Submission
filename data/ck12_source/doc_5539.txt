Both are used in the development of scientific ideas.
Inductive reasoning first involves the collection of data.
If I add sodium metal to water, I will observe a very violent reaction.
Every time I repeat the process, I see the same thing happening.
I draw a general conclusion from these observations: the addition of sodium to water results in a violent reaction.
In deductive reasoning, I make a specific prediction based on a general principle.
One general principle is that acids turn blue litmus paper red.
If I have a bottle of liquid labeled “acid,” I expect the litmus paper to turn red when I immerse it in the liquid.
The Idea of the Experiment
Inductive reasoning is at the heart of what we call the “ scientific method. ” In European culture, this approach was developed mainly by Francis Bacon (1561-1626), a British scholar.
He advocated the use of inductive reasoning in every area of life, not just science.
The scientific method as developed by Bacon and others involved several steps:
ask a question – identify the problem to be considered
make observations – gather data that pertains to the question
propose an explanation ( a hypothesis) for the observations
make new observations to test the hypothesis further

Note that this should not be considered a “cookbook” for scientific research.
Scientists do not sit down with their daily “to do” list and write down these steps.
