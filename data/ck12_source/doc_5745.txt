They are one of three classes of elements (the other two classes are metals and metalloids.) Nonmetals are the second largest of the three classes after metals.
They are the elements located on the right side of the periodic table.
Q:
From left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table, each element has atoms with one more proton and one more electron than the element before it.
How might this be related to the properties of nonmetals?
A:
Because nonmetals are on the right side of the periodic table, they have more electrons in their outer energy level than elements on the left side or in the middle of the periodic table.
The number of electrons in the outer energy level of an atom determines many of its properties.
Properties of Nonmetals
As their name suggests, nonmetals generally have properties that are very different from the properties of metals.
Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, which explains why many of them are gases at room temperature.
However, some nonmetals are solids at room temperature, including the three pictured above, and one nonmetal—bromine—is a liquid at room temperature.
Other properties of nonmetals are illustrated and described in the Table below .

Reactivity of Nonmetals
Reactivity is how likely an element is to react chemically with other elements.
Some nonmetals are extremely reactive, whereas others are completely nonreactive.
What explains this variation in nonmetals?
The answer is their number of valence electrons.
These are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in interactions with other atoms.
