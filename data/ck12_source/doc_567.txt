This tail is a long flagella that pushes the sperm forward.
A sperm can travel about 30 inches per hour.
This may not sound very fast, but don’t forget how small a sperm is.
For its size, a sperm moves about as fast as you do when you walk briskly.
To make sperm, cells start in the testes and end in the epididymis.
It takes up to two months to make sperm.
The steps are explained below:
Special cells in the testes go through mitosis (cell division) to make identical copies of themselves.
The copies of the original cells divide by meiosis , producing cells called spermatids .
The spermatids have half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.
The spermatids are immature and cannot move on their own.
The spermatids are transported from the testes to the epididymis.
Involuntary muscular contraction moves the spermatids along.
In the epididymis , spermatids slowly grow older and mature.
They grow a tail.
They also lose some of the cytoplasm from the head.
It is here that the spermatids mature, becoming sperm cells.
When sperm are mature, they can “swim.” The mature sperm are stored in the epididymis until it is time for them to leave the body.
Sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens .
As they travel through the vas deferens, they pass by the prostate and other glands.
