These bags of blood will be stored until they are needed for a transfusion.
But what exactly is blood?
What makes up the blood?
Most of your blood is water.
However, there are also many other important components of your blood.
Components of Blood
Did you know that blood is a tissue?
Blood is a fluid connective tissue that is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.
The cells that make up blood are pictured below ( Figure below ).
The different parts of blood have different roles.

Red blood cells are the flat, bowl-shaped cells, the tiny disc-shaped pieces are platelets, and white blood cells are the round cells shown in the center.
If you were to filter out all the cells in blood, a golden-yellow liquid would be left behind.
Plasma is this fluid part of the blood.
Plasma is about 90% water and about 10% dissolved proteins, glucose, ions, hormones, and gases.
Blood is made up mostly of plasma.
Red Blood Cells
Red blood cells (RBCs) are flattened, disk-shaped cells that carry oxygen.
They are the most common blood cell in the blood.
