The skin is the major organ of the integumentary system , which also includes the nails and hair.
In fact, the skin is the bodyâ€™s largest organ, and a remarkable one at that.
Consider these skin facts.
The average square inch (6.5 cm 2 ) of skin has 20 blood vessels, 650 sweat glands, and more than a thousand nerve endings.
It also has an incredible 60,000 pigment-producing cells.
All of these structures are packed into a stack of cells that is just 2 mm thick, or about as thick as the cover of a book.

Although the skin is thin, it consists of two distinct layers, called the epidermis and the dermis.
These layers are shown in Figure below .

Layers of Human Skin.
The outer layer of the skin is the epidermis, and the inner layer is the dermis.
Most skin structures originate in the dermis.
The epidermis is the outer layer of skin, consisting of epithelial cells and little else (see Figure below ).
For example, there are no nerve endings or blood vessels in the epidermis.
The innermost cells of the epidermis are continuously dividing through mitosis to form new cells.
