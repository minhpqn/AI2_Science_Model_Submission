ATP is generated during the process.
Though this equation may not seem that complicated, cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions divided into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.
Stage one of cellular respiration is glycolysis.
Glycolysis is the splitting, or lysis of glucose.
Glycolysis converts the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.
This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, and it occurs in the presence or absence of oxygen.
During glycolysis a small amount of NADH is made as are four ATP.
Two ATP are used during this process, leaving a net gain of two ATP from glycolysis.  The NADH temporarily holds energy, which will be used in stage three.
The Krebs Cycle
In the presence of oxygen, under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria to proceed into the Krebs cycle.
The second stage of cellular respiration is the transfer of the energy in pyruvate, which is the energy initially in glucose, into two energy carriers, NADH and FADH 2 .
A small amount of ATP is also made during this process.
This process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after its discover, Hans Krebs.
The Krebs cycle uses a 2-carbon molecule (acetyl-CoA) derived from pyruvate and produces carbon dioxide.
The Electron Transport Chain
Stage three of cellular respiration is the use of NADH and FADH 2 to generate ATP.
This occurs in two parts.
First, the NADH and FADH 2 enter an electron transport chain, where their energy is used to pump, by active transport, protons (H + ) out of the thylakoid.
This establishes a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane.
