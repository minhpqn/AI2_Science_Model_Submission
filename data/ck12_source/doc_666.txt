What is the frequency heard by a person driving at 15 m/s toward a blowing factory whistle if the emitted frequency is 800.
Hz and the speed of sound is 340. m/s?
While standing near a railroad crossing, a person hears a distant train horn.
According to the trainâ€™s engineer, the frequency emitted by the horn is 440 Hz and the train is traveling toward the railroad crossing at 20.0 m/s.
If the speed of sound is 340 m/s, what frequency will the observer hear?
After the train passed the person at the crossing, what frequency would he hear?
Doppler effect:
The shift in frequency of wave form energy emitted by a source moving relative to an observer as perceived by the observer: the shift is to higher frequencies when the source approaches and to lower frequencies when it recedes.
Reflection of Mechanical Waves
State the law of reflection.
Solve problems using the law of reflection.
Given data about the media on either side of a barrier, determine whether the reflected wave will be upright or inverted.
Wave reflecting off a barrier
When mechanical waves strike a barrier, at least part of the energy of the waves will be reflected back into the media from which they came.
You experience this every single day, when you look in the mirror and see your own reflection.
Reflection of Mechanical Waves
When a wave strikes an obstacle or comes to the end of the medium it is traveling in, some portion of the wave is reflected back into the original medium.
It reflects back at an equal angle that it came in.
These angles are called the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection .
The normal line, the incident and reflected rays, and the angles of incidence and reflection are all shown in the diagram sketched above.
