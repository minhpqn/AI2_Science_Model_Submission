a. 224 \;\mathrm{V} b. 448 \;\mathrm{W} c. 400 \;\mathrm{W} by 100 \ \Omega and 48 \;\mathrm{W} by 12 \ \Omega
a. 0.013 A b. 0.27 A c.  120 \Omega  and  180 \Omega
need about  202 \Omega  of total resistance.
So if you wire up the  120 \Omega  and the  82 \Omega  in series, you'll have it.
Resistors in Parallel
Analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in parallel.
Students will learn how to analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in parallel.
\frac{1} {R_{total}} = \frac{1} {R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1} {R_3} + \ldots
Resistors in Parallel:
All resistors are connected together at both ends.
There are many rivers (i.e.
The main river branches off into many other rivers), so all resistors receive different amounts of current.
But since they are all connected to the same point at both ends they all receive the same voltage.
A circuit is wired up with 2 resistors in parallel.
Both resistors are directly connected to the power supply, so both have the same 20V across them.
But they are on different ‘rivers’ so they have different current flowing through them.
Lets go through the same questions and answers as with the circuit in series.
Question:
What is the total resistance of the circuit?
