In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves, and then the waves are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower.
A radio receiver detects the waves and changes them back to sounds.
You may have listened to both AM and FM radio stations.
How sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between AM and FM broadcasts.
AM stands for a mplitude m odulation.
In AM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude, or maximum height, of radio waves.
AM broadcasts use longer wavelength radio waves than FM broadcasts.
Because of their longer wavelengths, AM waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere.
You can see how this happens in the Figure below .
Because the waves are reflected, they can reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower.
FM stands for f requency m odulation.
In FM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves.
Frequency modulation allows FM waves to encode more information than does amplitude modulation, so FM broadcasts usually produce clearer sounds than AM broadcasts.
However, the relatively short wavelengths of FM waves means that they donâ€™t reflect off the ionosphere as AM waves do.
Instead, FM waves pass through the ionosphere and out into space.
This is also shown in the Figure below .
As a result, FM waves cannot reach very distant receivers.

Q:
The composition of the ionosphere changes somewhat from day to night.
