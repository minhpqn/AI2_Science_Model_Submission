It would have lacked a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.

Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration
The earliest cells were probably heterotrophs .
Most likely they got their energy from other molecules in the organic “soup.” However, by about 3 billion years ago, a new way of obtaining energy evolved.
This new way was photosynthesis .
Through photosynthesis, organisms could use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water.
These organisms were the first autotrophs .
They provided food for themselves and for other organisms that began to consume them.
After photosynthesis evolved, oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere.
This has been dubbed the “oxygen catastrophe.” Why?
Oxygen was toxic to most early cells because they had evolved in its absence.
As a result, many of them died out.
The few that survived evolved a new way to take advantage of the oxygen.
This second major innovation was cellular respiration .
It allowed cells to use oxygen to obtain more energy from organic molecules.
The first cells consisted of little more than an organic molecule such as RNA inside a lipid membrane.
One cell (or group of cells), called the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), gave rise to all subsequent life on Earth.
Photosynthesis evolved by 3 billion years ago and released oxygen into the atmosphere.
Cellular respiration evolved after that to make use of the oxygen.
