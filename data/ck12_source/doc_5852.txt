Chemical symbols are like shorthand
How does shorthand work?
Shorthand was a very popular way of recording speech, especially in dictating letters and in court testimony.
Instead of trying to write out all the words, the person taking the dictation would use a set of symbols that represented syllables or words.
The pages above show a shorthand version of “A Christmas Carol” written by Charles Dickens.
Unless you know shorthand, the passage is meaningless.
But knowing shorthand allows you to read this classic story.
Different professions also use a type of shorthand in communication to save time.  Chemists use chemical symbols in combination to indicate specific compounds.  There are two advantages to this approach:
The compound under discussion is clearly described so there can be no confusion about its identity.
Chemical symbols represent a universal language that all chemists can understand, no matter what their native language is.
