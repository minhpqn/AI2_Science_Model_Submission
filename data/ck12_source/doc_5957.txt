1 mol = 22.4 L
density = ? g/L
Molar mass divided by molar volume yields the gas density at STP.
Step 2:
Calculate.
\frac{28.02 \ \text{g}}{1 \ \text{mol}} \times \frac{1 \ \text{mol}}{22.4 \ \text{L}}=1.25 \ \text{g} / \text{L}
When set up with a conversion factor, the mol unit cancels, leaving g/L as the unit in the result.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The molar mass of nitrogen is slightly larger than molar volume, so the density is slightly greater than 1 g/L.
Alternatively, the molar mass of a gas can be determined if the density of the gas at STP is known.
Sample Problem Two:
Molar Mass from Gas Density
What is the molar mass of a gas whose density is 0.761 g/L at STP?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
N 2 = 28.02 g/mol
1 mol = 22.4 L
molar mass = ? g/L
Molar mass is equal to density multiplied by molar volume.
