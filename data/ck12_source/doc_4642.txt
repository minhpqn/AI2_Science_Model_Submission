After menstruation, the endometrium begins to build up again.
At the same time, a follicle starts maturing in an ovary.
Ovulation occurs around day 14 of the cycle.
After it occurs, the endometrium continues to build up in preparation for a fertilized egg.
What happens next depends on whether the egg is fertilized.
If the egg is fertilized, the endometrium will be maintained and help nourish the egg.
The ruptured follicle, now called the corpus luteum , will secrete the hormone progesterone .
This hormone keeps the endometrium from breaking down.
If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will break down and disappear.
Without progesterone, the endometrium will also break down and be shed.
A new menstrual cycle thus begins.
For most women, menstrual cycles continue until their mid- or late- forties.
Then women go through menopause , a period during which their menstrual cycles slow down and eventually stop, generally by their early fifties.
After menopause, women can no longer reproduce naturally because their ovaries no longer produce eggs.
The menstrual cycle includes events that take place in the ovary, such as ovulation.
The menstrual cycle also includes changes in the uterus, including menstruation.
Menopause occurs when menstruation stops occurring, usually in middle adulthood.
