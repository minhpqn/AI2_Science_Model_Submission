86.5 L H 2
1 mol = 22.4 L
moles of H 2
Apply a conversion factor to convert from liters to moles.
Step 2:
Calculate.
86.5 \ \text{L H}_2 \times \frac{1 \ \text{mol H}_2}{22.4 \ \text{L H}_2}=3.86 \ \text{mol H}_2
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The volume of gas produced is nearly four times larger than the molar volume.  The fact that the gas is hydrogen plays no role in the calculation.
Sample Problem Two:
Converting Moles to Gas Volume
What volume does 4.96 moles of O 2 occupy at STP?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
4.96 moles O 2
1 mol = 22.4 L
volume of O 2
Step 2:  Calculate.
4.96 \ \text{moles} \times \ \ {22.4 \ \text{liters/mole}}=111.1 \ \text{liters}
