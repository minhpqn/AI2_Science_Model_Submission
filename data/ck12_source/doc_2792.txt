In a solution, the solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that does the dissolving.
For a given solvent, some solutes have greater solubility than others.
For example, sugar is much more soluble in water than is salt.
But even sugar has an upper limit on how much can dissolve.
In a half liter of 20 °C water, the maximum amount is 1000 grams.
If you add more sugar than this, the extra sugar won’t dissolve.
You can compare the solubility of sugar, salt, and some other solutes in the Table below .

Grams of Solute that Will Dissolve in 0.5 L of Water (20 °C)
Q:
How much salt do you think Rhonda added to the half-liter of water in her experiment?
A:
The solubility of salt is 180 grams per half liter of water at 20 °C.
If Rhonda had added less than 180 grams of salt to the half-liter of water, then all of it would have dissolved.
Because some of the salt did not dissolve, she must have added more than 180 grams of salt to the water.
Factors That Affect Solubility
Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute.
Temperature is one such factor.
How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in the Figure below .
