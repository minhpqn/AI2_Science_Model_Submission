A star generates energy by nuclear fusion reactions.
Most of these stars are like our Sun.
However, some stars are smaller than our Sun, and some are larger.
Except for our own Sun, all stars are so far away that they only look like single pointsâ€”even through a telescope.
The stars that make up a constellation appear close to each other from Earth.
In reality, they may be very distant from one another.
Constellations were important to people, like the Ancient Greeks.
People who spent a lot of time outdoors at night, like shepherds, named the constellations.
They told stories about them.
Pictured below is one of the most easily recognized constellations ( Figure below ).
The ancient Greeks thought this group of stars looked like a hunter.
They named it Orion, after a great hunter in Greek mythology.

Orion has three stars that make up his belt.
Orion's belt is fairly easy to see in the night sky.
The constellations stay the same night after night.
The patterns of the stars never change.
However, each night the constellations move across the sky.
They move because Earth is spinning on its axis.
The constellations also move with the seasons.
