What is a Hero’s Engine?
How does Newton’s First Law of Motion have to do with the Hero’s Engine?
Why does the yellow ball go further?
A car of mass 1200 kg traveling westward at 30. m/s is slowed to a stop in a distance of 50. m by the car’s brakes.
What was the braking force?
Calculate the average force that must be exerted on a 0.145 kg baseball in order to give it an acceleration of 130 m/s 2 .
After a rocket ship going from the Earth to the moon leaves the gravitational pull of the Earth, it can shut off its engine and the ship will continue on to the moon due to the gravitational pull of the moon.
If a space ship traveling at 1000 miles per hour enters an area free of gravitational forces, its engine must run at some minimum level in order to maintain the ships velocity.
Suppose a space ship traveling at 1000 miles per hour enters an area free of gravitational forces and free of air resistance.
If the pilot wishes to slow the ship down, he can accomplish that by shutting off the engine for a while.
force:
A push or pull on an object.

Newton's third law would prevent the proposed space elevator from falling to Earth
The image above is a NASA artist’s conceptual illustration of a space elevator.
It was imagined as a geo-stationary transfer station for passengers and cargo between Earth and space.
This idea was not pursued beyond the initial discussion and evaluation stage, but the scientists involved believe the concept will become truly possible with the expected technological advances of the late 21 st century.
