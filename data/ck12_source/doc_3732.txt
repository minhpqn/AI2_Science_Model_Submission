For example, the amino acid lysine has the codon AAG, so the anticodon is UUC.
Therefore, lysine would be carried by a tRNA molecule with the anticodon UUC.
Wherever the codon AAG appears in mRNA, a UUC anticodon on a tRNA temporarily binds to the codon.
While bound to the mRNA, the tRNA gives up its amino acid.
Bonds form between adjacent amino acids as they are brought one by one to the ribosome, forming a polypeptide chain.
The chain of amino acids keeps growing until a stop codon is reached.

Structure of tRNA
The tRNA structure is a very important aspect in its role.
Though the molecule folds into a 3-leaf clover structure, notice the anticodon arm in the lower segment of the molecule, with the amino acid attached at the opposite end of the molecule (acceptor stem).
It is the anticodon that determines which codon in the mRNA the tRNA will bind to.
After a polypeptide chain is synthesized, it may undergo additional processes.
For example, it may assume a folded shape due to interactions among its amino acids.
It may also bind with other polypeptides or with different types of molecules, such as lipids or carbohydrates.
Many proteins travel to the Golgi apparatus to be modified for the specific job they will do.
You can see how this occurs by watching the animation at this link:
Translation is the RNA â†’ Protein part of the central dogma.
Translation occurs at a ribosome.
During translation, a protein is synthesized using the codons in mRNA as a guide.
All three types of RNA play a role in translation.
