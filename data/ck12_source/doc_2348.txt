What is an observation?
What senses can we use to make observations?
Why are observations important to scientific investigations?
State two criteria of a scientific hypothesis.
Explain why a hypothesis cannot be proven true.
Although this cartoon pokes fun at scientific hypotheses, the concept of hypothesis is one of the most important in science.
Scientific investigations discover evidence that helps science advance, and the purpose of scientific investigations generally is to test hypotheses.
Finding evidence to support or disprove hypotheses is how science advances.
What Is a Scientific Hypothesis?
The word hypothesis can be defined as an "educated guess." For example, it might be an educated guess about why a natural event occurs.
But not all hypotheses—even those about the natural world—are scientific hypotheses.
What makes a statement a scientific hypothesis rather than just an educated guess?
A scientific hypothesis must meet two criteria:
A scientific hypothesis must be testable.
A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable.
A Scientific Hypothesis Must Be Testable
For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make observations that agree or disagree with it.
If a hypothesis cannot be tested by making observations, it is not scientific.
Consider this statement:
"There are invisible creatures all around us that we can never observe in any way."
