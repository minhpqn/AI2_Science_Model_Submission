These two rays can be seen in the image below.
The two reflected rays intersect after reflection at a point between C  and F .
Since these two rays come from the tip of the object, they will form the tip of the image.
Reflected rays off a concave mirror
If the image is actually drawn in at the intersection of the two rays, it will be smaller and inverted, as shown below.
Rays from every point on the object could be drawn so that every point could be located to draw the image.
The result would be the same as shown here.
This is true for all concave mirrors with the object outside C : the image will be between C  and F , and the image will be inverted and diminished (smaller than the object).
Image formed by a concave mirror
The heights of the object and the image are related to their distances from the mirror.
In fact, the ratio of their heights is the same ratio as their distances from the mirror.
If d_o  is object distance, d_i the image distance, h_o  the object height and h_i  the image height, then
It can also be shown that \frac{d_o}{d_i}=\frac{d_o-f}{f}  and from this, we can derive the mirror equation ,
In this equation, f  is the focal length d o  is the object distance, and d i  is the image distance.
The magnification equation for a mirror is the image size divided by the object size, where  m  gives the magnification of the image.
Example Problem:
A 1.50 cm tall object is placed 20.0 cm from a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 30.0 cm.
What is the image distance and what is the image height?
Solution: \frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f} The focal length is one-half the center of curvature so it is 15.0 cm. \frac{1}{20.0}+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{15}  multiply both sides by 60x to get  3x + 60 = 4x  and x = 60.0 \ cm .
The image distance is 60.0 cm.
