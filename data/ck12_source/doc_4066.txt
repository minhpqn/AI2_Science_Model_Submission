Budding is the pinching off of an offspring from the parent cell.
The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent.
Budding in yeast is pictured in Figure below .
Yeast reproduce asexually by budding
Yeast reproduce asexually by budding.
Sexual reproduction also occurs in virtually all fungi.
This involves mating between two haploid hyphae.
During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse, forming a diploid spore called a zygospore .
The zygospore is genetically different from the parents.
After the zygospore germinates, it can undergo meiosis, forming haploid cells that develop into new hyphae.
The majority of fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually.
This allows them to adjust to conditions in the environment.
Yeast reproduce asexually by budding.
Other fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores.
Sexual reproduction occurs when spores from two parents fuse and form a zygospore.
