The generators convert kinetic energy to electrical energy.
The kinetic energy may come from flowing water, burning fuel, wind, or some other energy source.
Transmission lines on big towers—like those in the opening photo above—carry high-voltage electric current from power plants to electric substations.
Smaller towers and individual power poles carry lower-voltage current from electric substations to homes and businesses.
Electric substations have several functions.
Many substations distribute electricity from a few high-voltage lines to several lower-voltage lines.
They have electric transformers, which use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of the current.
Some transformers increase the voltage; others decrease the voltage.
In the Figure below , you can see how both types of transformers are used in an electrical grid.
Linear schematic focused on transformers.
A step-up transformer increases the voltage of the current as it leaves the power plant.
After the voltage has been increased, less current travels through the high-voltage power lines.
This reduces the amount of power that is lost due to resistance of the power lines.
A step-down transformer decreases the voltage of the current so it can be distributed safely to businesses and homes.
A high-voltage power line may have 750,000 volts, whereas most home circuits have a maximum of 240 volts.
Therefore, one or more step-down transformers are needed to decrease the voltage of current before it enters homes.
Q:
Assume that a home needs a 14-volt circuit for a light and a 120-volt circuit for a microwave oven.
If the main power line entering home has 240 volts, what can you infer about the home’s electrical system?
A:
