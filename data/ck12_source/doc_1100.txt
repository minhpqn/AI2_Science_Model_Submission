Galileo could see four moons of Jupiter.
This was four more than could be seen with the naked eye.
But we now know that there are 66 moons.
Galileo would be astonished to see all of Jupiter's moons.
And imagine what he would think of the galaxies!
Types of Telescopes
Humans have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
The term "telescope" was coined by the Italian scientist and mathematician Galileo Galilei (1564–1642).
Galileo built the first telescope in 1608.
His telescope used two lenses to make distant objects appear both nearer and larger.
He subsequently made many improvements to telescope design.
Telescopes that use lenses to bend light are called refracting telescopes , or refractors ( Figure below ).
The earliest telescopes were all refractors.
Many amateur astronomers still use refractors today.
Refractors are good for viewing details within our solar system.
Craters on the surface of Earth’s Moon or the rings around Saturn are two such details.
A large refracting telescope
Refracting telescopes can be very large.
Around 1670, Sir Isaac Newton built a different kind of telescope.
Newton's telescope used curved mirrors instead of lenses to focus light.
