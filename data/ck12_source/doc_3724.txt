Codons are complementary groups of bases in mRNA.
Steps of Transcription
Transcription takes place in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.
The steps are illustrated in Figure below .
Initiation is the beginning of transcription.
It occurs when the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a region of a gene called the promoter .
This signals the DNA to unwind so the enzyme can ‘‘read’’ the bases in one of the DNA strands.
The enzyme is now ready to make a strand of mRNA with a complementary sequence of bases.
Elongation is the addition of nucleotides to the mRNA strand.
RNA polymerase reads the unwound DNA strand and builds the mRNA molecule, using complementary base pairs.
There is a brief time during this process when the newly formed RNA is bound to the unwound DNA.
During this process, an adenine (A) in the DNA binds to an uracil (U) in the RNA.
Termination is the ending of transcription, and occurs when RNA polymerase crosses a stop (termination) sequence in the gene.
The mRNA strand is complete, and it detaches from DNA.
Steps of transcription: initiation, elongation, termination
Steps of Transcription.
Transcription occurs in the three steps - initiation, elongation, and termination - shown here.
In eukaryotes, the new mRNA is not yet ready for translation.
It must go through additional processing before it leaves the nucleus.
This may include splicing, editing, and polyadenylation.
