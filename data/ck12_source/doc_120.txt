Birds of all types, from hummingbirds to ostriches, make nests.
Many can be elaborate, shaped like cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows.
However, some birds, like the common guillemot, do not use nests.
Instead, they lay their eggs on bare cliffs.
Emperor penguins do not have a nest at all; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they hatch, a process called incubation .
How else might a bird help protect its young from predators?
Most species locate their nests in areas that are hidden, in order to avoid predators.
Large birds, or those that nest in groups, may build nests in the open, since they are more capable of defending their young.

In birds, 90% to 95% of species are monogamous , meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one mate dies.
Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are monogamous.
Usually, the parents take turns incubating the eggs.
Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid.
In polygamous species, where there is more than one mate, one parent does all of the incubating.
The wild turkey is an example of a polygamous bird.
The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different species of birds.
At one extreme, in a group of birds called the magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at hatching.
In this case, the newly-hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away.
These birds are called precocial .
