Describe translation.
Explain that translation is the process of ordering the amino acids into a polypeptide; translation involves changing the language of nucleotides into the language of amino acids.
Illustrate the process of translation, describing how mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA all work together to complete the process.
Discuss what happens to the polypeptide after translation.
RNA to proteins.
How?
You must translate.
To go from one language to another.
Spanish to English, French to German, or nucleotides to amino acids.
Which type is the translation of molecular biology?
Obviously, the type of translating discussed here translates from the language of nucleotides to the language of amino acids.
Translation is “RNA → protein.” In other words, translation is the transfer of the genetic instructions in RNA to a protein made of amino acids.
Translation uses the products of transcription, mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, to convert the mRNA sequence into a polypeptide according to the genetic code.
The mRNA moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to interact with a ribosome , which serves as the site of translation.
Translation proceeds in three phases: initiation , elongation and termination .
To understand translation, first we need to understand the ribosome.
Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, a small subunit and a larger subunit.
Prokaryotic subunits are named the 30S and 50S subunits; eukaryotic subunits are named the 40S and 60S subunits.
During translation the tRNA molecules are literally “inside” the ribosomal subunits, as they sit on the mRNA strand.
When tRNAs come to the ribosome, adjacent amino acids are brought together, allowing the ribosome to catalyze the formation of the peptide bond between amino acids.
