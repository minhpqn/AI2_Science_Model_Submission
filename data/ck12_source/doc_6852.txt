Land-living arthropods have internal surfaces that help exchange gasses.
Insects and most other terrestrial species have a tracheal system, where air sacs lead into the body from pores in the exoskeleton.
These pores cover a large part of their external body surface.
Others use book lungs, gills modified for breathing air, as seen in species like the coconut crab.
Some areas of the legs of soldier crabs are covered with an oxygen absorbing skin.
Land crabs sometimes have two different structures: one used for breathing underwater, and another used to absorb oxygen from the air.

The arthropods include four living subphyla: chelicerates, including spiders, mites, and scorpions; myriapods, including centipedes and millipedes; hexapods, including insects; and crustaceans.
Arthropods are characterized by a segmented body, a hard exoskeleton, and appendages used for feeding, sensory structures, defense, and locomotion.
