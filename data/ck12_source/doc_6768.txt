A roller coaster begins at rest 120 \;\mathrm{m} above the ground, as shown.
Assume no friction from the wheels and air, and that no energy is lost to heat, sound, and so on.
The radius of the loop is 40 \;\mathrm{m} .
Find the speed of the roller coaster at points B, C, D, E, F , and H .
Assume that 25 % of the initial potential energy of the coaster is lost due to heat, sound, and air resistance along its route.
How far short of point H will the coaster stop?
A pendulum has a string with length 1.2 m.
You hold it at an angle of 22 degrees to the vertical and release it.
The pendulum bob has a mass of 2.0 kg.
What is the potential energy of the bob before it is released? ( Hint: use geometry to determine the height when released. )
What is its speed when it passes through the midpoint of its swing?
Now the pendulum is transported to Mars, where the acceleration of gravity g is 2.3 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 .
Answer parts (a) and (b) again, but this time using the acceleration on Mars.
