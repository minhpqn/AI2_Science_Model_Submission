Find the missing legs or angles of the triangles shown.
Draw in the x- and y- velocity components for each dot along the path of the cannonball.
The first one is done for you.
Analyze and solve problems in two dimensions containing velocity vectors but no acceleration.
Students will learn how analyze and solve problems in two dimensions containing velocity vectors but no acceleration.
v_{x} = v \cos \theta , where \theta is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal.
v_{y} = v \sin \theta , where \theta is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal.
\Delta x = v_{x} t
\Delta y = v_{y} t
Guidance The only equation you need is that displacement in a certain direction equals the component of velocity in that direction multiplied by the time it takes.
You'll use this once for the x-direction and once for the y-direction and solve for what is asked.
Question:
If a river is flowing north at 2 m/s and you swim straight across (i.e. east) at 1.5 m/s, how far up shore will you be from your starting point once you reach the other side?
The river is 9 m wide.
