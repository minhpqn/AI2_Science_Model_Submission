Look for information on the dates and whether the Moon will not be lighting up the sky.
If you look at the sky on a dark night, you may see a meteor ( Figure below ).
A meteor forms a streak of light across the sky.
People call them shooting stars because that's what they look like.
But meteors are not stars at all.
The light you see comes from a small piece of matter burning up as it flies through Earth's atmosphere.
Meteors burning up as they fall through Earth's atmosphere
Meteors burning up as they fall through Earth's atmosphere.
Before these small pieces of matter enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere, they are called meteoroids .
Meteoroids are as large as boulders or as small as tiny sand grains.
Larger objects are called asteroids; smaller objects are interplanetary dust.
Meteoroids sometimes cluster together in long trails.
They are the debris left behind by comets.
When Earth passes through a comet trail, there is a meteor shower .
During a meteor shower, there are many more meteors than normal for a night or two.

A meteoroid is dragged toward Earth by gravity and enters the atmosphere.
Friction with the atmosphere heats the object quickly, so it starts to vaporize.
As it flies through the atmosphere, it leaves a trail of glowing gases.
The object is now a meteor.
