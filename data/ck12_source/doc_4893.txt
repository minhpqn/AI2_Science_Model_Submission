Intermediate filaments differ in make-up from one cell type to another.
Intermediate filaments organize the inside structure of the cell by holding organelles and providing strength.
They are also structural components of the nuclear envelope.
Intermediate filaments made of the protein keratin are found in skin, hair, and nails cells.
(a) The eukaryotic cytoskeleton.
Microfilaments are shown in red, microtubules in green, and the nuclei are in blue.
By linking regions of the cell together, the cytoskeleton helps support the shape of the cell. (b) Microscopy of microfilaments (actin filaments), shown in green, inside cells.
The nucleus is shown in blue.

actin :
A thin, threadlike protein filament found in muscle; the protein component of microfilaments.
cytoplasm :
The gel-like material inside the plasma membrane of a cell; holds the cell's organelles (excluding the nucleus).
cytoskeleton :
The structure of filaments and tubules in the cytoplasm; provides a cell with an internal framework.
cytosol :
A watery cytoplasmic fluid that contains cytoskeletal fragments, dissolved particles and organelles.
intermediate filaments :
