In the second period, the 2 s sublevel, with two electrons, and the 2 p sublevel with six electrons, are being filled.
Consequently, the second period contains eight elements.
The third period is similar to the second, filling the 3 s and 3 p sublevels.
Notice that the 3 d sublevel does not actually fill until after the 4 s sublevel.
This results in the fourth period containing 18 elements due to the additional 10 electrons that are contributed by the d sublevel.
The fifth period is similar to the fourth.
After the 6 s sublevel fills, the 4 f sublevel with its 14 electrons fills.
This is followed by the 5 d and the 6 p .
The total number of elements in the sixth period is 32.
The later elements in the seventh period are still being created.
So while there are a possible of 32 elements in the period, the current number is slightly less.
The period to which a given element belongs can easily be determined from its electron configuration.
For example, consider the element nickel (Ni).
Its electron configuration is [Ar]3 d 8 4 s 2 .  The highest occupied principal energy level is the fourth, indicated by the 4 in the 4 s 2 portion of the configuration.
Therefore, nickel can be found in the fourth period of the periodic table.
Based on electron configurations, the periodic table can be divided into blocks denoting which sublevel is in the process of being filled.
The s , p , d , and f blocks are illustrated below.

The figure also illustrates how the d sublevel is always one principal level behind the period in which that sublevel occurs.
In other words, the 3 d sublevel fills during the fourth period.
