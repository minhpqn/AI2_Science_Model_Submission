The country of Japan is an island arc that lies at the intersection of the North American, Filipino, and Eurasian plates.
Colors in this picture indicate elevation.

Subduction of a plate leads to melting and volcanism.
An island arc is a line of volcanoes on an oceanic plate.
A continental arc is a line of volcanoes on a continental plate.
