These reactions are called replacement reactions.
What Is a Replacement Reaction?
A replacement reaction occurs when elements switch places in compounds.
This type of reaction involves ions (electrically charged versions of atoms) and ionic compounds.
These are compounds in which positive ions of a metal and negative ions of a nonmetal are held together by ionic bonds.
Generally, a more reactive element replaces an element that is less reactive, and the less reactive element is set free from the compound.
There are two types of replacement reactions: single and double.
Both types are described below.
Q:
Can you predict how single and double replacement reactions differ?
A:
One way they differ is that a single replacement reaction involves one reactant compound, whereas a double replacement reaction involves two reactant compounds.

Single Replacement Reactions
A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another in a single compound.
This type of reaction has the general equation:
A + BC â†’ B + AC
In this equation, A represents a more reactive element and BC represents the original compound.
During the reaction, A replaces B, forming the product compound AC and releasing the less reactive element B.
An example of a single replacement reaction occurs when potassium (K) reacts with water (H 2 O).
