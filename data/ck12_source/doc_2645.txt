Energy and Ionic Bonds
It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom because the force of attraction between the negative electrons and the positive nucleus must be overcome.
The amount of energy needed depends on the element.
Less energy is needed to remove just one or a few valence electrons than many.
This explains why sodium and other alkali metals form positive ions so easily.
Less energy is also needed to remove electrons from larger atoms in the same group.
For example, in group 1, it takes less energy to remove an electron from francium (Fr) at the bottom of the group than from lithium (Li) at the top of the group (see the Figure above ).
In bigger atoms, valence electrons are farther from the nucleus.
As a result, the force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is weaker.
Q:
What do you think happens when an atom gains an electron and becomes a negative ion?
A:
Energy is released when an atom gains an electron.
Halogens release the most energy when they form ions.
As a result, they are very reactive elements.
An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions.
It forms when atoms of a metallic element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element.
Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals.
That’s because metals “want” to give up electrons, and nonmetals “want” to gain electrons.
It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom and form a positive ion.
