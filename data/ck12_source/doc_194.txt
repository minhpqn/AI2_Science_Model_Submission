This change can be either positive or negative.
A negative change, such as that in the example problem above, is sometimes called negative acceleration or deceleration.
Average acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, or the change in velocity per unit time.
Complete the activity found at this URL to help you understand acceleration.
The velocity of a car increases from +2.0 m/s to +16.0 m/s in a time period of 3.5 s.
What was the average acceleration?
If an automobile slows from +26 m/s to +18 m/s in a period of 4.0 s, what was the average acceleration?
If a runner increases his velocity from 0 m/s to +20 m/s in 2.0 s, what was his average acceleration?
If a runner decreases his velocity from +20 m/s to +10 m/s in 2.0 s, what was his average acceleration?
average acceleration:
The change in velocity over the change in time.
Define uniform acceleration.
Understand and use the equation relating initial velocity, acceleration, time, and final velocity.
Cliff divers undergo effective free fall
After jumping, this cliff diver undergoes effective free fall.
Cliff diving is a sport in which athletes twist and flip on their way down.
Even with the air resistance, these divers will accelerate the whole way down.
Acceleration that does not change in time is called uniform or constant acceleration.
The velocity at the beginning of the time interval is called initial velocity, v_i , and the velocity at the end of the time interval is called final velocity, v_f .  In a velocity versus time graph for uniform acceleration, the slope of the line is the acceleration.
The equation that describes the curve is v_f = v_i + at .
