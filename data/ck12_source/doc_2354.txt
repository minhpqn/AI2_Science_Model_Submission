A control is a variable that must be held constant so it won't influence the outcome of an experiment.
The control can be used as a standard for comparison between experiments.
In the case of your ramp experiment, smoothness of the ramps should have been controlled by making each ramp out of the same material.
For other examples of controls in an experiment, watch the video at the URL below.
It is Part II of the above video bouncing balls.

Q:
What other variables do you think might influence the outcome of your ramp experiment?
How could these other variables be controlled?
A:
Other variables might include variables relating to the block.
For example, a smoother block would be expected to go down a ramp faster than a rougher block.
You could control variables relating to the block by using two identical blocks.
An experiment is a controlled scientific study of specific variables.
A variable is a factor that can take on different values.
There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a manipulated variable and a responding variable.
A control is a variable that must be held constant so it wonâ€™t influence the outcome of an experiment.
Do virtual experiments with objects sliding down ramps at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.
For the y-axis, select Y pos (position of the object relative to the starting point), and for the x-axis, select time (time elapsed since the object started moving).
From the controls, select one variable other than delta T to be your manipulated variable.
