What is the function of each tissue type?
Above the meristem, the rest of the root is covered with a single layer of epidermal cells.
These cells may have root hairs that increase the surface area for the absorption of water and minerals from the soil.
Beneath the epidermis is ground tissue, which may be filled with stored starch.
Bundles of vascular tissues form the center of the root.
Waxy layers waterproof the vascular tissues so they donâ€™t leak, making them more efficient at carrying fluids.
Secondary meristem is located within and around the vascular tissues.
This is where growth in thickness occurs.
The structure of roots helps them perform their primary functions.
What do roots do?
They have three major jobs: absorbing water and minerals, anchoring and supporting the plant, and storing food.
Absorbing water and minerals:
Thin-walled epidermal cells and root hairs are well suited to absorb water and dissolved minerals from the soil.
The roots of many plants also have a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi for greater absorption.
Anchoring and supporting the plant:
Root systems help anchor plants to the ground, allowing plants to grow tall without toppling over.
A tough covering may replace the epidermis in older roots, making them ropelike and even stronger.
As shown in Figure below , some roots have unusual specializations for anchoring plants.
Storing food:
In many plants, ground tissues in roots store food produced by the leaves during photosynthesis.
