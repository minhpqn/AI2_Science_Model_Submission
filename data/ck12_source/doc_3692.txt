Some of the resulting gametes will be missing a chromosome, while others will have an extra copy of the chromosome.
If such gametes are fertilized and form zygotes, they usually do not survive.
If they do survive, the individuals are likely to have serious genetic disorders.
Table below lists several genetic disorders that are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes.
Most chromosomal disorders involve the X chromosome.
Look back at the X and Y chromosomes and you will see why.
The X and Y chromosomes are very different in size, so nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes occurs relatively often.
extra copy (complete or partial) of chromosome 21 (see Figure below )
developmental delays, distinctive facial appearance, and other abnormalities (see Figure below )
one X chromosome but no other sex chromosome (XO)
female with short height and infertility (inability to reproduce)
Triple X syndrome
three X chromosomes (XXX)
female with mild developmental delays and menstrual irregularities
one Y chromosome and two or more X chromosomes (XXY, XXXY)
male with problems in sexual development and reduced levels of the male hormone testosterone
Karyotype and Down Syndrome

A karyotype is a picture of a cell's chromosomes.
Note the extra chromosome 21. (right) Child with Down syndrome, exhibiting characteristic facial appearance.
