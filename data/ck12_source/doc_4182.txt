The bloodroot shown in Figure below stores food in its roots over the winter.
Mangrove roots are like stilts, allowing mangrove trees to rise high above the water.
The trunk and leaves are above water even at high tide.
A bloodroot plant uses food stored over the winter to grow flowers in the early spring.
Roots have primary and secondary meristems for growth in length and width.
As roots grow longer, they always grow down into the ground.
Even if you turn a plant upside down, its roots will try to grow downward.
How do roots “know” which way to grow?
How can they tell down from up?
Specialized cells in root caps are able to detect gravity.
The cells direct meristem in the tips of roots to grow downward toward the center of Earth.
This is generally adaptive for land plants.
Can you explain why?
As roots grow thicker, they can’t absorb water and minerals as well.
However, they may be even better at transporting fluids, anchoring the plant, and storing food (see Figure below ).
Sweet potato roots that store energy
Secondary growth of sweet potato roots provides more space to store food.
Roots store sugar from photosynthesis as starch.
What other starchy roots do people eat?
Roots absorb water and minerals and transport them to stems.
