Filtering Blood and Forming Urine
As shown in Figure below , each nephron acts as a tiny filtering plant.
It filters blood and forms urine in the following steps:
Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery , which branches into capillaries.
When blood passes through capillaries of the glomerulus of a nephron, blood pressure forces some of the water and dissolved substances in the blood to cross the capillary walls into Bowmanâ€™s capsule .
The filtered substances pass to the renal tubule of the nephron.
In the renal tubule, some of the filtered substances are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream.
Other substances are secreted into the fluid.
The fluid passes to a collecting duct, which reabsorbs some of the water and returns it to the bloodstream.
The fluid that remains in the collecting duct is urine.

Excretion of Urine
From the collecting ducts of the kidneys, urine enters the ureters , two muscular tubes that move the urine by peristalsis to the bladder (see Figure above ).
The bladder is a hollow, sac-like organ that stores urine.
When the bladder is about half full, it sends a nerve impulse to a sphincter to relax and let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra.
The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body.
Urine leaves the body through another sphincter in the process of urination .
This sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control.
