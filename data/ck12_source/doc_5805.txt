Distinguish flagellates from ciliates.
What can hunt prey and move, but is not an animal?
Some protists, like these Paramecium , act much like animals.
Notice the tiny hair-like cilia that help them move.
The food vacuoles, where they digest their prey, are colored in orange.
Animal-like protists are called protozoa.
Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotes that share some traits with animals.
Like animals, they can move, and they are heterotrophs .
That means they eat things outside of themselves instead of producing their own food.
Animal-like protists are very small, measuring only about 0.01â€“0.5mm.
Animal-like protists include the flagellates, ciliates, and the sporozoans.
Different Kinds of Animal-like Protists
There are many different types of animal-like protists.
They are different because they move in different ways.
Flagellates have long flagella, or tails.
Flagella rotate in a propeller-like fashion, pushing the protist through its environment ( Figure below ).
An example of a flagellate is Trypanosoma , which causes African sleeping sickness.
Other protists have what are called transient pseudopodia , which are like temporary feet.
The cell surface extends out to form feet-like structures that propel the cell forward.
An example of a protist with pseudopodia is the amoeba.
