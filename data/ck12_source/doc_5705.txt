At the heart of quantum mechanics is the idea that we cannot specify accurately the location of an electron.
All we can say is that there is a probability that it exists within this certain volume of space.
The scientist Erwin Schrödinger developed an equation that deals with these calculations, which we will not pursue at this time.

Quantum mechanics involves the study of material at the atomic level.
This field deals with probabilities since we cannot definitely locate a particle.
