Electric cars are becoming more popular.
One large advantage for electric cars is the low cost of operation, which may become an ever bigger advantage as gas prices climb.
Energy costs for electric cars average about one-third of the cost for gasoline engine cars, but they can only travel about 200 miles per charge at this point.
These cars run using the science of electrical charges and forces.
The questions regarding the relationship between the electrical force, the size of the charge, and the separation between the charges were solved by Charles Coulomb in 1785.
He determined that electrical force between two charges is directly related to the size of the charges and inversely proportional to the distance between the charges.
This is known as Coulomb’s Law.
In this equation, q 1 and q 2 are the two charges, d  is the distance between the two charges, and K  is a constant of proportionality.
F e is the electric force , which occurs as a result of interactions between two charged particles.
For the purpose of calculating electric forces, we assume all charge is a point charge , in which the entire charge of the particle is located in a massless point.
The SI unit of charge is the coulomb, C , which is the charge of 6.25 \times 10^{18} electrons.
The charge on a single electron is 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \ C .
The charge on a single electron is known as the elementary charge .
The charge on a proton is the same magnitude but opposite in sign.
When the charges are measured in coulombs, the distance in meters, and the force in Newtons, the constant K  is 9.0 \times 10^9 \ N \cdot m^2/C^2 .
