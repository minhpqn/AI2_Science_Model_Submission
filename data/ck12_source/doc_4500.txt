Nails and Hair
Summarize the structure and functions of the hair and nails.
Would you believe this is a close-up of your hair and scalp?
Well maybe not yours.
But some other person's.
Hair is an integral part of the integumentary system.
And although many people may lose some or all of the hair on top of their head, they still have hair on their arms and legs that perform important functions.
Nails and Hair
In addition to the skin, the integumentary system includes the nails and hair.
Like the skin, these organs help the body maintain homeostasis.
Fingernails and toenails consist of specialized epidermal cells that are filled with keratin .
The keratin makes them tough and hard, which is important for the functions they serve.
Fingernails prevent injury by forming protective plates over the ends of the fingers.
They also enhance sensation by acting as a counterforce to the sensitive fingertips when objects are handled.
Nails are similar to claws in other animals.
They cover the tips of fingers and toes.
Fingernails and toenails both grow from nail beds.
As the nail grows, more cells are added at the nail bed.
Older cells get pushed away from the nail bed and the nail grows longer.
There are no nerve endings in the nail.
