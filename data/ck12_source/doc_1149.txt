The Phases of the Moon
The Moon does not produce any light of its own.
It only reflects light from the Sun.
The Moon has phases because it orbits around Earth.
One orbit takes about 28 days.
As the moon moves around Earth, different parts of it appear to be lit up by the Sun.
The Moon sometimes appears fully lit and sometimes completely dark.
Sometimes it is partially lit.
The different appearances of the Moon are referred to as phases of the Moon ( Figure below ).
A full moon occurs when the whole side facing Earth is lit.
This happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun.
