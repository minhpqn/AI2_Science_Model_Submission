In the Figure above , these are the elements with a yellow background.
The force of repulsion among all those protons makes the nuclei unstable.
Elements with more than 92 protons have such unstable nuclei that they donâ€™t even exist in nature.
They have only been created in labs.
Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive.
These isotopes are called radioisotopes.
An example of a radioisotope is carbon-14.
The nuclei of radioisotopes are unstable, so they constantly decay and emit radiation.
In elements with more than 83 protons, all of the isotopes are radioactive.
Watch the video about radioisotopes at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.
