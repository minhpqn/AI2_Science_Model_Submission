Electrons are arranged into distinct energy levels, at various distances from the nucleus.
An atom is electrically neutral if it has the same number of protons as electrons.
Each element has atoms with a characteristic number of protons, which defines the atomic number of the element.
For example, all carbon atoms have six protons, and all oxygen atoms have eight protons.
A combination of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus gives the approximate atomic mass of the atom, measured in an amu, or atomic mass unit.
For example, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and an atomic mass of 1.00794 amu; carbon has an atomic number of 6 and an atomic mass of 12.0107 amu; oxygen has an atomic number of 8 and an atomic mass of 15.9994 amu.

Model of an Atom.
The protons and neutrons of this atom make up its nucleus.
Electrons surround the nucleus.
The majority of known elements are classified as metals.
Metals are elements that are lustrous, or shiny.
They are also good conductors of electricity and heat.
Examples of metals include iron, gold, and copper.
Fewer than 20 elements are classified as nonmetals.
Nonmetals lack the properties of metals.
Examples of nonmetals include oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur.
Certain other elements have properties of both metals and nonmetals.
