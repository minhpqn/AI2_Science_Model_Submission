Q:
How has the microscope advanced scientific knowledge?
A:
The microscope has revealed secrets of the natural world like no other single invention.
The microscope let scientists see entire new worlds, leading to many discoveries—especially in biology and medicine—that could not have been made without it.
Some examples include the discovery of cells and the identification of bacteria and other single-celled organisms.
With the development of more powerful microscopes, viruses were discovered and even atoms finally became visible.
These discoveries changed our ideas about the human body and the nature of life itself.
Like microscopes, telescopes use convex lenses to make enlarged images.
However, telescopes make enlarged images of objects—such as distant stars—that only appear tiny because they are very far away.
There are two basic types of telescopes: reflecting telescopes and refracting telescopes.
The two types are compared in the Figure below .
They differ in how they collect light, but both use convex lenses to form enlarged images.

Schematic of a telescope
A camera is an optical instrument that forms and records an image of an object.
The image may be recorded on film or it may be detected by an electronic sensor that stores the image digitally.
Regardless of how the image is recorded, all cameras form images in the same basic way, as shown in the Figure below .
Light passes through the lens at the front of the camera and enters the camera through an opening called the aperture.
