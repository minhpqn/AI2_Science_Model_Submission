What is competition?
Describe the evolutionary effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition.
Compare and contrast mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.
Do interactions between species always result in harm?
A commensal shrimp sits on another sea organism, a sea slug.
As a commensal shrimp, it neither brings a benefit nor has a negative effect on its host.
Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits.
For the other species, the relationship may be positive, negative, or neutral.
There are three basic types of symbiosis: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.
Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit.
An example of mutualism involves goby fish and shrimp (see Figure below ).
The nearly blind shrimp and the fish spend most of their time together.
The shrimp maintains a burrow in the sand in which both the fish and shrimp live.
When a predator comes near, the fish touches the shrimp with its tail as a warning.
Then, both fish and shrimp retreat to the burrow until the predator is gone.
From their relationship, the shrimp gets a warning of approaching danger.
The fish gets a safe retreat and a place to lay its eggs.
