If it does, the potential energy changes back to kinetic energy.
That’s what happened to Sari.
After she and Daniel left the theater, the storm cleared and they went for a swim.
That’s Sari in the Figure below coming down the water slide.
When she was at the top of the slide, she had potential energy.
Why?
She had the potential to slide into the water because of the pull of gravity.
As she moved down the slide, her potential energy changed to kinetic energy.
By the time she reached the water, all the potential energy had changed to kinetic energy.
Water slides convert gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy
Q:
How could Sari regain her potential energy?
A:
Sari could climb up the steps to the top of the slide.
It takes kinetic energy to climb the steps, and this energy would be stored in Sari as she climbed.
By the time she got to the top of the slide, she would have the same amount of potential energy as before.
A roller coaster is another fun example of changes between kinetic and potential energy.
Watch the roller coaster animation at the URL below to see the energy changes.
Notice how the roller coaster’s total energy (kinetic energy + potential energy) does not change.
