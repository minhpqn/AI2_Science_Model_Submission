What do think this picture shows?
Here’s a hint:
This illustration mimics a photo taken with a special microscope that makes images of things that are extremely small.
In fact, the gray spheres in the image represent things so small that trillions of them would fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Each gray sphere is an atom of lead.
Do you know what atoms are?
They are the basic building blocks of matter.
Matter, in turn, is all the “stuff” in the universe.
In this unit you will learn much more about matter—from things as simple as atoms to as complex as you!
Matter, Mass, and Volume
State what mass measures.
State what volume measures.
Can you guess what this colorful image shows?
Believe it or not, it actually depicts individual atoms of cesium (reddish-orange) on a surface of gallium arsenide molecules (blue).
The image was created with an extremely powerful microscope, called a scanning tunneling microscope.
This is the only type of microscope that can make images of things as small as atoms, the basic building blocks of matter.
What’s the Matter?
Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe.
Everything you can see and touch is made of matter, including you!
The only things that aren’t matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound.
