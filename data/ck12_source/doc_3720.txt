What are Chargaff’s rules?
Identify the structure of the DNA molecule.
What are nucleotides?
What makes up a nucleotide?
Why is DNA replication said to be semi-conservative?
Create a diagram that shows how DNA replication occurs.
What is complementary base pairing?
Explain why complementary base pairing is necessary to maintain the double helix shape of the DNA molecule.
Compare RNA to DNA.
Describe the functions of the three main types of RNA.
How does the information move from the nucleus, where the DNA is located, to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are?
RNA, the other nucleic acid, that's how.
Specifically mRNA.
RNA, the middle player in the central dogma.
This image is an abstract representation of tRNA.
Without tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA, proteins cannot be made.
DNA alone cannot ‘‘tell’’ your cells how to make proteins.
It needs the help of RNA , ribonucleic acid, the other main player in the central dogma of molecular biology.
