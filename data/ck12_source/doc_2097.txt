If there are no accidents, a nuclear power plant releases nothing but steam into the air.
But nuclear energy does create other environmental problems.
Splitting atoms creates dangerous radioactive waste.
These wastes can remain dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years.
Scientists and engineers are still looking for ways to keep this waste safely away from people.
KQED:
