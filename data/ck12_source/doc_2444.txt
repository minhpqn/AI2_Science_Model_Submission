Look at the quartz rock and plastic bag pictured in the Figure below .
Which type of solid do you think each of them is?
Quartz rock and a plastic bag
A:
The quartz is a crystalline solid.
Rocks are made of minerals and minerals form crystals.
You can see their geometric shapes.
The bag is an amorphous solid.
It is made of the plastic and most plastics do not form crystals.
A solid is a state of matter in which particles of matter are tightly packed together.
This holds the particles rigidly in place and gives solids a fixed shape and fixed volume.
Crystalline solids have particles that are arranged in a regular repeating pattern.
They form crystals.
Amorphous solids have particles that are arranged more-or-less at random.
They do not form crystals.
At the following URL, read the article about solids.
Then answer the questions below.
According to the article, what is the only way the shape of a solid can be changed?
Give an example.
Describe the analogy in the article in which crystalline and amorphous solids are compared to a classroom.
