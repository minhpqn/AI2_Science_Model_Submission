How is ATP made during the third stage of cellular respiration?
Connecting Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis
Name the products and reactants of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
Explain how cellular respiration and photosynthesis are connected.
How do trees help you breathe?
Recall that trees release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis.
And you need oxygen to breathe.
Do you know why?
So your cells can perform cellular respiration and make ATP.
Connecting Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are connected through an important relationship.
This relationship enables life to survive as we know it.
The products of one process are the reactants of the other.
Notice that the equation for cellular respiration is the direct opposite of photosynthesis :
Cellular Respiration:
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O
Photosynthesis: 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2
Photosynthesis makes the glucose that is used in cellular respiration to make ATP.
The glucose is then turned back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis.
While water is broken down to form oxygen during photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen to form water.
