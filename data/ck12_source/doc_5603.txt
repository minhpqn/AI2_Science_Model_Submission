How many meters are in 3.7 km?
How many kg in 12980 g?
conversion factor:
A ratio of equivalent measurements.
dimensional analysis:
A technique that uses the units (dimensions) of the measurement in order to correctly solve problems.
Metric Unit Conversions
Use dimensional analysis to carry out metric unit conversions.
Runners on a track
How can a number of track laps be converted to a distance in meters?
You are training for a 10-kilometer run by doing laps on a 400-meter track.
You ask yourself “How many times do I need to run around this track in order to cover ten kilometers?” (more than you realize).
By using dimensional analysis, you can easily determine the number of laps needed to cover the 10 k distance.
Metric Unit Conversions
The metric system’s many prefixes allow quantities to be expressed in many different units.
Dimensional analysis is useful to convert from one metric system unit to another.
Sample Problem:
Metric Unit Conversions
A particular experiment requires 120 mL of a solution.
The teacher knows that he will need to make enough solution for 40 experiments to be performed throughout the day.
