Dinosaur fossils are significant evidence of evolution and of past life on Earth.
Evolution of Life
The diversity of life on Earth today is the result of evolution.
Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since.
At first, all living things on Earth were simple, single-celled organisms.
Much later, the first multicellular organisms evolved, and after that, Earth’s biodiversity greatly increased.
Figure below shows a timeline of the history of life on Earth.
