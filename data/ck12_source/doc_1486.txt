These winds blow in the same direction all the time.
So they can keep water moving in the same direction.
Surface currents are created by three things:
global wind patterns
the rotation of the Earth
the shape of the ocean basins
Surface currents are extremely important because they distribute heat around the planet.
Surface currents also have a tremendous influence on climate around the globe.
Global Wind Patterns
Winds on Earth are either global or local.
Global winds blow in the same directions all the time.
They are created when more solar energy strikes the Equator than the polar regions.
More about global wind patterns is described in detail in the concept "Global Wind Belts."
The major wind belts push the water in the surface currents.
The water moves in the direction of :
trade winds: east to west between the Equator and 30°N and 30°S.
westerlies: west to east in the middle latitudes.
polar easterlies: east to west between 50° and 60° north and south of the Equator and the North and South Poles.
The rotation of the Earth—that is, the Coriolis effect —causes the ocean currents to turn.
More information about the phenomenon can be found in the concept "Coriolis Effect."
