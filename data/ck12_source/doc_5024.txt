Usually, only the outermost bond breaks to release or spend energy for cellular work.
An ATP molecule, shown in the Figure below , is like a rechargeable battery: its energy can be used by the cell when it breaks apart into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate, and then the “worn-out battery” ADP can be recharged using new energy to attach a new phosphate and rebuild ATP.
The materials are recyclable, but recall that energy is not!
ADP can be further reduced to AMP (adenosine monophosphate and phosphate, releasing additional energy.
As with ADT "recharged" to ATP, AMP can be recharged to ADP.
How much energy does it cost to do your body’s work?
A single cell uses about 10 million ATP molecules per second, and recycles all of its ATP molecules about every 20-30 seconds.
An arrow shows the bond between two phosphate groups in an ATP molecule.
When this bond breaks, its chemical energy can do cellular work.
The resulting ADP molecule is recycled when new energy attaches another phosphate, rebuilding ATP.
Keep these energy-carrying molecules in mind as we look more carefully at the process which originally captures the energy to build them: photosynthesis.
Recall that it provides nearly all of the food (energy and materials) for life.
Actually, as you will see, we are indebted to photosynthesis for even more than just the energy and building blocks for life.
A explanation of ATP as biological energy is found in ATP:
Adenosine Triphosphate at  (13:35).

ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ):
Energy-carrying molecule that cells use to power their metabolic processes; energy-currency of the cell.
cellular respiration :
Metabolic process which transfers chemical energy from glucose (a deliverable fuel molecule) to ATP (a usable energy-rich molecule); respiration is most efficient in the presence of oxygen (aerobic).
