What the World Will Look Like in 2050 at According to the U.S Census Bureau, in 2050, there will be 9.4 billion people:
India will be the most populous nation, surpassing China sometime around 2025.
The U.S. will remain the third most populous nation, with a population of 423 million (up from 308 million in 2010).
Declining birth rates in Japan and Russia will cause them to fall from their current positions as the 9th and 10th most populous nations, respectively, to 16th and 17th.
Nigeria will have a population of 402 million, up from 166 million people.
Ethiopia's population will likely triple, from 91 million to 278 million, making the East African nation one of the top 10 most populous countries in the world.
So what does all this mean?
The African continent is expected to experience significant population growth in the coming decades, which could compound existing food supply problems in some African nations.
Immigration and differing birth rates among races will change the ethnic composition of the U.S.
Population booms in Africa and India, the decline of Russia, and the expected plateau of China will all change the makeup of the estimated 9.4 billion people who will call Earth home in 2050.
Other countries have completed similar demographic transitions.
However, some countries seem stalled at early stages.
They have high birth rates and rapidly growing populations.
The total human population may have to stop growing eventually.
Even if we reduce our use of resources and distribute them more fairly, at some point the carrying capacity will be reached.
