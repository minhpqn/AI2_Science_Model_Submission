The concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is maintained mainly by the balance between these two processes.

Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time.
Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection.
In natural selection, some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do.
Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things.
Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth.
As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment.
This is because they evolve adaptations.
An adaptation is a characteristic that helps a living thing survive and reproduce in a given environment.
Look at the mole in Figure below .
It has tentacles around its nose that it uses to sense things by touch.
The mole lives underground in the soil, where it is always dark.
However, by using its touch organ, it can detect even tiny food items in the soil in total darkness.
The touch organ is an adaptation because it helps the mole survive in its dark, underground environment.
A mole's nose and claws are adaptations
This mole uses its star-shaped nose organ to sense food by touch in the dark.
The moleâ€™s very large front claws are also an adaptation for its life in the soil.
Can you explain why?
The cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells, and living cells always come from other living cells.
