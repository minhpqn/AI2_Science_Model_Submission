The stretchy walls allow the bladder to hold a large amount of urine.
The bladder can hold about 1½ to 2½ cups of urine but may also hold more if the urine cannot be released immediately.
How do you know when you have to urinate?
Urination is the process of releasing urine from the body.
Urine leaves the body through the urethra.
Nerves in the bladder tell you when it is time to urinate.
As the bladder first fills with urine, you may notice a feeling that you need to urinate.
The urge to urinate becomes stronger as the bladder continues to fill up.
Brain Control of Urination
The filtering action of the kidneys is controlled by the pituitary gland .
The pituitary gland is about the size of a pea and is found below the brain ( Figure below ).
The pituitary gland releases hormones that help the kidneys to filter water from the blood.
The movement of water back into blood is controlled by a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
ADH is one of the hormones released from the pituitary gland in the brain.
One of the most important roles of ADH is to control the body’s ability to hold onto water.
If a person does not drink enough water, ADH is released.
It causes the blood to reabsorb water from the kidneys.
If the kidneys remove less water from the blood, what will the urine look like?
It will look darker, because there is less water in it.
When a person drinks a lot of water, then there will be a lot of water in the blood.
