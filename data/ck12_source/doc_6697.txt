Suppose that after 2 \;\mathrm{s} , an object has traveled 2 \;\mathrm{m} in the horizontal direction.
If the object is in projectile motion, it must travel 2 \;\mathrm{m} in the vertical direction as well.
Suppose a hunter fires his gun.
Suppose as well that as the bullet flies out horizontally and undergoes projectile motion, the shell for the bullet falls directly downward.
Then, the shell hits the ground before the bullet.
