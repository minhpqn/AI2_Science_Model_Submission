A graph of pressure vs. temperature also illustrates a direct relationship.
As a gas is cooled at constant volume its pressure continually decreases until the gas condenses to a liquid.
Sample Problem:
Gay-Lussac’s Law
The gas in an aerosol can is under a pressure of 3.00 atm at a temperature of 25°C.
It is dangerous to dispose of an aerosol can by incineration.
What would the pressure in the aerosol can be at a temperature of 845°C?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
P_1=3.00 \ \text{atm}
T_1=25^\circ \text{C}=298 \text{ K}
T_2=845^\circ \text{C}=1118 \text{ K}
P_2=? \ \text{atm}
Use Gay-Lussac’s law to solve for the unknown pressure (P_2) .
The temperatures have first been converted to Kelvin.
Step 2:
Solve.
First, rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for V_2 .
P_2=\frac{P_1 \times T_2}{T_1}
Now substitute the known quantities into the equation and solve.
