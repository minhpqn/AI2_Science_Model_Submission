Other common disaccharides include lactose ("milk sugar") and maltose.
Monosaccharides and disaccharides are also called simple sugars .
They provide the major source of energy to living cells.
Sucrose Molecule.
This sucrose molecule is a disaccharide.
It is made up of two monosaccharides: glucose on the left and fructose on the right.
Sucrose forms through a condensation reaction: glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) + fructose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) sucrose (C 12 H 22 O 11 ).
An oligosaccharide is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of monosaccharides.
Oligosaccharides can have many functions; for example, they are commonly found on the plasma membrane of animal cells where they can play a role in cell–cell recognition.
In general, they are found attached to compatible amino acid side-chains in proteins or to lipids.
Oligosaccharides are often found as a component of glycoproteins or glycolipids.
They are often used as chemical markers on the outside of cells, often for cell recognition.
An example is ABO blood type specificity.
A and B blood types have two different oligosaccharide glycolipids embedded in the cell membranes of the red blood cells, AB-type blood has both, while O blood type has neither.
Polysaccharides are long carbohydrate molecules of repeated monomer units joined together by glycosidic bonds.
A polysaccharide may contain anywhere from a few monosaccharides to several thousand monosaccharides.
Polysaccharides are also called complex carbohydrates .
Polysaccharides have a general formula of C x (H2O) y , where x is usually a large number between 200 and 2500.
Considering that the repeating units in the polymer backbone are often six-carbon monosaccharides, the general formula can also be represented as (C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n , where 40≤n≤3000.
Starches are one of the more common polysaccharides.
