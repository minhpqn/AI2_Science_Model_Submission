When the curve levels out and the concentrations all become constant, equilibrium has been reached.
At equilibrium, concentrations of all substances are constant.
In reaction B, the process begins with only HI and no H 2 or I 2 .
In this case, the concentration of HI gradually decreases while the concentrations of H 2 and I 2 gradually increase until equilibrium is again reached.
Notice that in both cases, the relative position of equilibrium is the same, as shown by the relative concentrations of reactants and products.
The concentration of HI at equilibrium is significantly higher than the concentrations of H 2 and I 2 .
This is true whether the reaction began with all reactants or all products.
The position of equilibrium is a property of the particular reversible reaction and does not depend upon how equilibrium was achieved.
A reaction goes to equilibrium regardless of the concentration of the reactants
Equilibrium between reactants and products.
Conditions for Equilibrium and Types of Equilibrium
It may be tempting to think that once equilibrium has been reached, the reaction stops.
Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process.
The forward and reverse reactions continue to occur even after equilibrium has been reached.
However, because the rates of the reactions are the same, there is no change in the relative concentrations of reactants and products for a reaction that is at equilibrium.
The conditions and properties of a system at equilibrium are summarized below.
The system must be closed, meaning no substances can enter or leave the system.
Equilibrium is a dynamic process.
Even though we donâ€™t necessarily see the reactions, both forward and reverse are taking place.
The rates of the forward and reverse reactions must be equal.
