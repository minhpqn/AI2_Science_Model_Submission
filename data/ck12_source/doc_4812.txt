You may have heard that "it's in your DNA." What does that mean?
Nucleic acids.
Essentially the "instructions" or "blueprints" of life.
Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the unique blueprints to make the proteins that give you your traits.
Half of these blueprints come from your mother, and half from your father.
And they come in different combinations every time.
In fact, every couple - every man and woman that has every lived - together has over 64,000,000,000,000 combinations of their chromosomes, which is where the DNA is found.
