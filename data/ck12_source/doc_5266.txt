If you have a cleft chin, a pointed frontal hairline (called a widow’s peak), or a hitchhiker’s thumb, you have inherited the dominant allele for each characteristic from at least one of your parents.
Other dominant traits include the presence of hair on the middle section of your fingers, thick lips, and almond-shaped eyes.
A widow's peak and hitchhiker’s thumb are displayed in Figure below , and earlobes are shown in Figure below .
Widow's peak and hitchhiker's thumb are dominant traits controlled by a single autosomal gene.
Having free-hanging earlobes is an autosomal dominant trait.
This figure shows the trait and how it was inherited in a family over three generations.
Shading indicates people who have the recessive form of the trait.
Look at (or feel) your own earlobes.
Which form of the trait do you have?
Can you tell which genotype you have?
autosome :
Any chromosome other than a sex chromosome; chromosomes 1-22 in humans; unrelated to sex determination.
genetic disorder :
A phenotype due to a mutation in a gene or chromosome; a genetic disease.
karyotype :
Depicts, usually in a photograph, the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any large chromosomal abnormalities; usually taken during metaphase of mitosis.
sex chromosome :
A chromosome that determines the sex of an organism; in humans, the X and Y chromosomes.
sex-linked trait :
A trait whose allele is found on a sex chromosome.
