That’s because we are harming the environment.
Some of the harmful effects of a high human population are:
Supplying all those people with energy creates a lot of pollution.
For example, huge oil spills have killed millions of living things.
Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air.
This also causes global warming.
Fossil fuels and other resources are being used up.
We may run out of oil by the mid-2000s.
Many other resources will run out sooner or later.
People are killing too many animals for food.
For example, some of the best fishing grounds in the oceans have almost no fish left.
People have destroyed many habitats.
For example, they’ve drained millions of acres of wetlands.
Wetlands have a great diversity of species.
As wetlands shrink, species go extinct.
People have introduced invasive species - species originally from a different area—to invade new habitats.
The introduction can be intentional or accidental.
Often, the aliens have no natural enemies in their new home.
They may drive native species extinct.
In the mid-1900s, Australian tree snakes invaded Guam and other islands in the Pacific.
