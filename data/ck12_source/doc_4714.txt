In taking measurements, what is the difference between accuracy and precision?
Why is it a good idea to try to reduce the chances of errors happening in an experiment?
To ensure that their results are not due to chance, scientists will usually carry out an experiment a number of times, a process called replication.
Devise a practical experimental approach, incorporating replication of the experiment.
