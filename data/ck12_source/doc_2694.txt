There is one carbon atom on both sides of the arrow.
There are also four hydrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms on both sides of the arrow.
Following the Law
Why must chemical equations be balanced?
It’s the law!
Matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions.
This is the law of conservation of mass .
In every chemical reaction, the same mass of matter must end up in the products as started in the reactants.
Balanced chemical equations show that mass is conserved in chemical reactions.
Lavoisier and Conservation of Mass
How do scientists know that mass is always conserved in chemical reactions?
Careful experiments in the 1700s by a French chemist named Antoine Lavoisier led to this conclusion.
Lavoisier carefully measured the mass of reactants and products in many different chemical reactions.
He carried out the reactions inside a sealed jar, like the one in the Figure below .
In every case, the total mass of the jar and its contents was the same after the reaction as it was before the reaction took place.
This showed that matter was neither created nor destroyed in the reactions.
Another outcome of Lavoisier’s research was the discovery of oxygen.
