It overlaps with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.
Land plants and animals are found on the lithosphere, freshwater and marine plants and animals are found in the hydrosphere, and birds and other flying animals are found in the atmosphere.
Of course, there are countless bacteria, protists, and fungi that are also found in the biosphere.
Is the Biosphere Living?
The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism.
The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis .
For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life.
When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly.
As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.
For a better understanding of how the biosphere works and various dysfunctions related to human activity, scientists have simulated the biosphere in small-scale models.
Biosphere 2 ( Figure below ) is a laboratory in Arizona that contains 3.15 acres of closed ecosystems.
Ecosystems of Biosphere 2 are an ocean ecosystem with a coral reef, mangrove wetlands, a tropical rainforest, a savannah grassland and a fog desert.
See  for additional information.
Additional biosphere projects include BIOS-3, a closed ecosystem in Siberia, and Biosphere J, located in Japan.
Biosphere 2 is a laboratory that contains acres of various ecosystems
Biosphere 2, in Arizona, contains 3.15 acres of closed ecosystem and is a small-scale model of the biosphere.
The biosphere is the part of the Earth, including the air, land, surface rocks, and water, where you can find life.
