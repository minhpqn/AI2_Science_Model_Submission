The continents are still moving apart.
The Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing.
The Appalachians ( Figure below ) are now on a passive margin.
The mighty mountains have weathered and eroded to what they are today.

These mountains began when North America and Eurasia collided as Pangaea came together.
The Supercontinent Cycle
Back before Pangaea, there were earlier supercontinents.
Rodinia existed 750 million to 1.1 billion years ago.
Columbia existed 1.5 to 1.8 billion years ago.
If the continents continue in their current directions, they will come together to create a supercontinent on the other side of the planet in around 200 million years.
This is known as the supercontinent cycle .
The continents smash together on opposite side of the planet around every 500 million years.
The creation of supercontinents is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see.
It is responsible for many features that are long gone.
This animation shows the movement of continents over the past 600 million years, beginning with the breakup of Rodinia:
Pangaea came together as a set of continent-continent convergent plate boundaries.
Pangaea is still breaking up as the continents move apart.
The Atlantic Ocean is getting bigger, and the Pacific Ocean is getting smaller.
