The sequence of these four bases in DNA is a code that carries instructions for making proteins.
Shown is a representation of how the double helix folds into a chromosome.
In this double-stranded nucleic acid, complementary bases (A and T, C and G) form hydrogen bonds that hold the two nucleotide chains together in the shape of a double helix.
Notice that A always bonds with T and C always bonds with G.
The hydrogen bonds help maintain the double helix shape of the molecule.
Simple Model of DNA.
In this simple model of DNA, each line represents a nucleotide chain.
The double helix shape forms when the two chains wrap around the same axis.
A brief overview of DNA, stressing the base-pairing rules, can be seen in the following animation:

Role of Nucleic Acids
The order of bases in nucleic acids is highly significant.
The bases are like the letters of a four-letter alphabet.
These "letters" can be combined to form "words." Groups of three bases form words of the genetic code .
Each code word, called a codon, stands for a different amino acid.
A series of many codons spells out the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide or protein ( Figure below ).
In short, nucleic acids contain the information needed for cells to make proteins.
This information is passed from a body cell to its daughter cells when the cell divides.
It is also passed from parents to their offspring when organisms reproduce.
