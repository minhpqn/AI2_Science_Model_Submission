\text{molar solubility} \qquad \frac{0.533 \ \cancel{\text{g}}}{\text{L}} \times \frac{1 \ \text{mol}}{245.20 \ \cancel{\text{g}}}=2.17 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{M}
The dissociation equation shows that for every mole of PbF 2 that dissociates, 1 mol of Pb 2+ and 2 mol of F âˆ’ are produced.
Therefore, at equilibrium the concentrations of the ions are:
[\text{Pb}^{2+}]=2.17 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{M} \quad \text{and} \quad [\text{F}^-]=2 \times 2.17 \times 10^{-3}=4.35 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{M}
Substitute into the expression and solve for the K_{sp} .
K_{sp}=(2.17 \times 10^{-3})(4.35 \times 10^{-3})^2=4.11 \times 10^{-8}
Step 3:
Think about your result .
