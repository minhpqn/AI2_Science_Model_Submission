Different types of minerals break apart in their own way.
Remember that all minerals are crystals.
This means that the atoms in a mineral are arranged in a repeating pattern.
This pattern determines how a mineral will break.
When you break a mineral, you break chemical bonds.
Because of the way the atoms are arranged, some bonds are weaker than other bonds.
A mineral is more likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker.
Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes.
When a mineral breaks along a plane, it makes a smooth surface.
Minerals with different crystal structures will break or cleave in different ways ( Figure below ).
Halite tends to form cubes with smooth surfaces.
Mica tends to form sheets.
Fluorite can form octahedrons.
Minerals with different crystal structures have a tendency to break along certain planes. (A) Halite breaks into cubes. (B) Muscovite breaks into sheets. (C) Fluorite breaks into octagons.
Minerals can form various shapes.
Polygons are pictured below ( Figure below ).
The shapes form as the minerals are broken along their cleavage planes.
Cleavage planes determine how the crystals can be cut to make smooth surfaces.
People who cut gemstones follow cleavage planes.
Diamonds and emeralds can be cut to make beautiful gemstones.
