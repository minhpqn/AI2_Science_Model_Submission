The heats of combustion for carbon, hydrogen, and acetylene are shown below along with each balanced equation.
\text{C}(s, \ \text{graphite})+\text{O}_2(g)\rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) \qquad \qquad \quad \triangle \text{H}=-393.5\ \text{kJ}
\text{H}_2(g)+\frac{1}{2}\text{O}_2(g)\rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \triangle \text{H}=-285.8\ \text{kJ}
\text{C}_2\text{H}_2(g)+\frac{5}{2}\text{O}_2(g)\rightarrow 2\text{CO}_2(g) +\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\qquad \triangle \text{H}=-1301.1\ \text{kJ}
To use Hess’s law, we need to determine how the three equations above can be manipulated so that they can be added together to result in the desired equation (the formation of acetylene from carbon and hydrogen).
In order to do this, we will go through the desired equation, one substance at a time – choosing the combustion reaction from the equations numbered 1-3 above that contains that substance.
It may be necessary to either reverse a combustion reaction or multiply it by some factor in order to make it “fit” to the desired equation.
The first reactant is carbon and the in the equation for the desired reaction, the coefficient of the carbon is a 2.
So, we will write the first combustion reaction, doubling all of the coefficients and the \triangle \text{H} .
2\text{C}(s, \ \text{graphite})+2\text{O}_2(g)\rightarrow 2\text{CO}_2(g) \qquad \triangle \text{H}=2(-393.5)=-787.0\ \text{kJ}
The second reactant is hydrogen and its coefficient is a 1, as it is in the second combustion reaction.
Therefore, that reaction will be used as written.
\text{H}_2(g)+\frac{1}{2}\text{O}_2(g)\rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \qquad \triangle \text{H}=-285.8\ \text{kJ}
The product of the reaction is C 2 H 2 and its coefficient is also a In combustion reaction #3, the acetylene is a reactant.
Therefore, we will reverse reaction 3, changing the sign of the \triangle \text{H} .
2\text{CO}_2(g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2(g)+\frac{5}{2}\text{O}_2(g)\qquad \triangle \text{H}=1301.1\ \text{kJ}
Now, these three reactions can be summed together.
Any substance that appears in equal quantities as a reactant in one equation and a product in another equation cancels out algebraically.
The values for the enthalpy changes are likewise added.
2\text{C}(s, \ \text{graphite})+\cancel{2\text{O}_2(g)} &\rightarrow \cancel{2\text{CO}_2(g)} &&\triangle \text{H}=-787.0\ \text{kJ}\\\text{H}_2(g)+\cancel{\frac{1}{2}\text{O}_2(g)} &\rightarrow \cancel{\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)} &&\triangle \text{H}=-285.8\ \text{kJ}\\\cancel{2\text{CO}_2(g)}+\cancel{\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)} &\rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2(g) +\cancel{\frac{5}{2}\text{O}_2(g)} &&\triangle \text{H}=1301.1\ \text{kJ}\\\hline2\text{C}(s, \ \text{graphite})+\text{H}_2(g) &\rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2(g)\qquad \qquad && \triangle \text{H}=228.3\ \text{kJ}
