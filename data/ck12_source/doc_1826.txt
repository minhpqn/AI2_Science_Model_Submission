New ways of farming were developed to protect the soil.
Some of the methods are described below ( Figure below ).

Other Ways to Reduce Soil Erosion
There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss.
Some of them are pictured below ( Figure below ).
Prevent overgrazing.
Frequently move animals from field to field.
This gives the grass a chance to recover.
Avoid logging steep hillsides.
Cut only a few trees in any given place.
Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down.
Reclaim mine lands.
Save the stripped topsoil and return it to the land.
Once the soil is in place, plant trees and other plants to protect the bare soil.
Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at construction sites.
Plant grass to hold the soil in place.
Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff.
Restrict the use of off-road vehicles, especially in hilly areas.
