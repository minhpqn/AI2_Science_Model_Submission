If the differences prevent them from interbreeding with members of the original species, they have evolved into a new species.
Speciation that occurs in this way is called allopatric speciation .
An example is described in the Figure below .
Allopatric Speciation in the Kaibab Squirrel.
The Kaibab squirrel is in the process of becoming a new species.
Less often, a new species arises without geographic separation.
This is called sympatric speciation .
The following example shows one way this can occur.
Hawthorn flies lay eggs in hawthorn trees (see Figure below ).
The eggs hatch into larvae that feed on hawthorn fruits.
Both the flies and trees are native to the U.S.
Apple trees were introduced to the U.S. and often grow near hawthorn trees.
Some hawthorn flies started to lay eggs in nearby apple trees.
When the eggs hatched, the larvae fed on apples.
Over time, the two fly populations—those that fed on hawthorn trees and those that preferred apple trees—evolved reproductive isolation.
Now they are reproductively isolated because they breed at different times.
Their breeding season matches the season when the apple or hawthorn fruits mature.
Because they rarely interbreed, the two populations of flies are evolving other genetic differences.
They appear to be in the process of becoming separate species.
