All reptiles have a cloaca , a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste, located at the base of the tail.
Most reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or hard shell.
These eggs can be placed anywhere as they don't have to be in a moist environment, like the eggs of amphibians.
However, not all species lay eggs, as certain species of squamates can give birth to live young.
Unlike the amphibians, there are no larval stages of development.
The young reptiles look like miniature versions of the adult.
The young reptiles are generally left to fend for themselves.
However, some reptiles provide care for their young.
For example, crocodiles and alligators may defend their young from predators.
Reptiles are also amniotes, which means their embryos are surrounded by a thin membrane.
Reptiles typically reproduce sexually and lay eggs.
