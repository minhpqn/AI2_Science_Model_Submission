Where is most of the fresh water found?
Structure and Properties of Water
No doubt, you are already aware of some of the properties of water.
For example, you probably know that water is tasteless and odorless.
You also probably know that water is transparent, which means that light can pass through it.
This is important for organisms that live in the water, because some of them need sunlight to make food.
Chemical Structure of Water
To understand some of water’s properties, you need to know more about its chemical structure.
As you have seen, each molecule of water consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen.
The oxygen atom in a water molecule attracts negatively-charged electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do.
As a result, the oxygen atom has a slightly negative charge, and the hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge.
A difference in electrical charge between different parts of the same molecule is called polarity , making water a polar molecule .
The diagram in Figure below shows water’s polarity.
Structure of water molecule and solvation
Water Molecule.
This diagram shows the positive and negative parts of a water molecule.
It also depicts how a charge, such as on an ion (Na or Cl, for example) can interact with a water molecule.
Opposites attract when it comes to charged molecules.
In the case of water, the positive (hydrogen) end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative (oxygen) end of a nearby water molecule.
Because of this attraction, weak bonds form between adjacent water molecules, as shown in Figure below .
