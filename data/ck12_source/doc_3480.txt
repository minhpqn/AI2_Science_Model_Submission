After the reaction, the products are released from the enzyme’s active site.
This frees up the enzyme so it can catalyze additional reactions.
The activities of enzymes also depend on the temperature, ionic conditions, and the pH of the surroundings.
Some enzymes work best at acidic pHs, while others work best in neutral environments.
Digestive enzymes secreted in the acidic environment (low pH) of the stomach help break down proteins into smaller molecules.
The main digestive enzyme in the stomach is pepsin , which works best at a pH of about 1.5.
These enzymes would not work optimally at other pHs.
Trypsin is another enzyme in the digestive system, which breaks protein chains in food into smaller parts.
Trypsin works in the small intestine, which is not an acidic environment.
Trypsin's optimum pH is about 8.
Biochemical reactions are optimal at physiological temperatures.
For example, most biochemical reactions work best at the normal body temperature of 98.6˚F.
Many enzymes lose function at lower and higher temperatures.
At higher temperatures, an enzyme’s shape deteriorates.
Only when the temperature comes back to normal does the enzyme regain its shape and normal activity.
Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy needed to start biochemical reactions.
The activities of enzymes depend on the temperature, ionic conditions, and the pH of the surroundings.
