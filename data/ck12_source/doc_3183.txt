Relate wave amplitude to wave energy.
Describe the wavelength of transverse and longitudinal waves.
Relate wavelength to the energy of a wave.
Nobody really has such colorful eyes!
The colors were added digitally after the photo was taken.
They represent all the different colors of light.
Light is a form of energy that travels in waves.
Light of different colors has different wavelengths.
Wavelength is one way of measuring the size of waves.
It is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves, and it is usually measured in meters.
How it is measured is a little different for transverse and longitudinal waves.
In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down at right angles to the direction that the wave travels.
The wavelength of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests, or high points, as shown in the Figure below .

In a longitudinal wave, particles of matter vibrate back and forth in the same direction that the wave travels.
The wavelength of a longitudinal wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent compressions, as shown in the Figure below .
Compressions are the places where particles of the medium crowd close together as the energy of the wave passes through.
