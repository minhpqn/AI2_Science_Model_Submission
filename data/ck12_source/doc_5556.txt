A physical change is a change to a sample of matter in which some properties of the material change, but the identity of the matter does not.
Physical changes can further be classified as reversible or irreversible.
The melted ice cube may be refrozen, so melting is a reversible physical change.
Physical changes that involve a change of state are all reversible.
Other changes of state include vaporization (liquid to gas), freezing (liquid to solid), and condensation (gas to liquid).
Dissolving is also a reversible physical change.
When salt is dissolved into water, the salt is said to have entered the aqueous state.  The salt may be regained by boiling off the water, leaving the salt behind.

When a piece of wood is ground into sawdust, that change is irreversible since the sawdust could not be reconstituted into the same piece of wood that it was before.
Cutting the grass or pulverizing a rock would be other irreversible physical changes.
Fire wood also represents an irreversible physical change since the pieces cannot be put back together to form the tree.

The effect of salt on the freezing and boiling points of water are demonstrated in this MIT video.

A physical change is a change to a sample of matter in which some properties of the material change, but the identity of the matter does not.
In a reversible physical change, the original form of the matter can be restored.
In an irreversible physical change, the original form cannot be restored.
