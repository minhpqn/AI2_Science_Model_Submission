The electromagnetic spectrum spans a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies
On the left side of the electromagnetic spectrum diagram are radio waves and microwaves.
Radio waves have the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves.
They also have the least amount of energy.
On the right side of the diagram are X rays and gamma rays.
They have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves.
They also have the most energy.
Between these two extremes are waves that are commonly called light.
Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light.
The wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels of light fall in between those of radio waves on the left and X rays and gamma rays on the right.
Q:
Which type of light has the longest wavelengths?
A:
Infrared light has the longest wavelengths.
Q:
What sources of infrared light are shown in the diagram?
A:
The sources in the diagram are people and light bulbs, but all living things and most other objects give off infrared light.
Electromagnetic radiation travels in waves through space or matter.
Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.
