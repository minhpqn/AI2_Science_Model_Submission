Different materials in its region of space collided.
Eventually, the material made a planet.
All of the collisions caused Earth to heat up.
Rock and metal melted.
The molten material separated into layers.
Gravity pulled the denser material into the center.
The lighter elements rose to the surface ( Figure below ).
Because the material separated, Earth’s core is made mostly of iron.
Earth’s crust is made mostly of lighter materials.
In between the crust and the core is Earth’s mantle, made of solid rock.

This model for how the Moon formed is the best fit of all of the data scientists have about the Moon.
In the early solar system, there was a lot of space debris.
Asteroids flew around, sometimes striking the planets.
An asteroid the size of Mars smashed into Earth.
The huge amount of energy from the impact melted most of Earth.
The asteroid melted too.
Material from both Earth and the asteroid was thrown out into orbit.
Over time, this material smashed together to form our Moon.
The lunar surface of the Moon is about 4.5 billion years old.
