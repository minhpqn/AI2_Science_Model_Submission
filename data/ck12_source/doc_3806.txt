In the past, giraffes had short necks.
But there was chance variation in neck length.
Some giraffes had necks a little longer than the average.
Then, as now, giraffes fed on tree leaves.
Perhaps the environment changed, and leaves became scarcer.
There would be more giraffes than the trees could support.
Thus, there would be a “struggle for existence.”
Giraffes with longer necks had an advantage.
They could reach leaves other giraffes could not.
Therefore, the long-necked giraffes were more likely to survive and reproduce.
They had greater fitness.
These giraffes passed the long-neck trait to their offspring.
Each generation, the population contained more long-necked giraffes.
Eventually, all giraffes had long necks.
Giraffes feeding on leaves high in trees
Giraffes feed on leaves high in trees.
Their long necks allow them to reach leaves that other ground animals cannot.
As this example shows, chance variations may help a species survive if the environment changes.
Variation among species helps ensure that at least one will be able to survive environmental change.
