Substitute the relevant values into the equation for force to find the answer:
F = m × a = 50 kg × 0.8 m/s 2 = 40 kg • m/s 2 , or 40 N
Scooter going down ramp
Q :
If Xander and his scooter actually had a mass of 40 kg instead of 50 kg, how much force would it take for him to accelerate at 0.8 m/s 2
A :
It would take only 32 N of force (40 kg × 0.8 m/s 2 ).

According to Newton’s second law of motion, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it divided by its mass, or \mathrm{a=\frac{F}{m}} .
This equation for acceleration can be used to calculate the acceleration of an object when its mass and the net force acting on it are known.
The equation for acceleration can be rewritten as F = m × a to calculate the net force acting on an object when its mass and acceleration are known.

What is the equation for calculating the acceleration of an object when its mass and the net force acting on it are known?
Xander’s friend Corey has a skateboard that he rides at Newton’s Skate Park.
That’s Corey doing a jump in the Figure below .
The combined mass of Corey and his skateboard is 60 kg.
At the top of his jump, the net force acting on him is 30 Newtons.
What is his acceleration at that moment?
