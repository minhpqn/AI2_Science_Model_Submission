Characteristics of Insects
Characteristics of Insects include:
Segmented bodies with an exoskeleton .
The outer layer of the exoskeleton is called the cuticle .
It is made up of two layers.
The outer layer, or exocuticle , is thin, waxy, and water-resistant.
The inner layer is much thicker.
The exocuticle is extremely thin in many soft-bodied insects, such as caterpillars.
The segments of the body are organized into three distinct but joined units: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen ( Figure below and Table below ).

Contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive structures.
A nervous system that is divided into a brain and a ventral nerve cord.
Respiration that occurs without lungs.
Insects have a system of internal tubes and sacs that oxygen travels through to reach body tissues.
Air is taken in through the spiracles , openings on the sides of the abdomen.
A closed digestive system, with one long enclosed coiled tube which runs lengthwise through the body, from the mouth to the anus.
