Your body loses water through sweating, breathing, and urination.
The water and other fluids you drink every day help to replace the lost water.
This water ends up circulating in the blood because blood plasma is mostly water.
Many nephrons make up your kidney
The location of nephrons in the kidney.
The fluid collects in the nephron tubules and moves to the bladder through the ureter.
Formation of Urine
The process of urine formation is as follows:
Blood flows into the kidney through the renal artery.
The renal artery connects to capillaries inside the kidney.
Capillaries and nephrons lie very close to each other in the kidney.
The blood pressure within the capillaries causes water, salts, sugars, and urea to leave the capillaries and move into the nephron.
The water and salts move along through the tube-shaped nephron to a lower part of the nephron.
The fluid that remains in the nephron at this point is called urine.
The blood that leaves the kidney in the renal vein has much less waste than the blood that entered the kidney.
The urine is collected in the ureters and is moved to the urinary bladder, where it is stored.
Nephrons filter about Â¼ cup of body fluid per minute.
In a 24-hour period, nephrons filter 180 liters of fluid, and 1.5 liters of the fluid is released as urine.
Urine enters the bladder through the ureters.
Similar to a balloon, the walls of the bladder are stretchy.
