This is the explanation for why atomic electrons are only allowed to have certain amounts of energy and therefore, occupy certain energy levels.
The lowest energy level for an electron is near the nucleus and each quanta of energy added moves the electron to the next distant energy level.
Einstein’s theory says that each light photon has an energy of hf , where  h is Planck’s constant, and f is the frequency.
The emission of a photon of light from an atom indicates a change in energy level for an electron such that
hf = E_{higher} - E_{lower} .
The energy of an orbit is related to the inverse of the square of the orbit number.
The energy of an electron in a given energy level of hydrogen is calculated by
E_n=(-2.17\times 10^{-18} \ J)\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right) .
The radius of an orbit is related to the square of the orbit number.
Bohr calculated allowed electron energy levels for the hydrogen atom and found the emission spectrum of hydrogen to match perfectly with particular electron transitions between his suggested energy levels.
Other electron transitions predicted electromagnetic frequencies outside the visible range and when those were looked for, they were present and also matched precisely with theoretical calculations.
Example Problem:
For the hydrogen atom, determine
the energy of the innermost energy level (n=1) .
the energy of the second energy level.
the difference between the first and second energy levels.
E_n=(-2.17\times 10^{-18} \ J)\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right) \qquad E_1=(-2.17\times 10^{-18} \ J)\left(\frac{1}{1^2}\right)=-2.17 \times 10^{-18} \ J
E_n=(-2.17\times 10^{-18} \ J)\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right) \qquad E_2=(-2.17\times 10^{-18} \ J)\left(\frac{1}{2^2}\right)=-5.43 \times 10^{-19} \ J
E_{2-1}=(-5.43 \times 10^{-19} \ J)-(-2.17 \times 10^{-18} \ J)=1.63 \times 10^{-18} \ J
This is the amount of energy that would need to be added to a 1 st energy level electron to raise it to the second energy level.
