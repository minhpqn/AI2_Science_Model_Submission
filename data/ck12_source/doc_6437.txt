One example of a buffer is a solution made of acetic acid (the weak acid) and sodium acetate (the salt).
The pH of a buffer consisting of 0.50 M CH 3 COOH and 0.50 M CH 3 COONa is 4.74.
If 10.0 mL of 1.0 M HCl is added to 1.0 L of the buffer, the pH only decreases to 4.73.
This ability to “soak up” the additional hydrogen ions from the HCl that was added is due to the reaction below.
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-(aq)+\text{H}^+(aq) \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}(aq)
Since both the acetate ion and the acetic acid were already present in the buffer, the only thing that changes is the ratio of one to the other.
Small changes in that ratio have only very minor effects on the pH.
If 10.0 mL of 1.0 M NaOH were added to another 1.0 L of the same buffer, the pH would only increase to 4.76.
In this case the buffer takes up the additional hydroxide ions.
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
Again the ratio of acetate ion to acetic acid changes slightly, this time causing a very small increase in the pH.
It is possible to add so much acid or base to a buffer that its ability to resist a significant change in pH is overwhelmed.
The buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that can be added to a buffer solution before a large change in pH occurs.
The buffer capacity is exceeded when the number of moles of H + or OH − that are added to the buffer exceeds the number of moles of the buffer components.
