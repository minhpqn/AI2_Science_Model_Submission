In fact, even though we have the same genes, the products of these genes work a little differently in most of us.
And that is what makes us unique.
The human genome is the genome - all the DNA - of Homo sapiens .
Humans have about 3 billion bases of information, divided into roughly 20,000 to 22,000 genes, which are spread among non-coding sequences and distributed among 24 distinct chromosomes (22 autosomes plus the X and Y sex chromosomes ) ( below ).
The genome is all of the hereditary information encoded in the DNA, including the genes and non-coding sequences.

Human Genome, Chromosomes, and Genes.
Each chromosome of the human genome contains many genes as well as noncoding intergenic (between genes) regions.
Each pair of chromosomes is shown here in a different color.
Thanks to the Human Genome Project , scientists now know the DNA sequence of the entire human genome.
The Human Genome Project is an international project that includes scientists from around the world.
It began in 1990, and by 2003, scientists had sequenced all 3 billion base pairs of human DNA.
Now they are trying to identify all the genes in the sequence.
The Human Genome Project has produced a reference sequence of the human genome.
The human genome consists of protein-coding exons , associated introns and regulatory sequences, genes that encode other RNA molecules, and other DNA sequences (sometimes referred to as "junk" DNA), which are regions in which no function as yet been identified.
