Theory that proposes that eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria, evolved from ancient, free-living prokaryotes that invaded other prokaryotic cells.
thylakoid :
Sub-organelle within the chloroplast; site of the light reactions of photosynthesis.
Chloroplasts are the organelles where the process of photosynthesis takes place in plants and algae.
Chloroplasts have stacks of internal membranes called thylakoids; these membranes sequence pigments and electron carrier molecules for efficient photosynthesis.
Thylakoids create compartments, which allow concentration gradients to store energy.
Pigment molecules absorb specific wavelengths (colors) of light; chlorophyll is the primary pigment in photosynthesis.
Electron carrier molecules form electron transport chains, which transfer energy in small steps so that the energy can be stored or used for work.
