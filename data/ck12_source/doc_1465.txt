Eliminate the pollution source:
An underground tank must be pumped dry and then dug out from the ground.
A factory must be required to stop releasing toxic chemicals.
Farms must be more careful about the chemicals they put on their fields.
Monitor the extent of the pollutant:
Scientists test water in wells.
Sometimes they drill wells to test water.
They learn how the groundwater is flowing: how fast and in what direction.
They study the contaminants in the groundwater.
Then they determine where the contaminant plume is going.

Test wells are drilled to monitor groundwater pollution.
Engage in remediation:
A barrier is constructed in the aquifer.
This isolates the contaminated groundwater from the rest of the aquifer.
The contaminated groundwater must be treated.
Remediation is correcting a problem.
The cheapest and easiest way is to treat the water in the aquifer.
Bioremediation is one way of treating the water in the aquifer.
Microorganisms are bioengineered to eat the pollutant.
