Geologists, hikers, and many other people need to be able to say where they are.
Or where they want to go.
They need to be able to mark a location on a map.
The opening photo is of Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park.
It is located at 44°30'N and 110°150'W.
Let’s explore what that means.
To describe your location, you could use a coordinate system.
To do this you need two points.
For example, you could use streets.
Maybe you are at the corner of Maple Avenue and Main Street.
Or you could use a point of reference, a distance and an angle for direction.
If you want to meet up with a friend, you could tell him “I am two blocks due north of your apartment.” Can you identify the point of reference, the distance, and the angle?
Most maps use a grid of lines to help you to find your location.
This grid system is called a geographic coordinate system .
Using this system you can define your location by two numbers, latitude and longitude.
