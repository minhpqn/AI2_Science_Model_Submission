angiosperm :
Seed plant in which seeds develop within a vessel, which may later become the fruit.
anther :
The male reproductive structure of a flower; site of meiosis and pollen development.
artificial fertilization :
The process of transferring pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part of another flower; done in order to have seeds that will grow into plants that have a desired trait.
characteristic :
A heritable feature, such as flower color.
cross-pollination :
Fertilization in which pollen from one flower pollinates a flower on a different plant.
heritable factors :
The unit which is passed from parent to offspring; know known as the gene.
pollen :
Plant reproductive structure which protects male sex cells during pollination.
pollination :
Fertilization in plants; process in which pollen is transferred to female gametes in an ovary.
self-pollination :
Fertilization in which the pollen from a flower on a single plant transfers to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant.
stigma :
Part of the female reproductive structures of a flower; top section of a pistil, often "sticky" to catch pollen; a photosensitive structure that orients the movement of the cell towards light; known as an eyespot.
