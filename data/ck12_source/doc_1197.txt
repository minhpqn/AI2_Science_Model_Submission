Most water on Earth, like the water in the oceans, contains elements.
The elements are mixed evenly through the water.
Water plus other substances makes a solution.
The particles are so small that they will not come out when you filter the water.
But the elements in water can form solid mineral deposits.
Minerals from Salt Water
Fresh water contains a small amount of dissolved elements.
Salt water contains many more dissolved elements.
Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved substances.
When the water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid layer of minerals ( Figure below ).
At this time, the particles come together to form minerals.
These solids sink to the bottom.
The amount of mineral formed is the same as the amount dissolved in the water.
Seawater is salty enough for minerals to precipitate as solids.
Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California, or Utah's Great Salt Lake, can also precipitate salts.
Crystals form when water evaporates
When the water in glass A evaporates, the dissolved mineral particles are left behind.
Salt easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite ( Figure below ).
The limestone towers pictured below are made mostly of the mineral calcite.
The calcite was deposited in the salty and alkaline water of Mono Lake, in California.
