Muscles can only contract.
They cannot actively extend, or lengthen.
Therefore, to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must work in opposition.
For example, the biceps and triceps muscles of the upper arm work in opposition to bend and extend the arm at the elbow (see Figure below ).
You can watch an animation of these two muscles working in opposition at the link below.

Opposing muscles example
Triceps and biceps muscles in the upper arm are opposing muscles.
Use It or Lose It
In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ).
Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength.
In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood.
Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency.
Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles.
If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.
This exercise pits human muscles against a force.
What force is it?
Skeletal muscles are attached to the skeleton and cause bones to move when they contract.
