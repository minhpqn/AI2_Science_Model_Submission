You’ll often see the speed of sound given as 343 meters per second.
But that’s just the speed of sound under a certain set of conditions, specifically, through dry air at 20 °C.
The speed of sound may be very different through other matter or at other temperatures.
Speed of Sound in Different Media
Sound waves are mechanical waves, and mechanical waves can only travel through matter.
The matter through which the waves travel is called the medium (plural, media).
The Table below gives the speed of sound in several different media.
Generally, sound waves travel most quickly through solids, followed by liquids, and then by gases.
Particles of matter are closest together in solids and farthest apart in gases.
When particles are closer together, they can more quickly pass the energy of vibrations to nearby particles.

Q:
The table gives the speed of sound in dry air.
Do you think that sound travels more or less quickly through air that contains water vapor? (Hint:
Compare the speed of sound in water and air in the table.)
A:
Sound travels at a higher speed through water than air, so it travels more quickly through air that contains water vapor than it does through dry air.
