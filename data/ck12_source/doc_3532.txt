Plant cells with visible chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to produce sugars for food.
Chloroplasts look like flat discs and are usually 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter and 1 micrometer thick.
A model of a chloroplast is shown in Figure below .
The chloroplast is enclosed by an inner and an outer phospholipid membrane.
Between these two layers is the intermembrane space.
The fluid within the chloroplast is called the stroma , and it contains one or more molecules of small, circular DNA.
The stroma also has ribosomes.
Within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids , sub-organelles that are the site of photosynthesis.
The thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana (singular: granum).
A thylakoid has a flattened disk shape.
Inside it is an empty area called the thylakoid space or lumen.
Photosynthesis takes place on the thylakoid membrane.
Within the thylakoid membrane is the complex of proteins and light-absorbing pigments, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids.
This complex allows capture of light energy from many wavelengths because chlorophyll and carotenoids both absorb different wavelengths of light.
These will be further discussed in the "Photosynthesis" concept.

Plant cells have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts.
The cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell, providing structural support and protection.
