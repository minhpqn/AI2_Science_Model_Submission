Define autotroph and heterotroph.
What position do autotrophs fill in a food chain?
Give examples of autotrophs and heterotrophs.
Describe energy production in photoautotrophs.
What is a chemoheterotroph?
Compare autotrophs to heterotrophs, and describe the relationship between these two groups of organisms.
Name and describe the two types of food making processes found among autotrophs.
Which is quantitatively more important to life on earth?
Describe the flow of energy through a typical food chain (describing "what eats what"), including the original source of that energy and its ultimate form after use.
Glucose and ATP
Write the chemical formula of glucose.
Explain the structure of ATP.
Compare the roles of glucose and ATP.
Needs lots of energy?
To run a marathon, probably.
Where does this extra energy come from?
Carbohydrate loading is a strategy used by endurance athletes to maximize the storage of energy, in the form of glycogen, in the muscles.
Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, which is then turned into ATP through the process of cellular respiration.
