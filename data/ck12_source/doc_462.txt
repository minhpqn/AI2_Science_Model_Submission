Kidney failure can be caused by an accident that injures the kidneys, the loss of a lot of blood, or by some drugs and poisons.
Kidney failure may lead to permanent loss of kidney function.
But if the kidneys are not seriously damaged, they may recover.
Chronic kidney disease is the slow decrease in kidney function that may lead to permanent kidney failure.
A person who has lost kidney function may need to get kidney dialysis.
Kidney dialysis is the process of filtering the blood of wastes using a machine.
A dialysis machine ( Figure below ) filters waste from the blood by pumping the blood through a fake kidney.
The filtered blood is then returned to the patient’s body.
During dialysis, a patient's blood is filtered and returned to the body
During dialysis, a patient’s blood is sent through a filter that removes waste products.
The clean blood is returned to the body.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bacterial infections of any part of the urinary tract.
When bacteria get into the bladder or kidney and produce more bacteria in the urine, they cause a UTI.
The most common type of UTI is a bladder infection.
Women get UTIs more often than men.
UTIs are often treated with antibiotics.
Most UTIs are not serious, but some infections can lead to serious problems.
Long lasting kidney infections can cause permanent damage, including kidney scars, poor kidney function, high blood pressure, and other problems.
Some sudden kidney infections can be life threatening, especially if the bacteria enter the bloodstream, a condition called septicemia.
