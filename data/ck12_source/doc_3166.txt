A steam engine is an external combustion engine.
How an External Combustion Engine Works
An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside the engine.
The burning fuel releases thermal energy, which is used to heat water and change it to steam.
The pressure of the steam moves a piston back and forth inside a cylinder.
The kinetic energy of the moving piston can be used to turn a vehicleâ€™s wheels, a turbine, or other mechanical device.
The Figure below explains in greater detail how this type of engine works.

Q:
What type of energy does the piston have when it moves back and forth inside the cylinder?
A:
Like anything else that is moving, the moving piston has kinetic energy.
A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the thermal energy to do work.
An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside the engine.
An external combustion engine burns fuel to heat water and produce steam.
The steam is under pressure and is used to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder.
As the piston moves back and forth, it moves a piston rod, which can do work.
