A woman will release an egg once each month until she is in her 40s.
A girl is born with over a million eggs.
They die off and by puberty about 40,000 remain.
Eggs are very big cells.
In fact, they are the biggest cells in the human female body. (How many egg cells are in the human male body?) An egg is about 30 times as wide as a sperm cell!
You can even see an egg cell without a microscope.
Like a sperm cell, the egg contains a nucleus with half the number of chromosomes as other body cells.
Unlike a sperm cell, the egg contains a lot of cytoplasm , the contents of the cell, which is why it is so big.
The egg also does not have a tail.
Egg production takes place in the ovaries.
It takes several steps to make an egg:
Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis (cell division), producing identical cells.
The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis .
But they only go through the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at that time.
They go through the second stage of cell division after the female goes through puberty.
In a mature female, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month.
The drawing below shows how this happens ( Figure below ).
As you can see from the figure, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle .
The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes.
The follicle protects the egg as it matures in the ovary.
