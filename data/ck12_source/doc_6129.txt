A hydrogen bond is the attraction between a lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of one molecule and the electron-deficient hydrogen atom of a nearby molecule.
Because each oxygen atom has two lone pairs, it can make hydrogen bonds to the hydrogen atoms of two separate other molecules.  The Figure below shows the result â€“ an approximately tetrahedral geometry around each oxygen atom consisting of two covalent bonds and two hydrogen bonds.
The geometry around each oxygen atom in water is tetrahedral because it has two covalent and two hydrogen bonds
As a result of two covalent bonds and two hydrogen bonds, the geometry around each oxygen atom is approximately tetrahedral.
Water is a molecular compound consisting of polar molecules that have a bent shape.
The oxygen atom acquires a partial negative charge while the hydrogen atom acquires a partial positive charge.

polar bond:  A covalent bond in which electrons are shared unequally between two electrons.
Structure of Ice
Describe the structure of ice.
Explain why ice is less dense that liquid water.
Ice is unique because water expands as it is frozen
