Like baby boys, baby girls are born with all their reproductive organs present but immature and unable to function.
Female reproductive organs also grow very little until puberty.
Girls begin puberty a year or two earlier than boys, at an average age of 10 years.
Girls also complete puberty sooner than boys, in about 4 years instead of 6.
Puberty in girls starts when the hypothalamus “tells” the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the ovaries.
Two pituitary hormones are involved: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) .
These hormones stimulate the ovary to produce estrogen .
Estrogen, in turn, promotes growth and other physical changes of puberty.
It stimulates growth and development of the internal reproductive organs, breasts, and pubic hair (see Figure below ).
You can watch an animation of these and other changes that girls experience during puberty at this link:

Two obvious changes of puberty in girls are growth and development of the breasts and pubic hair.
The stages begin around age 10 and are completed by about age 14.
Adolescent Growth Spurt
Like boys, girls also go through an adolescent growth spurt .
However, girls typically start their growth spurt a year or two earlier than boys (and therefore a couple of centimeters shorter, on average).
Girls also have a shorter growth spurt.
For example, they typically reach their adult height by about age 15.
In addition, girls generally do not grow as fast as boys do during the growth spurt, even at their peak rate of growth.
