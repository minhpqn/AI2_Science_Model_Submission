Transfer of Sequence Information
The polymers that comprise DNA, RNA and amino acids are linear polymers.
Each monomer (a nucleotide or amino acid) is connected to, at most, two other monomers.
The sequence of their monomers encodes genetic information.
The transfers of information described by the central dogma based on the order of monomers that make this genetic information.
The polymer's (DNA or RNA) sequence is used as a template for the construction of another polymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original polymer's sequence.
The DNA sequence is used to encode RNA, and the RNA sequence is used to encode protein.
Are those the only transfers of genetic information?
With three biopolymers (DNA, RNA, and protein), there could be as many as nine potential types of transfers.
The central dogma classes these into three groups of three
three general transfers,
three special transfers,
three unknown transfers.
The three general transfers are believed to occur normally in most cells.
These describe the normal flow of biological information.
DNA is replicated, DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into protein.
The three special transfers are known to occur under special conditions, such as with some viruses.
