Reaction where a carboxylic acid acts as an acid
Equilibrium between carboxyl group and carboxylate anion.
The smaller members of the aliphatic carboxylic acid series are colorless, volatile liquids with strong odors.
Ethanoic acid is commonly known as acetic acid and common household vinegar is a 5% solution of acetic acid.
Larger carboxylic acids are solids with low melting points.
There are a great many aromatic carboxylic acids, which are all crystalline solids.
Carboxylic acids can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and thus have relatively high melting and boiling points compared to other organic compounds that cannot hydrogen bond.
Carboxylic acids with shorter carbon chains are very soluble in water, while those with longer carbon chains are less soluble.
Many carboxylic acids occur naturally in plants and animals.
Citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons contain citric acid.
Citric acid gives citrus fruits their sour or tart flavor
Citric acid is a large carboxylic acid with three ionizable hydrogen atoms.
It is found in citrus fruits and gives them their sour or tart flavor.
Ethanoic and citric acids are frequently added to foods to give them a tart flavor.
Benzoic, propanoic, and sorbic acids are used as food preservatives because of their ability to kill microorganisms that can lead to spoilage.
Methanoic and ethanoic acids are widely used in industry as starting points for the manufacture of paints, adhesives, and coatings.
The structure and nomenclature of carboxylic acids are given.
Physical properties of carboxylic acids are listed.
