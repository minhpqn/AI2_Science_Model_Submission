Pieces of the glacier break off and fall into the water.
These icebergs may be as large as a ten-story building.
Where are the Glaciers?
Nearly all glacial ice is in the polar regions.
The largest ice sheets are in Antarctica and Greenland.
The remaining 1% of Earth's ice is found elsewhere, like in the mountains, for example.
At higher altitudes, temperatures are colder.
Snow is more likely to fall and not melt.
Except Australia, every continent has glaciers in the high mountains.
Types of Glaciers
The types of glaciers are:
Continental glaciers are large ice sheets that cover relatively flat ground.
These glaciers flow outward from where the greatest amounts of snow and ice accumulate.
Alpine (valley) glaciers flow downhill.
Ice accumulates near the top of a mountain and then travels down existing valleys ( Figure below ).

Where do you think the word "alpine" came from?
Ice caps are large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley.
An ice cap can bury an entire mountain range or region ( Figure below ).
