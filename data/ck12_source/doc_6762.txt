The Big Idea
The law of conservation of momentum states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of momentum is constant.
Momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but none is lost or gained.
If a system has its momentum changed from the outside it is caused by an impulse, which transfers momentum from one body to another.
When any two bodies in the universe interact, they can exchange energy, momentum, or both.
The law of conservation of energy states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of energy remains fixed.
Energy is transferred from one form to another, but not lost or gained.
If energy is put into a system from the outside or vice versa it is often in the form of work, which is a transfer of energy between bodies.
Describe potential energy and how to calculate it.
Learn what potential energy is and how to calculate the potential energy of gravity and also that of a spring.
Gravitational potential energy
U_g= m g h \begin{cases} h & \text{height above the ground in meters(m)}\\\g & \text{acceleration due to gravity,}\ 9.8\ \text{m/s}^{2}\\\ U_{g} & \text{Potential energy of gravity (in Joules; 1 J} = 1 \text{kg} \ \text{m}^{2}/\text{s}^{2}\text{)}\end{cases}
Spring potential energy
U_{sp} = \tfrac{1}{2}k{\Delta x}^2 \begin{cases}k & \text{spring constant measured in Newtons(N) per meters(m)}\\\x & \text{amount spring is displaced from resting position}\\\ U_{sp} & \text{potential energy of a spring (in Joules; 1 J} = 1 \text{kg} \ \text{m}^{2}/\text{s}^{2}\text{)}\end{cases}
A 2 kg block of wood is suspended 5m above a spring of spring constant 3000 N/m.
When the block is dropped on the spring, how far will the spring be compressed from it's equilibrium position.
We can solve for the distance the spring will be compressed using conservation of energy.
In this problem, the gravitational potential energy of the block will be turned into spring potential energy.
U_g&=U_{sp} && \text{start with by setting the gravitational potential energy equal to the spring potential energy}\\\mgh&=\frac{1}{2}k\Delta x^2 && \text{substitute the equations for gravitational and spring potential energy}\\\\Delta x&=\sqrt{\frac{2mgh}{k}} && \text{solve for } \Delta x\\\\Delta x&=\sqrt{\frac{2*2\;\text{kg} * 9.8\;\text{m/s}^2 * 5\;\text{m}}{3000\;\text{N/m}}} && \text{plug in the known values}\\\\Delta x&=.26\;\text{m}\\\
If you lift a 30 kg weight 0.5 meters, how much Potential energy has it gained?
