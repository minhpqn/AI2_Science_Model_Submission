Exercise improves both muscular strength and muscular endurance.
Muscular strength is the ability of a muscle to use force during a contraction.
Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle to continue to contract over a long time without getting tired.
Exercises are grouped into three types depending on the effect they have on the body:
Aerobic exercises , such as cycling, walking, and running, increase muscular endurance and cardiovascular health.
Anaerobic exercises , such as weight training or sprinting, increase muscle strength.
Flexibility exercises, such as stretching, improve the range of motion of muscles and joints.
Regular stretching helps people avoid activity-related injuries.
Anaerobic Exercise and Muscular Strength
Anaerobic exercises comprise brief periods of physical exertion and high-intensity, strength-training activities.
Anaerobic exercises cause muscles to get bigger and stronger.
Anaerobic exercises use a resistance against which the muscle has to work to lift or push away.
The resistance can be a weight or a personâ€™s own body weight ( Figure below ).
Sports such as basketball, tennis, football and even baseball can be anaerobic.
Anaerobic exercise works your muscles against resistance
Anaerobic exercises involve the muscles working against resistance.
In this case the resistance is the weight of a barbell.
Aerobic Exercise and Muscular Endurance
Aerobic exercises are exercises in which a low to moderate level of exertion can be sustained over long periods.
These are exercises that cause your heart to beat faster and allow your muscles to use oxygen to contract.
