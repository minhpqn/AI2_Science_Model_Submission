Q:
Can you find the six different forms of energy in the photo of the guitar player (See opening image)?
A:
The guitarist uses mechanical energy to pluck the strings of the guitar.
He gets the energy he needs to perform from chemical energy in food he ate earlier in the day.
The stage lights use electrical energy , which they change to light energy and thermal energy (commonly called heat).
The guitar produces sound energy when the guitarist plucks the strings.
Seven Forms of Energy
The different forms of energy are defined and illustrated below.

Mechanical energy is the energy of movement.
It is found in objects that are moving or have the potential to move.
Drummers generate mechanical energy to hit drums and cymbals
This drummer has mechanical energy as he moves the drumsticks to hit the drums and cymbals.
The moving drumsticks also have mechanical energy, but they would have mechanical energy even if they weren't moving.
That's because they have the potential to fall when the drummer is holding them above the floor.
This potential energy is due to gravity.
