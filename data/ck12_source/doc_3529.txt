Describe the three types of vesicles.
Plant Cell Structures
List the special structures of plant cells.
Explain the function of the cell wall.
Summarize the role of the central vacuole.
Describe the structure and function of a chloroplast.
What do plants have to do that animals don't?
Many plant cells are green.
Why?
Plant cells also usually have a distinct shape.
The rigid exterior around the cells is necessary to allow the plants to grow upright.
Animal cells do not have these rigid exteriors.
There are other distinct differences between plant and animal cells.
These will be the focus of this concept.
Special Structures in Plant Cells
Most organelles are common to both animal and plant cells.
However, plant cells also have features that animal cells do not have: a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts.
Plants have very different lifestyles from animals, and these differences are apparent when you examine the structure of the plant cell.
Plants make their own food in a process called photosynthesis .
They take in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) and convert them into sugars.
