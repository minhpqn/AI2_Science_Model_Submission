So the distance from the ship to the bottom of the water is:
Distance = 1437 m/s × 2 s = 2874 m
Another use of ultrasound is to “see” inside the human body.
This use of ultrasound is called ultrasonography.
Harmless ultrasound waves are sent inside the body, and the reflected waves are used to create an image on a screen.
This technology is used to examine internal organs and unborn babies without risk to the patient.
You can see a doctor using ultrasound in the Figure below .
You can watch an animation showing how ultrasonography works at this URL:

Ultrasound is sound that has a wave frequency higher than the human ear can detect.
It includes all sounds with wave frequencies higher than 20,000 waves per second, or 20,000 hertz (Hz).
Animals such as bats and dolphins send out ultrasound waves and use their echoes to identify the locations of objects they cannot see.
This is called echolocation.
Sonar stands for sound navigation and ranging.
It is used to locate underwater objects such as submarines.
Ultrasonography is the use of reflected ultrasound waves to “see” inside the body.

Then answer the questions below.
Why do dolphins use echolocation?
Describe how dolphins use echolocation.
