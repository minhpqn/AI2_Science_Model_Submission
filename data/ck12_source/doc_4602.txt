Components of the lymphatic system
The lymphatic system consists of organs, vessels, and lymph.
Lymphatic Vessels and Lymph
Lymphatic vessels make up a body-wide circulatory system.
The fluid they circulate is lymph.
Lymph is a fluid that leaks out of capillaries into spaces between cells.
As the lymph accumulates between cells, it diffuses into tiny lymphatic vessels.
The lymph then moves through the lymphatic system from smaller to larger vessels.
It finally drains back into the bloodstream in the chest.
As lymph passes through the lymphatic vessels, pathogens are filtered out at small structures called lymph nodes (see Figure above ).
The filtered pathogens are destroyed by lymphocytes.
The human body has as many as two trillion lymphocytes, and lymphocytes make up about 25% of all leukocytes.
The majority of lymphocytes are found in the lymphatic system, where they are most likely to encounter pathogens.
The rest are found in the blood.
There are two major types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells.
These cells get their names from the organs in which they mature.
B cells mature in bone marrow, and T cells mature in the thymus.
Both B and T cells recognize and respond to particular pathogens.
B cells and T cells actually recognize and respond to antigens on pathogens.
Antigens are molecules that the immune system recognizes as foreign to the body.
