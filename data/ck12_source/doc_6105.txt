It is necessary to use Kelvin for the temperature and it is conventional to use the SI unit of liters for the volume.
However, pressure is commonly measured in one of three units: kPa, atm, or mmHg.
Therefore,  R can have three different values.
We will demonstrate how  R is calculated when the pressure is measured in kPa.
Recall that the volume of 1.00 mol of any gas at STP is measured to be 22.414 L.
We can substitute 101.325 kPa for pressure, 22.414 L for volume, and 273.15 K for temperature into the ideal gas equation and solve for R .
R=\frac{PV}{nT}=\frac{101.325 \ \text{kPa} \times 22.414 \text{ L}}{1.000 \ \text{mol} \times 273.15 \text{ K}}=8.314 \ \text{kPa} \cdot \text{L/K} \cdot \text{mol}
This is the value of  R that is to be used in the ideal gas equation when the pressure is given in kPa.
The Table below shows a summary of this and the other possible values of R .
It is important to choose the correct value of  R to use for a given problem.
Values of the Ideal Gas Constant
Unit of P
Unit of V
Unit of n
Unit of T
Value and unit of R
8.314 \ \text{J/K} \cdot \text{mol}
0.08206 \ \text{L} \cdot \text{atm/K} \cdot \text{mol}
62.36 \text{ L} \cdot \text{mmHg/K} \cdot \text{mol}
Notice that the unit for  R when the pressure is in kPa has been changed to J/K â€¢ mol.
