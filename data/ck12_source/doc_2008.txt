What would happen to life on Earth if there were no decomposers?
Why?
Nitrogen Cycle in Ecosystems
Describe nitrogen's roles as a nutrient.
Define nitrogen fixation, and explain how it occurs.
Why are these fish dead?
In a dead zone, there is so little oxygen that fish can't live.
What causes the oxygen to disappear?
Indirectly, it's nitrogen.
The Nitrogen Cycle
Living things need nitrogen.
Nitrogen is a key element in proteins.
Like carbon, nitrogen cycles through ecosystems.
The nitrogen cycle is pictured below ( Figure below ).
Diagram of the nitrogen cycle
The nitrogen cycle includes air, soil, and living things.
Air is about 78 percent nitrogen.
Decomposers release nitrogen into the air from dead organisms and their wastes.
However, producers such as plants canâ€™t use these forms of nitrogen.
Nitrogen must combine with other elements before producers can use it.
