How do humans adapt to their environment?
It could be said that the human population does not have to adapt to its environment, but forces the environment to change to suit us.
We can live practically anywhere we want, eat all types of food, and build all types of housing.
Because of all of these "adaptations," our population has grown, after a slow start, considerably fast.
The Human Population
Humans have been called the most successful "weed species" Earth has ever seen.
Like weeds, human populations are fast growing.
They also disperse rapidly.
They have colonized habitats from pole to pole.
Overall, the human population has had a pattern of exponential growth, as shown in Figure below .
The population increased very slowly at first.
As it increased in size, so did its rate of growth.

Growth of the Human Population.
This graph gives an overview of human population growth since 10,000 BC.
It took until about 1800 AD for the number of humans to reach 1 billion.
It took only a little over 100 years for the number to reach 2 billion.
The human population recently passed the 7 billion mark!
Why do you think the human population began growing so fast?
