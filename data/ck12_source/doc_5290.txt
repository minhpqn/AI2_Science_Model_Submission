This goalie's main job is to block the puck from getting into the net.
Is it possible for one gene to block another?
With genes, almost anything seems possible.
Under the right conditions, one gene may inhibit another gene.
That's how some people end up with red hair.
And it's called epistasis.
Traits controlled by more than two alleles have multiple alleles .
Although any one person usually has only two alleles for a gene, more than two alleles can exist in the population's gene pool .
Theoretically, any base change will result in a new allele.
In fact, within the human population, it may be safe to say that most human genes have more than two alleles.
Whereas, we think of base changes, or mutations, as resulting in a new phenotype or disease, many base changes result in alleles that do not cause significant change in phenotypes.
This is common in collagen genes, for example.
Type I and type II collagen are fibrillar proteins composed of a triple helix.
As these are structural proteins found in bone and cartilage, a triple helix adds strength to the matrix with these proteins.
To form a triple helix structure, a glycine residue must be placed at every third amino acid within the fibrillar segment of the protein.
The fibrillar portion of the protein is composed of Gly-X-Y motif, where X and Y represent two additional amino acids.
As glycine is encoded by four codons:
GGG, GGC, GGA, GGU, any change of sequence in the third position of the codon will not have an effect on the protein structure.
Furthermore some changes in the X and Y positions of the Gly-X-Y motif may not cause significant phenotypic changes.
However, other changes may have significant, even lethal consequences.
