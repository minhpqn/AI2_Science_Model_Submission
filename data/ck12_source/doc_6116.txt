The partial pressure of a gas is the contribution that gas makes to the total pressure when the gas is part of a mixture.
The partial pressure of a gas is indicated by a  P with a subscript that is the symbol or formula of that gas.
The partial pressure of nitrogen is represented by  P_{N_2} .
Dalton’s law of partial pressures states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of all of the partial pressures of the component gases.
Dalton’s law can be expressed with the following equation:
The Figure below shows two gases that are in separate, equal-sized containers at the same temperature and pressure.
Each exerts a different pressure,  P_1 and P_2 , reflective of the number of particles in the container.
On the right, the two gases are combined into the same container, with no volume change.
The total pressure of the gas mixture is equal to the sum of the individual pressures.
If P_1 = 300 \text{ mmHg} and P_2 = 500 \text{ mmHg} , then P_{\text{Total}}=800 \text{ mmHg} .
Dalton's law states that the pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the partial pressure of the components
Dalton’s law says that the pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the partial pressures of the combining gases.
The total pressure in a system is equal to the sums of the partial pressures of the gases present.

What is the foundation for Dalton’s law?
Argon makes up about 0.93% of our atmosphere.
If the atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg, what is the pressure contributed by argon?
On a given day, the water vapor in the air is 2.5%.
If the partial pressure of the vapor is 19.4 mm Hg, what is the atmospheric pressure?
Partial pressure:
