The gas molecules are moving and are a certain distance apart from one another.
An increase in pressure pushes the molecules closer together, reducing the volume.
If the pressure is decreased, the gases are free to move about in a larger volume.
Robert Boyle states that PV is constant at a given temperature
Mathematically, Boyle’s law can be expressed by the equation:
P \times V = k
The  k is a constant for a given sample of gas and depends only on the mass of the gas and the temperature.
The Table below shows pressure and volume data for a set amount of gas at a constant temperature.
The third column represents the value of the constant  (k) for this data and is always equal to the pressure multiplied by the volume.
As one of the variables changes, the other changes in such a way that the product of  P \times V always remains the same.
In this particular case, that constant is 500 atm · ml.
P \times V = k (\text{atm} \cdot \text{mL})
A graph of the data in the table further illustrates the inverse relationship nature of Boyle’s Law (see Figure below ).
Volume is plotted on the x -axis, with the corresponding pressure on the y -axis.
The pressure of a gas decreases as its volume increases
The pressure of a gas decreases as the volume increases, making Boyle’s law an inverse relationship.
Boyle’s Law can be used to compare changing conditions for a gas.
We use P_1 and  V_1 to stand for the initial pressure and initial volume of a gas.
After a change has been made,  P_2 and  V_2 stand for the final pressure and volume.
The mathematical relationship of Boyle’s Law becomes:
