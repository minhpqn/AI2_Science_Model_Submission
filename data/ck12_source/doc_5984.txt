Write the balanced chemical equation for the combination reaction of potassium with oxygen.
Step 1:
Plan the problem
Make sure formulas of all reactants and products are correct before balancing the equation.
Oxygen gas is a diatomic molecule.
Potassium oxide is an ionic compound and so its formula is constructed by the crisscross method.
Potassium as an ion becomes K + , while the oxide ion is O 2âˆ’ .
Step 2:
Solve
The skeleton (unbalanced) equation:
K(s)+O_2(g) \rightarrow K_2O(s)
The equation is then easily balanced with coefficients.
4\text{K}(s)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{K}_2\text{O}(s)
Step 3:
Think about your result
Formulas are correct and the resulting combination reaction is balanced.
Combination reactions can also take place when an element reacts with a compound to form a new compound composed of a larger number of atoms.
Carbon monoxide reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide according to the equation:
2\text{CO}(g)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{CO}_2(g)
Two compounds may also react to from a more complex compound.
