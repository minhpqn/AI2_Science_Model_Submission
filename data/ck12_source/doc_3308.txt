How is electric potential energy related to the direction an electric charge spontaneously moves?
What is voltage, and why is it needed for charges to flow in an electric current?
Direct and Alternating Current
Distinguish between direct current and alternating current.
To use an electric appliance, you have to plug it into an outlet unless it has batteries.
This may be all you need to know in order to use electric current.
But did you ever wonder what electric current is or how it flows through wires inside the walls of your home?
Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges.
The charges may flow in just one direction, or they may keep reversing direction.
You can watch an animation of both types of current at this URL:

When current flows in just one direction, it is called direct current (DC) .
The diagram below shows how direct current flows through a simple circuit.
An example of direct current is the current that flows through a battery-powered flashlight.
In addition to batteries, solar cells and fuel cells can also provide direct current.
When current keeps reversing direction, it is called alternating current (AC) .
You can see how it works in the two diagrams below.
The current that comes from a power plant and supplies electricity to homes and businesses is alternating current.
The current changes direction 60 times per second.
It happens so quickly that the light bulb doesnâ€™t have a chance to stop glowing when the reversals occur.
