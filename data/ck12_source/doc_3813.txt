Most vertebrates, except for fish, lose their gill slits by adulthood.
Some of them also lose their tail.
In humans, the tail is reduced to the tail bone.
Thus, similarities organisms share as embryos may be gone by adulthood.
This is why it is valuable to compare organisms in the embryonic stage.
See for additional information and a comparative diagram of human, monkey, pig, chicken and salamander embryos.
Structures like the human tail bone and whale pelvis are called vestigial structures .
Evolution has reduced their size because the structures are no longer used.
The human appendix is another example of a vestigial structure.
It is a tiny remnant of a once-larger organ.
In a distant ancestor, it was needed to digest food.
It serves no purpose in humans today.
Why do you think structures that are no longer used shrink in size?
Why might a full-sized, unused structure reduce an organismâ€™s fitness?
Darwin could compare only the anatomy and embryos of living things.
Today, scientists can compare their DNA.
Similar DNA sequences are the strongest evidence for evolution from a common ancestor.
More similarities in the DNA sequence is evidence for a closer evolutionary relationship.
Look at the cladogram in the Figure below .
It shows how humans and apes are related based on their DNA sequences.
