This stage also releases oxygen as a waste product.
Stage II is called the Calvin cycle .
This stage combines carbon from carbon dioxide in the air and uses the chemical energy in ATP and NADPH to make glucose.
The two stages of photosynthesis are the light reactions and the Calvin cycle.
Do you see how the two stages are related?
Before you read about these two stages of photosynthesis in greater detail, you need to know more about the chloroplast, where the two stages take place.
Chloroplasts:
Theaters for Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis , the process of turning the energy of sunlight into ‘‘food,’’ is divided into two basic sets of reactions, known as the light reactions and the Calvin cycle, which uses carbon dioxide.
As you study the details in other concepts, refer frequently to the chemical equation of photosynthesis: 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Light Energy → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 .
Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle specific to plant cells.
If you examine a single leaf of a Winter Jasmine leaf, shown in Figure below , under a microscope, you will see within each cell dozens of small green ovals.
These are chloroplasts , the organelles which conduct photosynthesis in plants and algae.
Chloroplasts closely resemble some types of bacteria and even contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes.
In fact, the endosymbiotic theory holds that chloroplasts were once independently living bacteria (prokaryotes).
So when we say that photosynthesis occurs within chloroplasts, we speak not only of the organelles within plants and algae, but also of some bacteria – in other words, virtually all photosynthetic autotrophs.
Chloroplasts under a microscope

Viewed under a microscope, many green chloroplasts are visible.
Each chloroplast contains neat stacks called grana (singular, granum).
