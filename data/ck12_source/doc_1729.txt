Some people think this is where the horse latitudes got their name.
More Effects of Latitude on Climate
We saw that the amount of solar radiation an area receives depends on its latitude.
The amount of solar radiation affects the temperature of a region.
Latitude has other effects on climate.
Latitude and Prevailing Winds
Global air currents cause global winds.
The figure below shows the direction that these winds blow ( Figure below ).
Global winds are the prevailing, or usual, winds at a given latitude.
The winds move air masses, which causes weather.
The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area.
For example, a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean.
An east wind might bring cold dry air from over a mountain range.
Which wind prevails has a big effect on the climate.
What if the prevailing winds are westerlies?
The westerlies blow from nearer the Equator to farther from the Equator.
How would they affect the climate?

The usual direction of the wind where you live depends on your latitude.
This determines where you are in the global wind belts.
