Explain the life cycles of algae.
Many people, if not most, believe seaweed to be a plant.
Is it?
Seaweed is actually a plant-like protist, which are also known as algae.
The green color is due to what pigment?
Algae, like plants, obtain their energy through photosynthesis.
Plant-Like Protists:
Algae
Plant-like protists are called algae (singular, alga).
They are a large and diverse group.
Some algae, the diatoms , are single-celled.
Others, such as seaweed , are multicellular (see Figure below ).
Both unicellular diatoms and multicellular seaweed are algae
Diatoms are single-celled algae.
Other forms of algae are multicellular.
Why are algae considered plant-like?
The main reason is that they contain chloroplasts and produce food through photosynthesis .
However, they lack many other structures of true plants.
For example, algae do not have roots, stems, or leaves.
Some algae also differ from plants in being motile.
