The velocity versus time graph in the video is divided into six sections.
In how many of these sections is the velocity constant?
In how many sections of the graph is the velocity zero?
What does the area under the curve of a velocity versus time graph represent?
On a one day vacation, Jane traveled 340 miles in 8.0 hours.
What was her average speed?
An object on a number line moved from x = 12 m to x = 124 m and moved back to x = 98 m.
The time interval for all the motion was 10 s.  What was the average velocity of the object?
An object on a number line moved from x = 15 cm to x = 165 cm and then moved back to x = 25 cm, all in a time of 100 seconds.
What was the average velocity of the object?
What was the average speed of the object?
speed:
Distance travelled per unit time.
velocity:
A vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion or, in other terms, the rate and direction of the change in the position of an object.
Define instantaneous velocity.
Plot and interpret position vs time graphs.
Determine the slope of a curve on a position vs time graph.
