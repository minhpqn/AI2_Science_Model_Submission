As a result, they may be attracted as much or more by the nucleus of another atom than they are by their own nucleus.
Electron Dot Diagrams
Because valence electrons are so important, atoms are often represented by simple diagrams that show only their valence electrons.
These are called electron dot diagrams, and three are shown below.
In this type of diagram, an element's chemical symbol is surrounded by dots that represent the valence electrons.
Typically, the dots are drawn as if there is a square surrounding the element symbol with up to two dots per side.
An element never has more than eight valence electrons, so there can’t be more than eight dots per atom.
Q:
Carbon (C) has four valence electrons.
What does an electron dot diagram for this element look like?
A:
An electron dot diagram for carbon looks like this:
Valence Electrons and the Periodic Table
The number of valence electrons in an atom is reflected by its position in the periodic table of the elements (see the periodic table in the Figure below ).
Across each row, or period, of the periodic table, the number of valence electrons in groups 1–2 and 13–18 increases by one from one element to the next.
Within each column, or group, of the table, all the elements have the same number of valence electrons.
This explains why all the elements in the same group have very similar chemical properties.
The periodic table
For elements in groups 1–2 and 13–18, the number of valence electrons is easy to tell directly from the periodic table.
This is illustrated in the simplified periodic table in the Figure below .
