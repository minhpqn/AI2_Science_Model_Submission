This gives her potential energy.
Gravitational Potential Energy
Potential energy due to the position of an object above Earth’s surface is called gravitational potential energy.
Like the diver on the diving board, anything that is raised up above Earth’s surface has the potential to fall because of gravity.
You can see another example of people with gravitational potential energy in the Figure below .
You can also watch a cartoon introduction to gravitational potential energy by playing video #10 at this URL:
Both the sled and the gymnast have gravitational potential energy
Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s weight and its height above the ground.
It can be calculated with the equation:
Gravitational potential energy (GPE) = weight × height
Consider the little girl on the sled, pictured in the Figure above .
She weighs 140 Newtons, and the top of the hill is 4 meters higher than the bottom of the hill.
As she sits at the top of the hill, the child’s gravitational potential energy is:
GPE = 140 N × 4 m = 560 N • m
Notice that the answer is given in Newton • meters (N • m), which is the SI unit for energy.
A Newton ∙ meter is the energy needed to move a weight of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter.
A Newton • meter is also called a joule (J).
Q:
The gymnast on the balance beam pictured in the Figure above weighs 360 Newtons.
If the balance beam is 1.2 meters above the ground, what is the gymnast’s gravitational potential energy?
