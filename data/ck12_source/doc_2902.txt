Summarize the importance of Gregor Mendel to genetics.
Distinguish between self-pollination and cross-pollination.
Describe Mendel's first genetics experiments.
Why do you look like your family?
For a long time people understood that traits are passed down through families.
The rules of how this worked were unclear, however.
The work of Gregor Mendel was crucial in explaining how traits are passed down to each generation.
What does the word "inherit" mean?
You may have inherited something of value from a grandparent or another family member.
To inherit is to receive something from someone who came before you.
You can inherit objects, but you can also inherit traits.
For example, you can inherit a parent's eye color, hair color, or even the shape of your nose and ears!
Genetics is the study of inheritance.
The field of genetics seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next.
In the late 1850s, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel ( Figure below ) performed the first genetics experiments.
