Process to potentially cure genetic disorders; involves inserting normal genes into cells with mutant genes.
genetic counselor :
An individual trained in human genetics and counseling.
karyotype :
Depicts, usually in a photograph, the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any large chromosomal abnormalities; usually taken during metaphase of mitosis.
prenatal diagnosis :
The diagnosis of a disease or condition before a baby is born.
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency :
A heritable immunodeficiency; a genetic disorder that cripples the immune system;
SCID.
vector :
A carrier tool used in genetic engineering to transfer DNA into a target cell; an organism or an object that does not cause disease itself but which spreads infection by spreading pathogens from one host to another; a carrier that is used to deliver DNA to the correct location during gene therapy; often non-functional viral DNA.
Prenatal diagnosis refers to the diagnosis of a disease or condition before the baby is born.
Amniocentesis and choronic villus sampling are invasive methods involved in prenatal diagnosis.
Gene therapy is the insertion of a new gene into an individualâ€™s cells and tissues to treat a disease, replacing a mutant disease-causing allele with a normal, non-mutant allele.
