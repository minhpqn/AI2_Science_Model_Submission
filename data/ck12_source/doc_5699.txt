stationary state:
Electrons orbit at fixed distance from the nucleus.

List the electron transition lines according to energy levels.
Explain the presence of emission lines and relate them to electron transitions
Man fixing car engine
Can you fix a car engine?
It’s not as common any more, but there was a time when many people could work on their own cars if there was a problem.
Today, engines are computerized and require specialized training and tools in order to be fixed.
When people did their own repairs, it was sometimes a trial and error process.
Maybe the parks plugs needed to be replaced.
No, that didn’t fix the problem completely, but it was a start in the right direction.
Science operates the same way.
A theory that is developed may work for a while, but then there are data that the theory cannot explain.
This means that it's time for a newer and more inclusive theory.
Spectral Lines of Hydrogen
Bohr’s model explains the spectral lines of the hydrogen atomic emission spectrum.
While the electron of the atom remains in the ground state, its energy is unchanged.
When the atom absorbs one or more quanta of energy, the electron moves from the ground state orbit to an excited state orbit that is further away.
Energy levels are designated with the variable n .
