This rock has undergone shearing.
The pencil is pointing to a line.
Stresses forced rock on either side of that line to go in opposite directions.
Responses to Stress
The amount of stress on a rock may be greater than the rockâ€™s strength.
In that case, the rock will undergo strain or deformation ( Figure below ).
Deep within the Earth, the pressure is very great.
A rock behaves like a stretched rubber band.
When the stress stops, the rock goes back to its original shape.
If more stress is applied to the rock, it bends and flows.
It does not return to its original shape.
Near the surface, if the stress continues, the rock will fracture (rupture) and break.
Graph of stress, going from elastic deformation to plastic deformation to fracture
With increasing stress, the rock undergoes: (1) elastic deformation, (2) plastic deformation, and (3) fracture.
Stress is the force applied to an object.
Stresses can be confining, compression, tension, or shear.
Rocks under stress may show strain or deformation.
Deformation can be elastic or plastic, or the rock may fracture.
Rocks respond to stress differently under different conditions.
