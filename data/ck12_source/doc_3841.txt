Many important animal adaptations evolved in invertebrates.
Without these adaptations, vertebrates would not have been able to evolve.
They include:
Tissues, organs, and organ systems.
A symmetrical body.
A brain and sensory organs.
A fluid-filled body cavity.
A complete digestive system.
A body divided into segments.
Moving from Water to Land
When you think of the first animals to colonize the land, you may think of amphibians.
Itâ€™s true that ancestors of amphibians were the first vertebrates to move to land.
However, the very first animals to go ashore were invertebrates, most likely arthropods.
The move to land required new adaptations.
For example, animals needed a way to keep their body from drying out.
They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water.
One way early arthropods solved these problems was by evolving an exoskeleton.
This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside of the body.
It supports the body and helps retain water.
The ability to breath oxygen without gills was another necessary adaptation.
