This concept is known as the germ theory of disease, one of the few scientific theories in the field of the life sciences.
Although it seems obvious now, people did not always understand the cause of disease.

Scientific Evidence and Theories
One goal of a scientist is to find answers to scientific questions.
To do this, scientists first develop a hypothesis , which is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation.
To collect evidence to support (or disprove) their hypothesis, scientists must do experiments.
Evidence is:
A direct, physical observation of something or a process over time.
Usually something measurable or "quantifiable."
The data resulting from an experiment.
For example, an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of the law of gravity.
