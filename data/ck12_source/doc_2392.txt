Do you think this water molecule model satisfies the criteria of a useful model?
In other words, does it represent a real water molecule in important ways while being simpler and easier to understand than a real water molecule?
A:
The model shows the basic structure of a water molecule and how the atoms in the molecule share electrons.
These features of the water molecule explain important properties of water.
The model is also simpler and easier to understand than a real water molecule.
In a real molecule, electrons spin around the nuclei at the center of the atoms in a cloud, rather than in neat, circular orbits, as shown in the model.
The atoms of a real water molecule also contain even smaller particles than protons, neutrons, and electrons.
For many purposes, however, it’s not necessary to represent these more complex features of a real water molecule.
The diagram below shows another example of a simple model in physical science.
This diagram is a model of an electric circuit.
It represents the main parts of the circuit with simple symbols.
Horizontal lines with + and – signs represent a battery.
The parts labeled R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are devices that use electricity provided by the battery.
For example, these parts might be a series of three light bulbs.
Q:
In the electric circuit diagram, what do the black lines connecting the battery and electric devices represent?
A:
The black lines represent electric wires.
The wires are necessary to carry electric current from the battery to the electric devices and back to the battery again.
