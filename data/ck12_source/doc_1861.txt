How do horns form?
Why do glacial striations show the direction a glacier moved?
Describe how these erosional features form: hanging valley, cirque, arete, and horn.
How does plucking create a U-shaped valley?
Deposition by Glaciers
Describe the erosional landforms created by glaciers.
Describe the depositional landforms created by glaciers.
How could those rocks on the glacier modify the landscape?
Glaciers modify the landscape by erosion.
They also modify the landscape by deposition.
Glaciers carry an enormous amount of material and dump it.
The features they leave behind show where they were and what happened as they were melting away.
Deposition by Glaciers
As glaciers flow, mechanical weathering loosens rocks on the valley walls.
These rocks falls onto the glacier.
Glaciers can carry rocks of any size, from giant boulders to silt.
The glacier may carry the rocks for many kilometers over many years.
Glaciers deposit the sediment when they melt.
They drop and leave behind whatever was once frozen in their ice.
Giant rocks carried by a glacier are eventually dropped.
