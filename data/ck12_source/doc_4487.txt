Contractions of smooth muscle are involuntary.
This means they are not under conscious control.
Muscle tissue that is attached to bone is skeletal muscle .
Whether you are blinking your eyes or running a marathon, you are using skeletal muscle.
Contractions of skeletal muscle are voluntary, or under conscious control.
When skeletal muscle contracts, bones move.
Skeletal muscle is the most common type of muscle in the human body.
Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart.
When cardiac muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood.
Cardiac muscle contains a great many mitochondria, which produce ATP for energy.
This helps the heart resist fatigue.
Contractions of cardiac muscle are involuntary, like those of smooth muscle.
Cardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is arranged in bundles, so it appears striated , or striped.
There are three types of human muscle tissue: smooth muscle (in internal organs), skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle (only in the heart).
