Distinguish a tissue from an organ from an organ system.
Why be organized?
It can be said organization leads to efficiency.
And in you, cells are organized into tissues, which are organized into organs, which are organized into organ systems, which form you.
And it can be said that the human body is a very organized and efficient system.
Organization of Cells
Biological organization exists at all levels in organisms.
It can be seen at the smallest level, in the molecules that made up such things as DNA and proteins, to the largest level, in an organism such as a blue whale, the largest mammal on Earth.
Similarly, single celled prokaryotes and eukaryotes show order in the way their cells are arranged.
Single-celled organisms such as an amoeba are free-floating and independent-living.
Their single-celled "bodies" are able to carry out all the processes of life, such as metabolism and respiration, without help from other cells.
Some single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, can group together and form a biofilm.
A biofilm is a large grouping of many bacteria that sticks to a surface and makes a protective coating over itself.
Biofilms can show similarities to multicellular organisms.
Division of labor is the process in which one group of cells does one job (such as making the "glue" that sticks the biofilm to the surface), while another group of cells does another job (such as taking in nutrients).
Multicellular organisms carry out their life processes through division of labor.
They have specialized cells that do specific jobs.
However, biofilms are not considered multicellular organisms and are instead called colonial organisms.
The difference between a multicellular organism and a colonial organism is that individual organisms from a colony or biofilm can, if separated, survive on their own, while cells from a multicellular organism (e.g., liver cells) cannot.
