The energy for these processes come from an electrochemical gradient.
In such a gradient, one of the two substances is transported in the direction of their concentration gradient,and the energy derived is used to transport the second substance against its concentration gradient.
Thus, energy stored in the electrochemical gradient of an ion is used to drive the transport of another solute against a concentration or electrochemical gradient.
In antiport, one substance moves along its electrochemical gradient, allowing a different substance to move against its own electrochemical gradient.
This movement is in contrast to primary active transport, in which all solutes are moved against their concentration gradients, fueled by ATP.
In symport, one substance moves down the electrochemical gradient, allowing the other molecule(s) to move against its concentration gradient.
One substance moves by facilitated diffusion, which is coupled with the active transport of the other substance.
active transport :
Transport of molecules and ions across membranes against a concentration gradient; requires energy.
antiport :
The secondary active transport process of transporting two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in opposite directions.
antiporter :
An integral membrane protein involved in secondary active transport; transports two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in opposite directions.
ATPase :
A class of enzymes that catalyze the decomposition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a free phosphate ion.
cotransport :
The simultaneous or sequential transport of more than one molecule or ion across biological membranes; also known as secondary active transport.
electrochemical gradient :
Difference across a membrane due to both a chemical force and an electrical force; drives the movement of ions across the membrane.
primary active transport :
