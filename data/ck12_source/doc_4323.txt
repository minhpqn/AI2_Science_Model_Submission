Where do echinoderms live?
How are echinoderms distinct from other invertebrates?
Describe the water vascular system.
What are ossicles?
Compare the Pelmatozoa to the Eleutherozoa.
Describe the echinoderm endoskeleton.
Give an example of an organism in each class of living echinoderms.
Adult sea stars and other echinoderms have obvious radial symmetry.
What evidence supports the claim that echinoderms evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry?
Explain the structure and function of the water vascular system.
Describe the two subphyla of invertebrate chordates.
Distinguish between tunicates and lancelets.
Would you believe this animal eats its own brain?
This is a sea squirt, which is a tunicate.
Many physical changes occur to the tunicate's body during metamorphosis into an adult, with one of the most interesting being the digestion of the cerebral ganglion, which controls movement and is the equivalent of the human brain.
From this comes the common saying that the sea squirt "eats its own brain."
Living species of chordates are classified into three major subphyla:
Vertebrata, Urochordata, and Cephalochordata.
Vertebrates are all chordates that have a backbone.
The other two subphyla are invertebrate chordates that lack a backbone.
