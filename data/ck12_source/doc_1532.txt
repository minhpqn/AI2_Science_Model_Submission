Can you identify the bottom of the stratosphere in the photo?
It's where the clouds begin.
Remember that all weather is in the troposphere.
The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere.
The layer rises to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the surface.
Temperature in the Stratosphere
Air temperature in the stratosphere increases with altitude.
Why?
The stratosphere gets most of its heat from the Sun.
Therefore, it’s warmer closer to the Sun.
The air at the bottom of the stratosphere is cold.
The cold air is dense, so it doesn’t rise.
As a result, there is little mixing of air in this layer.
The Ozone Layer
The previous section said that the troposphere is the most important layer of the atmosphere.
But it's not the only important layer.
The stratosphere contains a layer of ozone gas.
Ozone consists of three oxygen atoms (O 3 ).
The ozone layer is in the stratosphere.
Ozone in the layer absorbs high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
