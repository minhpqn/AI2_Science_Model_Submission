Water and Life - Advanced
Explain why water is essential for life processes.
Describe various biochemical reactions involving water.
Condensation.
Just in clouds?
Condensation occurs in your cells constantly.
It occurs in the form of a chemical reaction.
These condensation reactions involve the formation of a water molecule from two other molecules.
Water forms when two molecules, such as amino acids or monosaccharides, are joined together.
The amino acids join together to form peptides (or polypeptides or proteins) and the monosaccharides join together to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.
Water and Life
Humans are composed of about 60-70 percent water (not counting water in body fat).
This water is crucial for normal functioning of the body.
Water’s ability to dissolve most biologically significant compounds—from inorganic salts to large organic molecules—makes it a vital solvent inside organisms and cells.
Water is an essential part of most metabolic processes within organisms.
Metabolism is the sum total of all body reactions, including those that build up molecules ( anabolic reactions ) and those that break down molecules ( catabolic reactions ).
In anabolic reactions, water is generally removed from small molecules in order to make larger molecules.
In catabolic reactions, water is used to break bonds in larger molecules in order to make smaller molecules.
Water is central to two related, fundamental metabolic reactions in organisms: photosynthesis and cellular respiration .
All organisms depend directly or indirectly on these two reactions.
