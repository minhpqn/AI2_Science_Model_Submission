Remember that Newton's 3^{rd} Law, calling for “equal and opposite forces,” does not apply to a single object.
None of your forces should be “equal and opposite” on the same object in the sense of Newton's 3^{rd} Law.
Third law pairs act on two different objects.
Recall that scales (like a bathroom scale you weigh yourself on) read out the normal force acting on you, not your weight.
If you are at rest on the scale, the normal force equals your weight.
If you are accelerating up or down, the normal force had better be higher or lower than your weight, or you won’t have an unbalanced force to accelerate you.
Never include “m a ” as a force acting on an object. “m a ” is the result of the net force F_{net} which is found by summing all the forces acting on your object of interest.
Determine how to orient your axes
A good rule to generally follow is that you want one axis (usually the x-axis) to be parallel to the surface your object of interest is sitting on.
If your object is on a ramp, tilt your axes so that the x-axis is parallel to the incline and the y-axis is perpendicular.
In this case, this will force you to break the force of gravity on the object into its components.
But by tilting your axes, you will generally have to break up fewer vectors, making the whole problem simpler.
Identify which forces are in the  x- direction, which are in the y- direction, and which are at an angle.
If a force is upward, make it in the y- direction and give it a positive sign.
If it is downward, make it in the y- direction and give it a negative sign.
Same thing applies for right vs. left in the x- direction.
Make rightward forces positive.
If forces are at an angle, draw them at an angle.
A great example is that when a dog on a leash runs ahead, pulling you along, it’s pulling both forward and down on your hand.
