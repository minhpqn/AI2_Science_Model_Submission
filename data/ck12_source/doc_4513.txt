The sensory division of the PNS carries sensory information from the body to the central nervous system.
The motor division of the PNS carries nerve impulses from the central nervous system to muscles and glands throughout the body.
The nerve impulses stimulate muscles to contract and glands to secrete hormones.
The motor division of the peripheral nervous system is further divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.
Detailed illustration of the nervous system
The nerves of the peripheral nervous system are shown in blue in this image.
Can you identify the sciatic nerve?
Somatic Nervous System
The somatic nervous system (SNS) controls mainly voluntary activities that are under conscious control.
It is made up of nerves that are connected to skeletal muscles.
Whenever you perform a conscious movement, from signing your name to riding your bike, your somatic nervous system is responsible.
The somatic nervous system also controls some unconscious movements, called reflexes.
A reflex is a very rapid motor response that is not directed by the brain.
In a reflex, nerve impulses travel to and from the spinal cord in a reflex arc , like the one in Figure below .
In this example, the person jerks his hand away from the flame without any conscious thought.
It happens unconsciously because the nerve impulses bypass the brain.
Reflex arc mechanism
A reflex arc like this one enables involuntary actions.
How might reflex responses be beneficial to the organism?
Autonomic Nervous System
