This causes the cell to burst, destroying both the cell and the viruses inside it.

Cytotoxic T cell mechanism
A cytotoxic T cell releases toxins that destroy an infected body cell and the viruses it contains.
After an infection has been brought under control, most cytotoxic T cells die off.
However, a few remain as memory cells.
If the same pathogen enters the body again, the memory cells mount a rapid immune response.
They quickly produce many copies of cytotoxic T cells specific to the antigen of that pathogen.
Regulatory T Cells
Regulatory T cells are responsible for ending the cell-mediated immune response after an infection has been curbed.
They also suppress T cells that mistakenly react against self antigens.
What might happen if these T cells were not suppressed?
Activated T cells destroy certain cancer cells and cells infected by viruses.
Memory T cells remain in the body after the immune response and provide antigen-specific immunity to the virus.
