They have three embryonic cell layers, including mesoderm.
The mesoderm layer allows them to develop organ systems.
For example, they have muscular and excretory systems.
The muscular system allows them to move from place to place over solid surfaces.
The excretory system lets them maintain a proper balance of water and salts.
Flatworms also show cephalization and bilateral symmetry.
Flatworms reproduce sexually.
In most species, the same individuals produce both eggs and sperm.
After fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs pass out of the adult’s body and hatch into larvae.
There may be several different larval stages.
The final larval stage develops into the adult form, and the life cycle repeats.
Ecology of Flatworms
Both flukes and tapeworms are parasites with vertebrate hosts, including human hosts.
Flukes live in the host’s circulatory system or liver.
Tapeworms live in the host’s digestive system.
Usually, more than one type of host is required to complete the parasite’s life cycle.
Look at the life cycle of the liver fluke in Figure below .
As an adult, the fluke has a vertebrate host.
As a larva, it has an invertebrate host.
If you follow the life cycle, you can see how each host becomes infected so the fluke can continue its life cycle.
