Matching Rock Layers
When rock layers are in the same place, itâ€™s easy to give them relative ages.
But what if rock layers are far apart?
What if they are on different continents?
What evidence is used to match rock layers in different places?
Widespread Rock Layers
Some rock layers extend over a very wide area.
They may be found on more than one continent or in more than one country.
They are matched up by correlation .
For example, the famous White Cliffs of Dover are on the coast of southeastern England.
These distinctive rocks are matched by similar white cliffs in France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Denmark ( Figure below ).
It is important that this chalk layer goes across the English Channel.
The rock is so soft that the Channel Tunnel connecting England and France was carved into it!

Like index fossils, key beds are used to match rock layers.
A key bed is a thin layer of rock.
The rock must be unique and widespread.
For example, a key bed from around the time that the dinosaurs went extinct is very important.
