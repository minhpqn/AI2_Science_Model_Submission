As they lack vascular tissue, they also do not have true roots, stems, or leaves.
Nonvascular plants do often have a “leafy” appearance, though, and they can have stem-like and root-like structures.
These plants are very short because they cannot move nutrients and water up a stem.
Nonvascular seedless plants, also known as bryophytes , are classified into three phyla:
Mosses are most often recognized as the green “fuzz” on damp rocks and trees in a forest.
If you look closely, you will see that most mosses have tiny stem-like and leaf-like structures.
This is the gametophyte stage.
Remember that a gametophyte is haploid, having only one set of chromosomes.
The gametophyte produces the gametes that, after fertilization, develop into the diploid sporophyte with two sets of chromosomes.
The sporophyte forms a capsule, called the sporangium , which releases spores ( Figure below ).

Notice that both the sporophytes and gametophytes exist at the same time.
Hornworts are named for their appearance.
The "horn" part of the name comes from their hornlike sporophytes, and “wort” comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for herb.
The hornlike sporophytes grow from a base of flattened lobes, which are the gametophytes ( Figure below ).
They usually grow in moist and humid areas.
In hornworts, the horns are the sporophytes that rise up from the leaflike gametophyte
In hornworts, the “horns” are the sporophytes that rise up from the leaflike gametophyte.
Liverworts have two distinct appearances: they can either be leafy like mosses or flattened and ribbon-like.
