temperature:
A measurement of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in an object or system and can be measured with a thermometer or a calorimeter.
conduction:  The transfer of thermal energy by the movement of particles that are in contact with each other.
absolute zero:  The lowest possible temperature, at which point the atoms of a substance transmit no thermal energy - they are completely at rest.
It is 0 degrees on the Kelvin scale, which translates to -273.15 degrees Celsius (or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit).
Define specific heat.
Calculate heat transfer.

Underground water is heated by the earth’s molten core and, when sufficient pressure is built up, the water shoots out of the ground in an amazing display.
When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature.
The amount of temperature increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made.
When you add the same amount of heat to the same mass of different substances, the amount of temperature increase is different.
Each substance has a specific heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit.
In the SI system, specific heat is measured in J/kg•K. (Occasionally, you may also see specific heat expressed sometimes in J/g•K).
The specific heat of aluminum is 903 J/kg•K.
Therefore, it requires 903 J to raise 1.00 kg of aluminum by 1.00 K.

Specific Heat (J/kg•K)
The amount of heat gained or lost by an object when its temperature changes can be calculated by the formula
