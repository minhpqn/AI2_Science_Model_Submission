When it is visible, it is the brightest object in the night sky besides the Moon and Venus.
Jupiter is quite far from Earth.
The planet is more than five times as far from Earth as the Sun.
It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth years to orbit once around the Sun.
A Ball of Gas and Liquid
Since Jupiter is a gas giant, could a spacecraft land on its surface?
The answer is no.
There is no solid surface at all!
Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of other elements.
The outer layers of the planet are gas.
Deeper within the planet, the intense pressure condenses the gases into a liquid.
Jupiter may have a small rocky core at its center.
A Stormy Atmosphere
Jupiter's atmosphere is unlike any other in the solar system!
The upper layer contains clouds of ammonia.
The ammonia is different colored bands.
These bands rotate around the planet.
The ammonia also swirls around in tremendous storms.
The Great Red Spot ( Figure below ) is Jupiter's most noticeable feature.
The spot is an enormous, oval-shaped storm.
