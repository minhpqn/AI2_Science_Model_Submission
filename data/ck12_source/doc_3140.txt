Compare and contrast thermal energy and temperature.
Explain how an object with a higher temperature can have less thermal energy than an object with a lower temperature.
Explain how temperature is measured and how a thermometer works.
Describe three temperature scales, and show how to convert temperatures from one scale to another.
This boy has a fever, and it makes him feel miserable.
He feels achy and really tired.
He also feels hot because his temperature is higher than normal.
He has a thermometer in his mouth to measure his temperature.
What Is Temperature?
No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is.
You might say that itâ€™s how warm or cool something feels.
In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter.
When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher.
With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer.
When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower.
With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.
How a Thermometer Measures Temperature
Many thermometers measure temperature with a liquid that expands when it gets warmer and contracts when it gets cooler.
Look at the common household thermometer pictured in the Figure below .
The red liquid rises or falls in the glass tube as the temperature changes.
