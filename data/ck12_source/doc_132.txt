They live in the ocean, fly in the sky, walk on the prairies, and run in the savanna.
There is a tremendous amount of diversity within the group in terms of reproduction, habitat, and adaptation for living in those different habitats.
What allows them to live in such diverse environments?
They have evolved specialized traits, unlike those of any other group of animal.
Mammals (class Mammalia) are endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrate animals with a number of unique characteristics.
In most mammals, these include:
The presence of hair or fur.
Glands specialized to produce milk, known as mammary glands .
Three middle ear bones.
A neocortex region in the brain, which specializes in seeing and hearing.
A four-chambered heart.
There are approximately 5,400 mammalian species, ranging in size from the tiny 1-2 inch bumblebee bat to the 108-foot blue whale.
These are distributed in 29 orders, 153 families, and about 1,200 genera.
There are three types of mammals, characterized by their method of reproduction.
All mammals, except for a few, are viviparous , meaning they produce live young instead of laying eggs.
The monotremes , however, have birdlike and reptilian characteristics, such as laying eggs and a cloaca.
An example of a monotreme is the platypus with its birdlike beak and egg-laying characteristics.
The echidnas are the only other monotreme mammals.
A second type of mammal, the marsupial mammal, includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and possums.
These mammals give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mother's body, where it feeds and continues to grow.
