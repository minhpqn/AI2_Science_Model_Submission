a sugar, which is deoxyribose (C 5 H 8 O 4 ) in DNA and ribose (C 5 H 10 O 5 ) in RNA.
one of four nitrogen-containing bases. (A base is a compound that is not neither acidic nor neutral.) In DNA, the bases are adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine.
RNA has the base uracil instead of thymine, but the other three bases are the same.
Parts of a nucleotide
The Double Helix
RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides.
DNA consists of two chains.
Nitrogen bases on the two chains of DNA form hydrogen bonds with each other.
Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak bonds that form between a positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule and a negatively charged atom in another molecule.
Hydrogen bonds form only between adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine.
These bonds hold the two chains together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape.
You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in the Figure below .
Sugars and phosphate groups form the “backbone” of each chain of DNA.
The bonded bases are called base pairs.
Determining the structure of DNA was a huge scientific breakthrough.
You can read the interesting story of its discovery and why it was so important at the URL below.
Structure of DNA
Q:
Compare the structure of DNA to a spiral staircase.
What part of the molecule do the stair steps represent?
