Look closely at equation 1.
There’s something wrong with it.
Do you see what it is?
A:
All chemical equations must be balanced.
This means that there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow.
That’s because mass is always conserved in chemical reactions.
Count the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms on each side of the arrow.
There are two hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products.
There are two oxygen atoms in the reactants but only one in the product.
Therefore, equation 1 is not balanced.
Coefficients are used to balance chemical equations.
A coefficient is a number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula.
It shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction.
For example, two molecules of hydrogen would be written as 2 H 2 , and two molecules of water would be written 2 H 2 O.
A coefficient of 1 usually isn’t written.
Coefficients can be used to balance equation 1 (above) as follows:
2 H 2 + O 2 → 2 H 2 O
Equation 2 shows that two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to produce two molecules of water.
The two molecules of hydrogen each contain two hydrogen atoms and so do the two molecules of water.
