In this article, you’ll find out.
You can also watch a video introduction to magnets at this URL:
A magnet is an object that attracts certain materials such as iron.
You’re probably familiar with common bar magnets, like the one shown in the Figure below .
Like all magnets, this bar magnet has north and south magnetic poles .
The red end of the magnet is the north pole and the blue end is the south pole.
The poles are regions where the magnet is strongest.
The poles are called north and south because they always line up with Earth’s north-south axis if the magnet is allowed to move freely. (Earth’s axis is the imaginary line around which the planet rotates.)
Q:
What do you suppose would happen if you cut the bar magnet pictured in the Figure above along the line between the north and south poles?
A:
Both halves of the magnet would also have north and south poles.
If you cut each of the halves in half, all those pieces would have north and south poles as well.
Pieces of a magnet always have both north and south poles no matter how many times you cut the magnet.
Magnetic Force and Magnetic Field
The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials, including other magnets, is called magnetic force .
The force is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion.
North and south poles of two magnets attract each other, while two north poles or two south poles repel each other.
A magnet can exert force over a distance because the magnet is surrounded by a magnetic field .
In the Figure below , you can see the magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet.
