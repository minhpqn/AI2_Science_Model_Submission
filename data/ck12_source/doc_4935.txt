Describe the importance of cell transport.
What is cell transport?
It is the movement of substances across the cell membrane either into or out of the cell.
Sometimes things just move through the phospholipid bilayer.
Other times, substances need the assistance of a protein, like a channel protein or some other transmembrane protein, to cross the cell membrane.
Cell transport refers to the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
Probably the most important feature of a cellâ€™s phospholipid membranes is that they are selectively permeable.
A membrane that is selectively permeable , or semipermeable, has control over what molecules or ions can enter or leave the cell, as shown in Figure below .
This feature allows a cell to control the transport of materials, as dictated by the cell's function.
The permeability of a membrane is dependent on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins.
In this way, cell membranes help maintain a state of homeostasis within cells (and tissues, organs, and organ systems) so that an organism can stay alive and healthy.
A selectively permeable, or semipermeable, membrane allows certain molecules through, but not others.
Transport Across Membranes
The molecular make-up of the phospholipid bilayer limits the types of molecules that can pass through it.
For example, hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ), can easily pass through the lipid bilayer, but ions such as calcium (Ca 2+ ) and polar molecules such as water (H 2 O) cannot.
The hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer does not allow ions or polar molecules through because they are hydrophilic, or water loving.
In addition, large molecules such as sugars and proteins are too big to pass through the phospholipid bilayer.
