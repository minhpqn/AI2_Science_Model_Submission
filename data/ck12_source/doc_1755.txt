Dinosaurs thrived during one of the warmest periods in Earth's history.
But ice ages also occurred many times in the past.
An ice age is a period when temperatures are cooler than normal.
This causes glaciers to spread to lower latitudes.
Scientists think that ice ages occurred at least six times over the last billion years alone.
How do scientists learn about Earth’s past climates?
The last major ice age took place in the Pleistocene.
This epoch lasted from 2 million to 14,000 years ago.
Earth’s temperature was only 5° C (9° F) cooler than it is today.
But glaciers covered much of the Northern Hemisphere.
Below, you can see how far south they went ( Figure below ).
Clearly, a small change in temperature can have a big impact on the planet.
Humans lived during this ice age.
Map showing how much land the Pleistocene glaciers covered
Pleistocene glaciers covered an enormous land area.
Chicago is just one city that couldn't have existed during the Pleistocene.
Why Climate Changes
Several natural processes may affect Earth’s temperature.
They range from sunspots to Earth’s wobble.
Sunspots are storms on the Sun.
