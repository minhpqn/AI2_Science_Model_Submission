The entire ribosome complex moves along the mRNA, sending the first tRNA into the E site and the tRNA with the growing polypeptide into the P site.
The A site is now empty and ready to accept another tRNA.
The first tRNA now leaves the ribosome.
The A site accepts a tRNA with an attached amino acid, a peptide bond forms between the two adjacent amino acids, and the process continues.
Termination of translation occurs when the ribosome comes to one of the three stop codons, for which there is no tRNA.
At this point, a protein called a release factor binds to the A site.
The release factor causes the addition of a water molecule to the polypeptide chain, resulting in the release of the completed chain from the tRNA and ribosome.
The ribosome, release factor, and tRNAs then dissociate and translation is complete.
The process of translation is summarized in Figure below .
Summary of translation.
Notice the mRNA segment within the ribosome.
A tRNA anticodon binds to the appropriate codon, bringing the corresponding amino acid into the ribosome where it can be added to the growing polypeptide chain.
Post-Translational Modification and Protein Folding
The events following protein synthesis often include post-translational modification of the peptide chain and folding of the protein into its functional conformation.
During and after synthesis, polypeptide chains often fold into secondary and then tertiary structures.
These levels of organization were discussed in the Organic Compounds:
Proteins (Advanced) concept.
Briefly, the primary structure of the protein is the sequence of amino acids determined by the gene and mRNA.
The secondary and tertiary structures are determined by interactions between the amino acids within the polypeptide ( Figure below ).
Many proteins undergo post-translational modification, allowing them to then perform their specific function.
