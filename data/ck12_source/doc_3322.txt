A closed loop through which current can flow is called an electric circuit .
In homes in the U.S., most electric circuits have a voltage of 120 volts.
The amount of current (amps) a circuit carries depends on the number and power of electrical devices connected to the circuit.
Home circuits generally have a safe upper limit of about 20 or 30 amps.
Parts of an Electric Circuit
All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor.
They may have other parts as well, such as light bulbs and switches, as in the simple circuit seen in the Figure below .

A properly closed circuit
The voltage source of this simple circuit is a battery.
In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to many communities.
The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires.
The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again.
In the Figure above , the wires are connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a closed loop.
Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert electrical energy to other forms of energy.
In the case of a light bulb, electrical energy is converted to light and thermal energy.
Many circuits have switches to control the flow of current.
When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow through it.
When the switch is turned off, the circuit is open and current cannot flow through it.
When a contractor builds a new home, she uses a set of plans called blueprints that show her how to build the house.
