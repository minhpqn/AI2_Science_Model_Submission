Active transport is the energy-requiring process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes against a concentration gradient.
Active transport processes help maintain homeostasis.

What is active transport?
Explain how cell transport helps an organism maintain homeostasis.
Describe the function of the sodium-potassium pump.
Explain the membrane potential and the electrochemical gradient.
What is this incredible object?
Would it surprise you to learn that it is a human cell?
The image represents an active human nerve cell.
How nerve cells function will be the focus of another concept.
However, active transport processes play a significant role in the function of these cells.
Specifically, it is the sodium-potassium pump that is active in the axons of these nerve cells.
