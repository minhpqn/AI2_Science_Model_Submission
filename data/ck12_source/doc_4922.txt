In addition to holding cells together, tight junctions play a role in the transport of materials.
Tight junctions prevent the passage of molecules and ions through the space between cells.
So these molecules and ions must actually enter cells (either by diffusion or active transport) in order to proceed through a tissue.
This allows tight junctions to indirectly play a role over what substances are allowed into a specific cell.
Tight junctions play this role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier.
centriole :
A cylindrical shaped cell structure composed of nine triplets of microtubules; structure from which spindle fibers originate.
centrosome :
An organelle that serves as the main microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of the animal cell.
connexon :
An assembly of six connexin proteins; part of a gap junction channel between the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells.
desmosome :
A junctional complex cell structure specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion.
gap junction :
A specialized intercellular connection between a various animal cell-types; directly connects the cytoplasm of two cells; the narrow gap between the pre- and post-synaptic cells in electrical synapses.
microtubule organizing center (MTOC) :
A structure found in eukaryotic cells from which microtubules emerge.
plasmodesmata :
Microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells; enables transport and communication between them.
tight junction :
