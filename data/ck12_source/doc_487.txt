Lenses are used to correct vision problems.
Two of the most common vision problems are myopia and hyperopia.
Myopia is also called nearsightedness.
It affects about one third of people.
People with myopia can see nearby objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry.
The picture below shows how a person with myopia might see two boys that are a few meters away ( Figure below ).
This diagram illustrates how a person with myopia sees an image
On the left, you can see how a person with normal vision sees two boys.
The right image shows how a person with myopia sees the boys.
In myopia, the eye is too long.
Below, you can see how images are focused on the retina of someone with myopia ( Figure below ).
Myopia is corrected with a concave lens, which curves inward like the inside of a bowl.
The lens changes the focus, so images fall on the retina as they should.
This illustrations shows how light rays are improperly focused in individuals with myopia and hyperopia
The eye of a person with myopia is longer than normal.
As a result, images are focused in front of the retina ( top left ).
A concave lens is used to correct myopia to help focus images on the retina ( top right ).
Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when objects are focused in back of the retina ( bottom left ).
It is corrected with a convex lens ( bottom right ).
