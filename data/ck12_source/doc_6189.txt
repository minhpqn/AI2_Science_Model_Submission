The moles of CaCl 2 is first calculated, followed by the molality of the solution.
The freezing and boiling points are then determined, including multiplying by 3 for the three ions.
Step 2:
Solve.
82.20 \text{ g CaCl}_2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mol CaCl}_2}{110.98 \text{ g CaCl}_2} &= 0.7407 \text{ mol CaCl}_2\\\frac{0.7407 \text{ mol CaCl}_2}{0.400 \text{ kg H}_2\text{O}} &= 1.85 \ m \ \text{CaCl}_2
\Delta T_f &= K_f \times m \times 3=-1.86^\circ \text{C}/m \times 1.85 \ m \times 3=-10.3^\circ \text{C} && T_f=-10.3^\circ \text{C}\\\Delta T_b &= K_b \times m \times 3=0.512^\circ \text{C}/m \times 1.85 \ m \times 3=2.84^\circ \text{C} && T_b=102.84^\circ \text{C}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Since the normal boiling point of water is 100.00Â°C, the calculated result for \Delta T_b  must be added to 100.00 to find the new boiling point.
The effect of ionization on colligative properties is described.
Do the practice and homework problems dealing with ionic solutions toward the end of the section on the link below:
Why do ionic materials change the colligative properties of a solution?
Would HCl be expected to alter colligative properties?
Calcium carbonate is ionic, but insoluble in water.
What effect would it have on the boiling point of water?
Calculating Molar Mass
Perform calculations for the determination of molar mass from changes in boiling or freezing points.
It is possible to calculate quantities like molecular weight from freezing point depression
How much antifreeze is needed?
We know that we can put antifreeze into a radiator and keep an engine from freezing up.
