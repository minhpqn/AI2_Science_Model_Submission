These 22 chromosomes occur in homologous pairs in a normal diploid cell, with one of each pair inherited from each parent.
The sex of an individual is determined by the sex chromosome within the male gamete.
Females are homologous, XX, for the sex chromosomes, whereas males are heterozygous, XY.
As all individuals inherit an X chromosome from their mother (females can only produce gametes with an X chromosome), it is the sex chromosome that they inherit from their father that determines their sex.
In terms of genetics, is the location of a gene or trait an important piece of information?
Does it make a difference if the gene is located on a sex chromosome or an autosome?
It might.
Autosomal-linked traits are due to genes on the autosomes; sex-linked traits are due to genes located on the sex chromosomes.
Simple Dominant Heredity
What is the difference between a trait and a genetic disorder ?
Could a disorder be considered a trait?
We tend to think of traits as hair color or skin color and disorders as something that is bad for you.
But in terms of genetics, a genetic disorder is a trait.
Both may be due to your genes.
Traits may be inherited in any of a number of ways: autosomal dominant or recessive, sex-linked inheritance, or a more complex pattern of inheritance.
How are traits due to genes on autosomes inherited?
Autosomal traits due to the effects of one gene are usually inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern.
That is, they can be either dominant or recessive.
In humans, whereas many genetic disorders are inherited in a recessive manner, simple dominant inheritance accounts for many of a personâ€™s physical characteristics, such as chin, earlobe, hairline and thumb shape.
For example, having earlobes that are attached to the head is a recessive trait, whereas heterozygous and homozygous dominant individuals have freely hanging earlobes.
