The filaments quickly burned out.
Although air was pumped out of the bulb, it wasn’t a complete vacuum.
Oxygen in the small amount of air remaining inside the light bulb reacted with the metal filament.
This corroded the filament and caused dark deposits on the glass.
Filling a light bulb with argon gas prevents these problems.
That’s why modern light bulbs are filled with argon.
Q:
How does argon prevent the problems of early light bulbs?
A:
As a noble gas with eight electrons, argon doesn’t react with the metal in the filament.
This protects the filament and keeps the glass blub free of deposits.
Argon is used in incandescent lightbulbs
Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below .
Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them.
When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level.
When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light.
Different noble gases give off light of different colors.
Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below.
Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.
Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table.
