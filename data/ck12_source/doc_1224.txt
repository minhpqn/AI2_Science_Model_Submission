Rocks and Processes of the Rock Cycle
Explain the processes of the rock cycle.
Is this what geologists mean by the rock cycle?
Okay, maybe not.
The rock cycle shows how any type of rock can become any other type of rock.
The three rock types are joined together by the processes that change one to another.
The Rock Cycle
You learned about the three rock types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
You also learned that all of these rocks can change.
In fact, any rock can change to become any other type of rock.
These changes usually happen very slowly.
Some changes happen below Earthâ€™s surface.
Some changes happen above ground.
These changes are all part of the rock cycle.
