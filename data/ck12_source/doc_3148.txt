Water in a lake always warms up in the summer more slowly than the adjacent land.
Use the concept of specific heat to explain why.
Define conduction and explain how it occurs.
Describe examples of conduction.
Yummy!
These cookies look delicious.
But watch out!
They just finished baking in a hot oven, so the cookie sheet is too hot to handle without an oven mitt.
Touching the cookie sheet with bare hands could cause a painful burn.
Do you know why?
The answer is conduction.
What Is Conduction?
Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching.
Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called heat.
Conduction is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred (the other ways are convection and thermal radiation).
Thermal energy is always transferred from matter with a higher temperature to matter with a lower temperature.
Pass It On
To understand how conduction works, you need to think about the tiny particles that make up matter.
The particles of all matter are in constant random motion, but the particles of warmer matter have more energy and move more quickly than the particles of cooler matter.
When particles of warmer matter collide with particles of cooler matter, they transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles.
