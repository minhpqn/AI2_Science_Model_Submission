What is the probability of cutting a deck of playing cards and getting an ace?
How can you determine the probability of two independent events that occur together?
What is the probability that two heterozygous individuals will have offspring with attached earlobes?
Define probability.
Apply the term to a coin toss.
How is gamete formation like tossing a coin?
With a BB homozygote, what is the chance of a gamete having the B allele?
The b allele?
Explain a Punnett square.
Describe how to use a Punnett square for a monohybrid and dihybrid cross.
Predict genotypes of parents and offspring using a Punnett square.
Determine phenotypes of offspring using a Punnett square.
What do you get when you cross an apple and an orange?
Though the above fruit may not result, it would be nice to scientifically predict what would result.
Predicting the possible genotypes and phenotypes from a genetic cross is often aided by a Punnett square.
A Punnett square is a chart that allows you to easily determine the expected percentage of different genotypes in the offspring of two parents.
An example of a Punnett square for pea plants is shown in Figure below .
In this example, both parents are heterozygous for flower color ( Bb ).
The gametes produced by the male parent are at the top of the chart, and the gametes produced by the female parent are along the side.
The different possible combinations of alleles in their offspring are determined by filling in the cells of the Punnett square with the correct letters (alleles).
