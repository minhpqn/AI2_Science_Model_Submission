Plants and animals weather material and produce soils.
In tropical regions, where temperature and precipitation are consistently high, thick soils form.
Arid regions have thin soils.
Soil type also influences the type of vegetation that can grow in the region.
We can identify climate types by the types of plants that grow there.
The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil.
Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller pieces.
Chemical reactions change the rock's minerals.
Soil may form in place or from material that has been moved.
Residual soil forms in place.
The underlying rock breaks down to form the layers of soil above it.
Only about one-third of the soils in the United States are residual.
Transported soil has come in from somewhere else.
Sediments can be transported into an area by glaciers, wind, water, or gravity.
Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported and deposited.
Weathered material washes off steep slopes and so does not stay in place to form soil.
Soil forms where land areas are flat or gently undulating.
Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases.
The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the thicker it will be.
Biological activity produces the organic material in soil.
