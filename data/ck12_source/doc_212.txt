Weight is measured in force units—newtons—by a calibrated spring scale as shown here.
The weight of an object is measured in Newtons with a calibrated spring scale
The force of gravity is given by Newton’s Second Law, F = ma , where F is the force of gravity in newtons, m is the mass of the object in kilograms, and a is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 m/s 2 .
When the formula is used specifically for finding weight from mass or vice versa, it may appear as W = mg .
Example Problem:
What is the weight of an object sitting on the Earth’s surface if the mass of the object is 43.7 kg?
Solution:
W = mg = (43.7 \ \text{kg})(9.81 \ \text{m/s}^2) = 429 \ \text{N}
Example Problem:
What is the mass of an object whose weight sitting on the Earth is 2570 N?
m=\frac{W}{a}=\frac{2570 \ \text{N}}{9.81 \ \text{m/s}^2}=262 \ \text{kg}
The mass of an object is measured in kilograms and is defined as the amount of matter in an object.
Mass is determined by comparing an object to known masses on a balance.
The weight of an object on the Earth is defined as the force acting on the object by the Earth’s gravity.
Weight is measured by a calibrated spring scale.
The formula relating mass and weight is W = mg .
