V_2=8.00 \ \text{L}
M_2=0.50 \ \text{M}
\text{volume stock} \ \text{HNO}_3 \ (V_1)=? \ \text{L}
The unknown in the equation is V_1 , the volume of the concentrated stock solution.
Step 2:
Solve.
V_1=\frac{M_2 \times V_2}{M_1}=\frac{0.50 \text{ M} \times 8.00 \text{ L}}{16 \text{ M}}=0.25 \text{ L}=250 \text{ mL}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
250 mL of the stock HNO 3 needs to be diluted with water to a final volume of 8.00 L.
The dilution is by a factor of 32 to go from 16 M to 0.5 M.
Dilutions can be performed in the laboratory with various tools, depending on the volumes required and the desired accuracy.
The following images illustrate the use of two different types of pipettes.
The images below illustrate the use of two different types of pipettes.
In the first figure ( Figure below ), a glass pipette is being used to transfer a portion of a solution to a graduated cylinder.
Use of a pipette rather than a graduated cylinder for the transfer improves accuracy.
The second figure ( Figure below ) shows a  micropipette , which is designed to quickly and accurately dispense small volumes.
Micropipettes are adjustable and come in a variety of sizes.
Glass pipettes are much more precise than graduated cylinders for measuring specific volumes
Micropipettes are used to precisely measure volumes under 1 mL
