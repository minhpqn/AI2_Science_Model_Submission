He overcame financial hardship and ill health to excel in school.
In 1843 he entered the Augustinian Abbey in Brünn (now Brno, Czech Republic.) Upon entering monastic life, he took the name Gregor.
While at the monastery, Mendel also attended lectures on the growing of fruit and agriculture at the Brünn Philosophical Institute.
In 1849 he accepted a teaching job, but a year later he failed the state teaching examination.
One of his examiners recommended that he be sent to university for further studies.
In 1851 he was sent to the University of Vienna to study natural science and mathematics.
Mendel’s time at Vienna was very important in his development as a scientist.
His professors encouraged him to learn science through experimentation and to use mathematics to help explain observations of natural events, which he did.
In fact, it was the use of math in his analysis that made his conclusions much more convincing.
Mendel's Pea Plants
In 1853 and 1854, Mendel published two papers on crop damage by insects.
However, he is best known for his later studies of the pea plant Pisum sativum .
Mendel was inspired by both his professors at university and his colleagues at the monastery to study variation in plants.
He had carried out artificial fertilization on plants many times in order to grow a plant with a new color or seed shape.
Artificial fertilization is the process of transferring pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part of another flower.
Artificial fertilization is done in order to have seeds that will grow into plants that have a desired trait, such as yellow flowers.
Mendel returned to Brünn in 1854 as a natural history and physics teacher.
