You need energy for everything you do.

Which has more glucose, a salad or a piece of meat?

Food provides building materials for your body.
Your body needs building materials so it can grow and repair itself.
Specifically, it needs these materials to produce more cells and its components.
Food contains substances that help control body processes.
Your body processes must be kept in balance for good health.
For all these reasons, you must have a regular supply of nutrients.
Nutrients are chemicals in food that your body needs.
There are five types of nutrients.
Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are categories of organic compounds.
They give your body energy, though carbohydrates are the main source of energy.
Proteins provide building materials, such as amino acids to build your own proteins.
Proteins, vitamins, and minerals also help control body processes.
