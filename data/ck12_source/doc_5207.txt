wrinkled or angular
dominant :
The allele that is expressed when two separate alleles are inherited.
F 1 generation :
The hybrid offspring of the P (parental) generation; first filial generation.
F 2 generation :
The offspring of the F 1 generation; second filial generation.
monohybrid cross :
A hybridization in which only one characteristic is examined.
P generation :
The initial generation of a cross; parental generation.
recessive :
The allele that is expressed only in the absence of a dominant allele.
true-breeding :
A plant that will always produce offspring with the parental trait when it self-pollinates.
Mendel’s use of mathematics in his pea plant studies was important to the confidence he had in his results.
Mendel carried out his first experiments with true-breeding plants and continued them over a span of three generations.
For each of the seven characteristics Mendel studied, he observed a similar ratio in the inheritance of dominant to recessive traits (3:1) in the F 2 generation.
