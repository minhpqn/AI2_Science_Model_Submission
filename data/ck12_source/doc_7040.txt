Question :
The half-life of ^{239} Pu is 24,119 years.
You have 31.25 micrograms left, and the sample you are studying started with 2000 micrograms.
How long has this rock been decaying?
Answer :
We will use the equation for time and simply plug in the known values. t=t_H\frac{\ln{\frac{N}{N_0}}}{\ln{\frac{1}{2}}}=24119\mathrm{y}\frac{\ln{\frac{31.25\mu\mathrm{g}}{2000\mu\mathrm{g}}}}{\ln{\frac{1}{2}}}=144,700\mathrm{years}

The half-life of ^{239}\mathrm{Pu} is 24,119 years.
You have 31.25 micrograms left, and the sample you are studying started with 2000 micrograms.
How long has this rock been decaying?
A certain fossilized plant is 23,000 years old.
Anthropologist Hwi Kim determines that when the plant died, it contained 0.250 \;\mathrm{g} of radioactive ^{14}\mathrm{C} (t_H = 5730 \;\mathrm{years}) .
How much should be left now?
Jaya unearths a guinea pig skeleton from the backyard.
She runs a few tests and determines that 99.7946 % of the original ^{14}\mathrm{C} is still present in the guinea pigâ€™s bones.
The half-life of ^{14}\mathrm{C} is 5730 years.
When did the guinea pig die?
You use the carbon dating technique to determine the age of an old skeleton you found in the woods.
From the total mass of the skeleton and the knowledge of its molecular makeup you determine that the amount of ^{14}\mathrm{C} it began with was 0.021 grams.
