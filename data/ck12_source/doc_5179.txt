In other words, sexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically unique.
They differ from both parents and also from each other.
This occurs through a number of mechanisms, including crossing-over, the independent assortment of chromosomes during anaphase I, and random fertilization.
When homologous chromosomes form pairs during prophase I of meiosis I, crossing-over can occur.
Crossing-over is the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.
It results in new combinations of genes on each chromosome.
When cells divide during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly distributed during anaphase I, separating and segregating independently of each other.
This is called independent assortment .
It results in gametes that have unique combinations of chromosomes.
In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring.
But which two of the millions of possible gametes will it be?
This is likely to be a matter of chance.
It is obviously another source of genetic variation in offspring.
This is known as random fertilization.
All of these mechanisms working together result in an amazing amount of potential variation.
Each human couple, for example, has the potential to produce more than 64 trillion genetically unique children.
No wonder we are all different!
As mentioned above, crossing-over occurs during prophase I, and it is the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.
Recall during prophase I, homologous chromosomes line up in pairs, gene-for-gene down their entire length, forming a configuration with four chromatids, known as a tetrad .
The process of pairing the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis .
