After the larynx, air moves into the trachea , or wind pipe.
This is a long tube that leads down to the chest.
In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi .
The bronchi contain cartilage, which prevents them from collapsing.
Mucus in the bronchi traps any remaining particles in air.
Tiny, hair-like structures called cilia line the bronchi and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body.
Finally, air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles .
The bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called alveoli
Pulmonary Gas Exchange
Pulmonary gas exchange is the exchange of gases between inhaled air and the blood.
It occurs in the alveoli of the lungs.
Alveoli (singular, alveolus) are grape-like clusters surrounded by networks of thin-walled pulmonary capillaries.
After you inhale, there is a greater concentration of oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries, so oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood across the capillaries (see Figure below ).
Carbon dioxide, in contrast, is more concentrated in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries than in the alveoli, so it diffuses in the opposite direction.

Alveoli are tiny sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place.
After the blood in the pulmonary capillaries becomes saturated with oxygen, it leaves the lungs and travels to the heart.
The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood into arteries, which carry it throughout the body.
Eventually, the blood travels into capillaries that supply body tissues.
