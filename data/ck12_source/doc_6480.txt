electrical potential:
A measurement of the ability of a voltaic cell to produce an electric current.
reduction potential:  A measure of the tendency of a given half-reaction to occur as a reduction in an electrochemical cell.
Standard Hydrogen Electrode
Describe the hydrogen electrode.
Describe how this electrode is used in determining reduction potentials.

What is a standard?
We all compare ourselves to someone.
Can I run faster than you?
Am I taller than my dad?
These are relative comparisons that donâ€™t give a lot of useful data.
When we use a standard for our comparisons, everybody can tell how one thing compares to another.
One meter is the same distance everywhere in the world, so a 100 meter track in one country is exactly the same distance as a 100 meter track in another country.
We now have a universal basis for comparison.
Standard Hydrogen Electrode
The activity series allows us to predict the relative reactivities of different materials when used in oxidation-reduction processes.
We also know we can create electric current by a combination of chemical processes.
But how do we predict the expected amount of current that will flow through the system?
We measure this flow as voltage (an electromotive force or potential difference).
