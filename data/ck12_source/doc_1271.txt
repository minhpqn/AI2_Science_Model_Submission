Ocean-Continent Convergent Plate Boundaries
Explain a convergence plate boundary.
Describe ocean-continent convergence and ocean-ocean convergence.
What do you see when oceanic lithosphere subducts?
At a convergent plate boundary, when one plate is oceanic, there are large volcanoes.
These volcanoes are found in lines that outline the subduction zone.
Earthquakes also happen in these zones.
The Aleutian Islands that border southern Alaska are an island arc.
In this winter image from space, the volcanoes are covered with snow.
Convergent Plate Boundaries
A convergent plate boundary forms where two plates collide.
That collision can happen between a continent and oceanic crust, between two oceanic plates, or between two continents.
Oceanic crust is always destroyed in these collisions.
Oceanic crust may collide with a continent.
The oceanic plate is denser, so it undergoes subduction .
This means that the oceanic plate sinks beneath the continent.
This occurs at an ocean trench ( Figure below ).
Subduction zones are where subduction takes place.
Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate causes earthquakes and forms a line of volcanoes known as a continental arc
Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate forms a line of volcanoes known as a continental arc and causes earthquakes.
