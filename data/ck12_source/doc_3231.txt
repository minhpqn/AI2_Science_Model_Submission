Which electromagnetic waves do you think have higher frequencies: visible light or X rays?
A:
X rays are harmful but visible light is harmless, so you can infer that X rays have higher frequencies than visible light.
Speed, Wavelength, and Frequency
The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency.
Because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through space, a wave with a shorter wavelength must have a higher frequency, and vice versa.
This relationship is represented by the equation:
Speed = Wavelength × Frequency
The equation for wave speed can be rewritten as:
\text{Frequency} = \frac{\text{Speed}}{\text{Wavelength}} or \text{Wavelength} = \frac{\text{Speed}}{\text{Frequency}}
Therefore, if either wavelength or frequency is known, the missing value can be calculated.
Consider an electromagnetic wave that has a wavelength of 3 meters.
Its speed, like the speed of all electromagnetic waves, is 3.0 × 10 8 meters per second.
Its frequency can be found by substituting these values into the frequency equation:
\text{Frequency} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^8 \ \text{m/s}}{3.0 \ \text{m}} =1 .0 \times 10^8 \ \text{waves/s} , or 1.0 × 10 8 Hz
Q:
What is the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave that has a frequency of 3.0 × 10 8 hertz?
A:
Use the wavelength equation:
\text{Wavelength} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^8 \ \text{m/s}}{3.0 \times 10^8 \ \text{waves/s}}=1.0 \ \text{m}
