Some are part of the pipeline that food passes through.
Others make special chemicals that are needed for digestion.
Organs of the Digestive System
The mouth and stomach are just two of the organs of the digestive system.
Other digestive system organs are the esophagus, small intestine, and large intestine.
Below, you can see that the digestive organs form a long tube ( Figure below ).
In adults, this tube is about 30 feet long!
At one end of the tube is the mouth.
At the other end is the anus.
Food enters the mouth and then passes through the rest of the digestive system.
Food waste leaves the body through the anus.
The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas secrete important substances for chemical digestion
This drawing shows the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.
These organs are part of the digestive system.
Food does not pass through them, but they secrete substances needed for chemical digestion.
The organs of the digestive system are lined with muscles.
The muscles contract, or tighten, to push food through the system ( Figure below ).
The muscles contract in waves.
The waves pass through the digestive system like waves through a slinky.
This movement of muscle contractions is called peristalsis .
