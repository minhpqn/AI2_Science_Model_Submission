For water, the value of  K_b is 0.512°C/ m .
So the boiling temperature of a 1-molal aqueous solution of any nonvolatile molecular solute is 100.512°C.
Boiling point elevation is defined.
Calculations involving the molal boiling point elevation constant are outlined.
Solve the problems at the link below:
Why does addition of a solute to water increase the boiling point?
What does the molal boiling point elevation constant tell us?
Addition of KCl raises the boiling point of 1.0 kg water by 1.014°C.
How many moles of KCl were added?
boiling point elevation:
The difference in temperature between the boiling point of the pure solvent and that of the solution.
molal boiling-point elevation constant:
A constant that is equal to the change in the boiling point for a 1-molal solution of a nonvolatile molecular solute.
Electrolytes and Colligative Properties
Perform calculations involving the effects of electrolytes on colligative properties.
The presence of ions in solutions affect the properties of that solution
What effect do ions have?
The addition of ions creates significant changes in properties of solutions.
Water molecules surround the ions and are somewhat tightly bound to them.
Colligative properties are affected because the solvent properties are no longer the same as those in the pure solvent.
