Growth of Human Populations
Learn how population size can be limited.
Describe the growth in human population in the past and projected into the future.
How fast is human population growing?
There are more than 7 billion people in the world.
As you read this sentence, at least three more people will be added.
Think about that for second or so, and thereâ€™s another three.
Why is the human population growing so fast?
Has it always grown this fast?
What causes populations to grow?
Human Population Numbers
Bacteria in a dish with ample nutrients double in population until there is no more space.
Every population eventually reaches its maximum size.
The population of bacteria in the dish reaches its carrying capacity.
The carrying capacity is the number of an organisms that can live with the resources that are available.
The limiting factor for the bacteria in the dish is space.
That's the factor that limits the population of the bacteria in the dish.
If there were unlimited space then maybe nutrients would be the limiting factor.
Some resource will always run out to limit a population.
Let's now apply these concepts to the human population.
