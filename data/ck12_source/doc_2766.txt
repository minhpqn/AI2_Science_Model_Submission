Functions of Nucleic Acids
DNA stores genetic information in the cells of all living things.
It contains the genetic code.
This is the code that instructs cells how to make proteins.
The instructions are encoded in the sequence of nitrogen bases in the nucleotide chains of DNA.
RNA copies and interprets the genetic code in DNA and is also involved in the synthesis of proteins based on the code.

Q:
DNA is found only in the nucleus of cells, but proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm of cells, outside of the nucleus.
How do you think the instructions encoded in DNA reach the cytoplasm so they can be used to make proteins?
A:
After RNA copies the instructions in DNA, it carries them from the nucleus to a site of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm, where the instructions are translated into a protein.
Nucleic acids are one of four classes of biochemical molecules.
Nucleic acids include RNA (ribonucleic acid) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).
Nucleic acids consist of chains of small molecules called nucleotides, which are held together by covalent bonds.
RNA is made of one nucleotide chain, and DNA is made of two.
The two chains of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds in the shape of a double helix.
