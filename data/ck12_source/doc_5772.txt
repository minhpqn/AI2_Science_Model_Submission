In general, the next higher s sublevel is already filled or has one electron missing.
Many transition element compounds are brightly colored due to the inner-level d electron transitions.
Use the link below to answer the following questions:

What is unique about the transition elements in terms of electron configurations?
Why are these elements often referred to as “ d -block” elements?
Which transition group elements can be found in their free state in nature?
Why do many transition element compounds have bright colors?
transition element:
Elements can be found in Groups 3-12 (old groups IIA-IIB) on the period table.
The term refers to the fact that the d sublevel, which is in the process of being filled, is in a lower principal energy level than the s sublevel filled before it.
sublevel:
Electron orbitals known as s, p, d, or f.
