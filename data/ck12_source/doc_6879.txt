It is possible that food webs could collapse if insect populations decline.
In some parts of the world, insects are used for food by humans.
Insects are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and are prized as delicacies in many third-world countries.
In fact, it is difficult to find an insect that is not eaten in one form or another by people.
Among the most popular are cicadas, locusts, mantises, grubs, caterpillars, crickets, ants, and wasps.
Many people support this idea to provide a source of protein in human nutrition.
From South America to Japan, people eat roasted insects, like grasshoppers or beetles.
