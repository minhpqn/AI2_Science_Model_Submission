Be small enough that it isnâ€™t a star itself.
Have cleared the area of its orbit of smaller objects.
The dwarf planets of our solar system are exciting proof of how much we are learning about our solar system.
With the discovery of many new objects in our solar system, astronomers refined the definition of a dwarf planet in 2006.
According to the IAU, a dwarf planet must:
Orbit a star.
Have enough mass to be nearly spherical.
Not have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects.
Not be a moon.
So dwarf planets are like planets except for one thing.
They have not cleared their orbits of smaller objects.
They do not have enough gravity to do this.
There are five recognized dwarf planets in the solar system:
Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris.
The reclassification of Pluto to the new category dwarf planet stirred up a great deal of controversy.
How the classification of Pluto has evolved is an interesting story in science.
From the time it was discovered in 1930 until the early 2000s, Pluto was considered the ninth planet.
When astronomers first located Pluto, the telescopes were not as good.
Pluto and its moon, Charon, were seen as one much larger object ( Figure below ).
With better telescopes, astronomers realized that Pluto was much smaller than they had thought.
