It may take 50 million years for a photon to travel all the way through the radiative zone.
The Convection Zone
The convection zone surrounds the radiative zone.
In the convection zone, hot material from near the Sunâ€™s center rises.
This material cools at the surface and then plunges back downward.
The material then receives more heat from the radiative zone.

The Sun is made mostly of plasma.
Plasma is superheated gas with a positive electrical charge.
Nuclear fusion takes place in the Sun's extremely hot core.
The radiative zone is outside the core.
The convection zone is where convection takes place.
It is located outward from the radiative zone.
