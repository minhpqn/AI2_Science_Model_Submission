It is easiest to visualize the wavelength of a wave as the distance from one wave crest to the next.
In an equation, wavelength is represented by the Greek letter lambda (\lambda) .
Depending on the type of wave, wavelength can be measured in meters, centimeters, or nanometers (1 m = 10 9  nm).
The frequency , represented by the Greek letter nu ( \nu ) , is the number of waves that pass a certain point in a specified amount of time.
Typically, frequency is measured in units of cycles per second or waves per second.
One wave per second is also called a Hertz (Hz) and in SI units is a reciprocal second (s -1 ).
Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave.
The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave.
However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time.
Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves.
Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related.
As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases.
The equation that relates the two is:
\ c = \lambda \nu
The variable  c is the speed of light.
For the relationship to hold mathematically, if the speed of light is used in m/s, the wavelength must be in meters and the frequency in Hertz.
Sample Problem:
Wavelength and Frequency
The color orange within the visible light spectrum has a wavelength of about 620 nm.
What is the frequency of orange light?
