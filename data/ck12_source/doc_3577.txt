This energy in NADPH is then used in the Calvin cycle.
Where do the protons used in the light reactions come from?
The protons used in the light reactions come from photolysis, the splitting of water, in which H 2 O molecules are broken into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen atoms.
In addition, the energy from sunlight is used to pump protons into the thylakoid lumen during the first electron transport chain, forming a chemiosmotic gradient.
How do you distinguish between the Calvin cycle and the Krebs cycle?
The Calvin cycle is part of the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.
The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH.
The Krebs cycle is part of cellular respiration.
This cycle makes ATP and NAPH.
Do photosynthesis and cellular respiration occur at the same time in a plant?
Yes.
Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, whereas cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria.
Photosynthesis makes glucose and oxygen, which are then used as the starting products for cellular respiration.
Cellular respiration makes carbon dioxide and water (and ATP), which are the starting products (together with sunlight) for photosynthesis.
A common student misconception is that plants photosynthesize only during daylight and conduct cellular respiration only at night.
Some teaching literature even states this.
Though it is true the light reactions can only occur when the sun is out, cellular respiration occurs continuously in plants, not just at night.
The “dark reactions” of photosynthesis are a misnomer that often leads students to believe that photosynthetic carbon fixation occurs at night.
This is not true.
It is preferable to use the term Calvin cycle or light-independent reactions instead of dark reactions.
