Stem specializations:
Baobad, Redwood, Vines, Vine tendrils, Rhizomes, Thorns
Stem specializations such as these let plants grow in many different habitats.
Stem Tissues and Functions
Like roots, the stems of vascular plants are made of dermal, vascular, and ground tissues.
A single-celled layer of epidermis protects and waterproofs the stem and controls gas exchange.
In trees, some of the epidermal tissue is replaced by bark.
Bark is a combination of tissues that provides a tough, woody external covering on the stems of trees.
The inner part of bark is alive and growing; the outer part is dead and provides strength, support, and protection.
Ground tissue forms the interior of the stem.
The large central vacuoles of ground tissue cells fill with water to support the plant.
The cells may also store food.
Bundles of vascular tissue run through the ground tissue of a stem and transport fluids.
Plants may vary in how these bundles are arranged.
The stems of all vascular plants get longer through primary growth.
This occurs in primary meristem at the tips and nodes of the stems.
Most stems also grow in thickness through secondary growth.
This occurs in secondary meristem, which is located in and around the vascular tissues.
Secondary growth forms secondary vascular tissues and bark.
In many trees, the yearly growth of new vascular tissues results in an annual growth ring like the one in Figure below .
