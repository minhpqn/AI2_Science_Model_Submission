Give examples of land fowl and waterfowl.

Raptor vs.
Landfowl.
Any obvious differences?
Of course there are.
That is like comparing a turkey to an owl.
And there are also flightless birds, birds that live near water, and parrots.
With almost 10,000 species of birds, there are bound to be significant differences.
Classification of Birds
There are about 10,000 living species of birds.
Almost all of them can fly, but there are several exceptions.
Some birds have lost the ability to fly during the course of their evolution.
Several flightless birds are shown in Figure below .
They include the ostrich, kiwi, rhea, cassowary, and moa.
All of these birds have long legs and are adapted for running.
The penguins shown in the figure are also flightless birds, but they have a very different body shape.
Thatâ€™s because they are adapted for swimming rather than running.
