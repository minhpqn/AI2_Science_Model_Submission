Abnormal Numbers of Sex Chromosomes
What about when a person has more than two Y chromosomes, or more than two X chromosomes?
Or a female with only one X chromosome?
Sex-chromosome abnormalities may be caused by nondisjunction of one or more sex chromosomes.
Many conditions are known in which there are an abnormal number of sex chromosomes.
An X chromosome may be missing (XO), or there may be an extra one (XXX or XXY).
There may also be an extra Y chromosome (XYY).
Any combination of X and Y chromosomes, as long as there is a Y chromosome, will produce a male (up to XXXXY).
These individuals can lead relatively normal lives, but they cannot have children.
They may also have some degree of mental retardation.
These syndromes include Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome, Turner syndrome and trisomy X.
Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells.
