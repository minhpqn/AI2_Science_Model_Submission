A person with a brown allele will have brown hair; a person with no brown alleles will be blond.
This explains why two brown-haired parents can produce a blond-haired child.
The other gene pair has a non-red vs. red set of alleles, where the non-red allele is dominant and the allele for red hair is recessive.
A person with two copies of the red-haired allele will have red hair, but it will be either auburn or bright reddish orange depending on whether the first gene pair gives brown or blond hair, respectively.
Red hair is due to an epistatic effect on the brown/blonde hair color locus.
allele :
An alternative form or different version of a gene.
epistasis :
When a gene at one location (locus) alters the phenotypic expression of a gene at another locus.
epistatic :
The gene whose phenotype is expressed during epistasis.
gene pool :
The complete set of unique alleles in a species or population.
hypostatic :
The phenotype altered or suppressed during epistasis; the gene that is not expressed.
modifier genes :
Genes that modify the effects of other genes during epistasis.
pleiotropy :
A single gene controlling or influencing multiple phenotypic traits.
Traits controlled by more than two alleles have multiple alleles.
