This region gets so much snow because it is on the leeward side of the Great Lakes.
The area receives lake-effect snow.
If you plan to visit in winter, strap on your snow shoes!
Like hurricanes, winter storms develop from cyclones.
But in the case of winter storms, the cyclones form at higher latitudes.
In North America, cyclones often form when the jet stream dips south in the winter.
This lets dry polar air pour south.
At the same time, warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico flows north.
When the two air masses meet, the differences in temperature and pressure cause strong winds and heavy precipitation.
Blizzards and lake-effect snow storms are two types of winter storms that occur in the U.S.
A blizzard ( Figure below ) is a snow storm that has high winds.
To be called a blizzard, a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of Â¼ mile or less because of wind-blown snow.

Do they ever occur where you live?
Blizzards are dangerous storms.
The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts.
Along with the poor visibility, the snow drifts make driving risky.
The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous.
