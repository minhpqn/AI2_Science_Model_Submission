About 4,000 such reactions are known to be catalyzed by enzymes, but the number may be even higher.
Enzymes allow reactions to occur at the rate necessary for life.
In animals, an important function of enzymes is to help digest food.
Digestive enzymes speed up reactions that break down large molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules the body can use.
Without digestive enzymes, animals would not be able to break down food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they need to survive.
Enzymes are biological catalysts.
They speed up biochemical reactions.
Enzymes are involved in most of the chemical reactions that take place in organisms.
