What are shrimp?
Shrimp are an example of crustaceans, one group within the arthropods.
Shrimp live on the ocean floor in many parts of the world.
Shrimp are not only food for humans; they are also an important food source for larger marine animals.
Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods, consisting of almost 52,000 species.
The majority of crustaceans are aquatic.
Some live in the ocean, while others live in fresh water.
A few groups have adapted to living on land, such as land crabs, hermit crabs, and woodlice ( Figure below ).
Crustaceans are among the most successful animals, and can be considered the dominant aquatic animals.
Though small, crustaceans are numerous enough to be the main source of energy for large ocean mammals.
They are found as much in the oceans as insects are on land.
