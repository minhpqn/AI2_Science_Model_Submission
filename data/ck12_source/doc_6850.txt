And they both have a hard outer layer.
Because they share these and other features, they are both classified as arthropods.
What are Arthropods?
How often do you think you see an arthropod?
Well, have you ever looked up close at an ant?
A spider?
A fly?
A moth?
With over a million described species (and many more yet to be described) in the phylum containing arthropods, chances are, you encounter one of these organisms every day, without even leaving your house.
Arthropods are a very diverse group of animals.
In fact, they are the biggest group of animals on the planet, with upwards of 5 million distinct species.
Types of Arthropods
Arthropods belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which means “jointed feet,” and includes four living subphyla.
Chelicerata, which includes spiders ( Figure below ), mites, and scorpions.
In these animals, the first pair of appendages are often modified as fangs or pincers, and are used to manipulate food.
Spiders have eight legs.
Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes.
All of these animals live on land, and can have anywhere from ten to nearly 200 pairs of appendages.
Hexapoda, which includes the insects.
These animals dominate the land.
