The radius of an atom is well under 1 nanometer, which is one-billionth of a meter.
If a size that small is hard to imagine, consider this: trillions of atoms would fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Although all atoms are very small, elements vary in the size of their atoms.
The Figure below compares the sizes of atoms of more than 40 different elements.
The elements in the figure are represented by chemical symbols, such as H for hydrogen and He for helium.
Of course, real atoms are much smaller than the circles representing them in the Figure below .

Q:
Which element in the Figure above has the biggest atoms?
A:
The element in the figure with the biggest atoms is cesium (Cs).
Although atoms are very tiny, they consist of even smaller particles.
Three main types of particles that make up all atoms are:
protons, which have a positive electric charge.
electrons, which have a negative electric charge.
neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge.
The model in the Figure below shows how these particles are arranged in an atom.
The particular atom represented by the model is helium, but the particles of all atoms are arranged in the same way.
At the center of the atom is a dense area called the nucleus, where all the protons and neutrons are clustered closely together.
The electrons constantly move around the nucleus.
