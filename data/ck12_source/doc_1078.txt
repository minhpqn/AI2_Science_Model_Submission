There are many other types of maps other than road maps.
Some examples include:
Political or geographic maps show the outlines and borders of states and/or countries.
Satellite view maps show terrains and vegetation: forests, deserts, and mountains.
Relief maps show elevations of areas.
They are usually on a larger scale, such as the whole Earth, rather than a local area.
Topographic maps show detailed elevations of features on the map.
Climate maps show average temperatures and rainfall.
Precipitation maps show the amount of rainfall in different areas.
Weather maps show storms, air masses, and fronts.
Radar maps show storms and rainfall.
Geologic maps detail the types and locations of rocks found in an area.
These are but a few types of maps that various Earth scientists might use.
You can easily carry a map around in your pocket or bag.
Maps are easy to use, because they are flat or two-dimensional.
However, the world is three-dimensional.
So, how do mapmakers represent a three-dimensional world on flat paper?
Maps are two-dimensional representations of a surface, usually Earth's.
Maps use symbols and have legends.
This is so they can display the most amount of information in the least amount of space.
