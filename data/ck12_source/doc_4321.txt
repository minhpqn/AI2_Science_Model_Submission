In most echinoderms, the canals have external projections called tube feet (see Figure below ).
The feet have suckers on the ends.
Muscle contractions force water into the feet, causing them to extend outward.
As the feet extend, they attach their suckers to new locations, farther away from their previous points of attachment.
This results in a slow but powerful form of movement.
The suckers are very strong.
They can even be used to pry open the shells of prey.

Tube Feet of a Sea Star.
The tube feet of a sea star (in white) are part of its water vascular system.
There is a sucker on the end of each foot that allows the animal to “walk” slowly over a surface.
The suckers are strong enough to pry open shells.
Echinoderms lack respiratory and excretory systems.
Instead, the thin walls of their tube feet allow oxygen to diffuse in and wastes to diffuse out.
Echinoderms also lack a centralized nervous system.
They have an open circulatory system and lack a heart.
On the other hand, echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and a complete digestive system.
Echinoderms use pheromones to communicate with each other.
They detect the chemicals with sensory cells on their body surface.
Some echinoderms also have simple eyes ( ocelli ) that can sense light.
