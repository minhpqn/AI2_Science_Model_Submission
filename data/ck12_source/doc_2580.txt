Elements in other groups vary in their reactivity but are generally less reactive than elements in groups 1, 2, 16, or
Q:
Find calcium (Ca) in the periodic table (see Figure above ).
Based on its position in the table, how reactive do you think calcium is?
Name another element with which calcium might react.
A:
Calcium is a group 2 element with two valence electrons.
Therefore, it is very reactive and gives up electrons in chemical reactions.
It is likely to react with an element with six valence electrons that “wants” to gain two electrons.
This would be an element in group 6, such as oxygen.
Valence Electrons and Electricity
Valence electrons also determine how well—if at all—the atoms of an element conduct electricity.
The copper wires in the cable in the Figure below are coated with plastic.
Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity, so it is used for wires that carry electric current.
Plastic contains mainly carbon, which cannot conduct electricity, so it is used as insulation on the wires.
Plastic insulates copper wires
Q:
Why do copper and carbon differ in their ability to conduct electricity?
A:
Atoms of metals such as copper easily give up valence electrons.
