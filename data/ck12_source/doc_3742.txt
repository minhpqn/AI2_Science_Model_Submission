The individual in which the mutation first appeared has even been identified.
Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car engine.
The chance that the random change would improve the functioning of the car is very small.
The change is far more likely to result in a car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all.
By the same token, any random change in a gene's DNA is likely to result in a protein that does not function normally or may not function at all.
Such mutations are likely to be harmful.
Harmful mutations may cause genetic disorders or cancer.
A genetic disorder is a disease caused by a mutation in one or a few genes.
A human example is cystic fibrosis.
A mutation in a single gene causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and blocks ducts in digestive organs.
You can watch a video about cystic fibrosis and other genetic disorders at this link:  (9:31).
Cancer is a disease in which cells grow out of control and form abnormal masses of cells.
It is generally caused by mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle.
Because of the mutations, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide without limits.
Cancer genes can be inherited.

Albino Redwoods, Ghosts of the Forest
What happens if a plant does not have chlorophyll?
They would lack the part of the leaf that makes them green.
So these plants could be referred to as albino.
