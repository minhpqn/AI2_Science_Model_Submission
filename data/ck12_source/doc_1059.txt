Many features discussed in the concepts presented in this text can be seen in the Southwest.
The Southwestern United States ( Figure above ) is a great place to study geology.
The region is so arid that in most locations rocks and structures are easily seen.
In several concepts we will visit parts of the Southwest to view geology in the field.
The Grand Canyon
From the rim, the Grand Canyon gives a sense of the vastness of geologic time and the immensity of the planet.
Geologists say that the Grand Canyon ( Figure above ) has "layer cake geology." This is because the rock strata are in layers.
They are extremely easy to see.
Sedimentary rocks are like a book that tells the story of the environment in which they formed.
Rock units can be traced across large expanses.
Looking down into the Grand Canyon, you get a sense of the vastness of space and of time.
The Hawaiian Islands from space
The Hawaiian Islands from space.
The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean.
The islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest.
The youngest island is the Big Island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain.
The volcanoes get older through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands through the northwest.
The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting almost continuously since 1983.
There are also eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loihi seamount.
Loihi is the youngest volcano.
