As a result, the middle part of the molecule near oxygen has a negative charge, and the other parts of the molecule have a positive charge.
In essence, the electrons are "pulled" toward the nucleus of the oxygen atom and away from the hydrogen atom nuclei.
Water is a polar molecule, with an unequal distribution of charge throughout the molecule.
This model is an atomic diagram of water, showing the two hydrogen atoms and oxygen atom in the center.
The protons (red) are in the center (nucleus) of each atom, and the electrons (light blue) circle each nucleus.
This diagram shows the positive and negative parts of a water molecule.
It also depicts how a charge, such as on an ion (Na or Cl, for example) can interact with a water molecule.
Opposite electrical charges attract one another.
Therefore, the positive part of one water molecule is attracted to the negative parts of other water molecules.
Because of this attraction, bonds form between hydrogen and oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules, as demonstrated in Figure below .
This type of bond always involves a hydrogen atom, so it is called a hydrogen bond .
Hydrogen bonds are bonds between molecules, and they are not as strong as bonds within molecules.
Nonetheless, they help hold water molecules together.
Hydrogen Bonding in Water Molecule
Hydrogen bonds form between positively and negatively charged parts of water molecules.
The bonds hold the water molecules together.
How do you think this might affect water’s properties?
Hydrogen bonds can also form within a single large organic molecule.
For example, hydrogen bonds that form between different parts of a protein molecule bend the molecule into a distinctive shape, which is important for the protein’s functions.
Hydrogen bonds also hold together the two nucleotide chains of a DNA molecule.
