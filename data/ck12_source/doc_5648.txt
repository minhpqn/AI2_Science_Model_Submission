Millikan later used the information from his oil drop experiment to calculate the mass of an electron.
The accepted value today is 9.10938215 Ã—10 -31  kg.
The incredibly small mass of the electron was found to be approximately 1/1840 the mass of a hydrogen atom.
Therefore, scientists realized that atoms must contain another particle that carries a positive charge and is far more massive than the electron.
Participate in a simulation of Millikan's oil drop experiment at this site:
The oil drop experiment allowed Millikan to determine the charge on the electron.
He later used this data to determine the mass of the electron.

Where did the oil drops go to be measured?
coulomb:
C is short for coulomb, which is one ampere/second.
electron:  A subatomic particle with a negative charge.
