Give an example.
Describe the shape of DNA.
How are DNA and RNA related to proteins?

Understanding chemistry is essential to fully understand biology.
Why?
A general understanding of chemistry is necessary to understand biology.
Essentially, our cells are just thousands of chemicals — made of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur — in just the right combinations.
And these chemicals combine through chemical reactions.
The element chlorine (Cl) is a greenish poison.
Would you eat chlorine?
Of course not, but you often eat a compound containing chlorine.
In fact, you probably eat this chlorine compound just about every day.
Do you know what it is?
It’s table salt.
Table salt is sodium chloride (NaCl), which forms when chlorine and sodium (Na) combine in certain proportions.
How does chlorine, a toxic green chemical, change into harmless white table salt?
It happens in a chemical reaction.
