It is the mechanism that is responsible for water transport in plants through roots and stems, and in animals through small blood vessels.
Hydrogen bonds also explain why water’s boiling point (100°C) is higher than the boiling points of similar substances without hydrogen bonds.
Because of water’s relatively high boiling point, most water exists in a liquid state on Earth.
Liquid water is needed by all living organisms.
Therefore, the availability of liquid water enables life to survive over much of the planet.
Furthermore, water has a high specific heat because it takes a lot of energy to raise or lower the temperature of water.
As a result, water plays a very important role in temperature regulation.
Since cells are made up of water, this property helps to maintain homeostasis .
Density of Ice and Water
The melting point of water is 0°C.
Below this temperature, water is a solid (ice).
Unlike most chemical substances, water in a solid state has a lower density than water in a liquid state.
This is because water expands when it freezes.
Again, hydrogen bonding is the reason.
Hydrogen bonds cause water molecules to line up less efficiently in ice than in liquid water.
As a result, water molecules are spaced farther apart in ice, giving ice a lower density than liquid water.
A substance with lower density floats on a substance with higher density.
This explains why ice floats on liquid water, whereas many other solids sink to the bottom of liquid water.
In a large body of water, such as a lake or the ocean, the water with the greatest density always sinks to the bottom.
Water is most dense at about 4°C.
