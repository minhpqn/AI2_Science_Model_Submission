Water exists in an equilibrium with H + and OH - , with the dissociation constant for water being 1 × 10 -14 .
So, in the solution resulting from the reaction given here, the [H + ] is 1 × 10 -7  M, a very insignificant amount.
For all practical purposes, this reaction can be said to go to completion.
Non-reversible reactions are those that go to completion.
