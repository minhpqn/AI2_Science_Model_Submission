Sebum is secreted into hair follicles and makes its way to the skin surface.
It waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out.
Sebum also has antibacterial properties, so it inhibits the growth of microorganisms on the skin.
Sweat glands produce the salty fluid called sweat, which contains excess water, salts, and other waste products.
The glands have ducts that pass through the epidermis and open to the surface through pores in the skin.

Functions of the Skin
The skin has multiple roles in the body.
Many of these roles are related to homeostasis.
The skinâ€™s main functions are preventing water loss from the body and serving as a barrier to the entry of microorganisms.
In addition, melanin in the skin blocks UV light and protects deeper layers from its damaging effects.
The skin also helps regulate body temperature.
When the body is too warm, sweat is released by the sweat glands and spreads over the skin surface.
As the sweat evaporates, it cools the body.
Blood vessels in the skin also dilate, or widen, when the body is too warm.
This allows more blood to flow through the skin, bringing body heat to the surface, where it radiates into the environment.
When the body is too cool, sweat glands stop producing sweat, and blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, thus conserving body heat.
In part because it is exposed to the environment, the skin is prone to injury and other problems.
