A hunter with an air blaster gun is preparing to shoot at a monkey hanging from a tree.
He is pointing his gun directly at the monkey.
The monkey’s got to think quickly!
What is the monkey’s best chance to avoid being smacked by the rubber ball?
The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will pass beneath him due to gravity.
The monkey should let go when the hunter fires.
Since the gun is pointing right at him, he can avoid getting hit by falling to the ground.
The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will sail above him since its vertical velocity increases by 9.8 \;\mathrm{m/s} every second of flight.
The monkey should let go when the hunter fires.
He will fall faster than the bullet due to his greater mass, and it will fly over his head.
You are riding your bike in a straight line with a speed of 10 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
You accidentally drop your calculator out of your backpack from a height of 2.0 \;\mathrm{m} above the ground.
When it hits the ground, where is the calculator in relation to the position of your backpack? (Neglect air resistance.)
You and your backpack are 6.3\;\mathrm{m} ahead of the calculator.
You and your backpack are directly above the calculator.
You and your backpack are 6.3 \;\mathrm{m} behind the calculator.
