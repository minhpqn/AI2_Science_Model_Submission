That group is called a phenyl group and so the molecule below is called 2-phenylbutane.
Example of nomenclature with phenyl as a substituent
The structure and nomenclature of aromatic compounds are described.
Read the material at the link below:
At the bottom of the page, click on “Questions on naming aromatic compounds” in the green box and do as many of the problems (both naming and structure drawing) as you can.
What is a characteristic of aromatic compounds?
What is the rule for numbering substituents on the ring?
How is numbering affected if there is more than one type of substituent group?
delocalized electrons:
Electrons that are not confined to the bond between two atoms, but are instead allowed to move between three or more.
Define alkyl halide.
Give the nomenclature rules for naming alkyl halides.
Use the nomenclature rules to name alkyl halides when give the structural formula.
Aerosols containing CFCs damage the ozone layer
Is the hole in the ozone getting bigger?
A class of simple alkyl halides called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was once very widely used in aerosol sprays and as refrigerants.
One such example is CCl 3 F, or trichlorofluoromethane.
Unfortunately, CFCs are harmful to the ozone layer of our upper atmosphere.
Ozone is critical in limiting the amount of damaging ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth.
CFCs react with the ozone and damage it, leaving the earth less protected.
