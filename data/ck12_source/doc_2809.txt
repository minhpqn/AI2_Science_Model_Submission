It’s important to realize that the pH scale is based on powers of ten.
For example, a solution with a pH of 8 is 10 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7, and a solution with a pH of 9 is 100 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7.
Q:
How much more acidic is a solution with a pH of 4 than a solution with a pH of 7?
A:
A solution with a pH of 4 is 1000 (10 × 10 × 10, or 10 3 ) times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 7.
The pH scale measures acidity
Q:
Which solution on the pH scale in the Figure above is the weakest acid?
Which solution is the strongest base?
A:
The weakest acid on the scale is milk, which has a pH value between 6.5 and 6.8.
The strongest base on the scale is liquid drain cleaner, which has a pH of 14.

Why pH Matters
Acidity is an important factor for living things.
For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7.
Fish may also need a pH between 6 and 7.
Certain air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets in the air.
