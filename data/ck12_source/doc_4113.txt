As a result, allele frequencies are constantly changing, and populations are constantly evolving.
As mutations and natural selection occur frequently in nature, it is difficult for a population to be at genetic equilibrium.
The Hardy-Weinberg model also serves a mathematical formula used to predict allele frequencies in a population at genetic equilibrium.
If you know the allele frequencies of one generation, you can use this formula to predict the next generation.
Again, this only works if all five conditions are being met in a population.
If a population stays at genetic equilibrium, then no evolution takes place.
The Hardy-Weinberg model states that a population will remain at genetic equilibrium as long as five conditions are met: (1) No change in the DNA sequence, (2) No migration, (3) A very large population size, (4) Random mating, and (5) No natural selection.
