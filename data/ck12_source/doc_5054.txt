Analyzing what happens when wood burns in a campfire is a good way to begin to understand cellular respiration.
You know that a fire produces light and heat energy.
However, it cannot create energy (remember that energy cannot be created or destroyed).
Fire merely transforms the energy stored in its fuel – chemical energy – into light and heat.
Another way to describe this energy transformation is to say that burning releases the energy stored in fuel.
As energy is transformed, so are the compounds that make up the fuel.
In other words, burning is a chemical reaction.
We could write our understanding of this energy-releasing chemical reaction up to this point as:
Now return to what happens when you blow on a fire.
The fire was "dying out," so you blew on it to get it going again.
Was it movement or something in the air that promoted the chemical reaction?
If you have ever "smothered" a fire, you know that a fire needs something in the air to keep burning.
That something turns out to be oxygen.
Oxygen gas is a reactant in the burning process.
At this point, our equation is:
To complete this equation, we need to know what happens to matter, to the atoms of oxygen, and to the atoms of the fuel during the burning.
If you collect the gas rising above a piece of burning wood in an inverted test tube, you will notice condensation - droplets appearing on the sides of the tube.
To identify the products , the experiment shown below can be performed.
Cobalt chloride paper will change from blue to pink, confirming that these droplets are water.
If you add bromothymol blue (BTB) to a second tube of collected gases, the blue solution will change to green or yellow ( Figure below ), indicating the presence of carbon dioxide.
