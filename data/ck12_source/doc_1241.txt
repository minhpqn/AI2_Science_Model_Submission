Describe how Wegener used each type of evidence to support his idea.
Wegener and the Continental Drift Hypothesis
Define the continental drift hypothesis.
Describe issues with the continental drift hypothesis.
What is continental drift?
Wegener put together a tremendous amount of evidence that the continents had been joined.
He advanced a great idea.
But other scientists didn't accept it.
Wegener’s Continental Drift Hypothesis
Wegener put his idea and his evidence together in his book, The Origin of Continents and Oceans .
The book was first published in 1915.
He included evidence that the continents had been joined.
New editions of the book containing additional evidence were published later.
In his book he said that around 300 million years ago, the continents had all been joined.
They created a single landmass he called Pangaea, meaning “all earth” in ancient Greek.
The supercontinent later broke apart.
Since then the continents have been moving into their current positions.
He called his hypothesis continental drift .
The Problem with the Hypothesis
Wegener had a lot of evidence to support his hypothesis.
