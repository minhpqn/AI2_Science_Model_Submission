Define fluid and describe fluid friction.
Climbing a vertical rock wall means pitting your strength and stamina against the force of gravity, which pulls you down toward the ground.
Another force helps you to climb the vertical rock wall by keeping your hands and feet from slipping.
That force is friction.
Four Types of Friction
Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact.
There are four types of friction: static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction.
Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces.
Fluid friction occurs in liquids and gases.
All four types of friction are described below.
You can see a video demonstration of the different types at this URL:
Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface.
For example, if you are hiking in the woods, there is static friction between your shoes and the trail each time you put down your foot (see Figure below ).
Without this static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it difficult to walk.
In fact, that’s exactly what happens if you try to walk on ice.
That’s because ice is very slippery and offers very little friction.
