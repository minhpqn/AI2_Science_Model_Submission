All animals must eat in order to obtain energy.
Animals also eat to obtain building materials.
Animals eat plants and other animals.
Plants don’t eat.
Instead, they use energy from the sun to make their "food" through the process of photosynthesis .
Mushrooms and other fungi obtain energy from other organisms.
That’s why you often see fungi growing on a fallen tree; the rotting tree is their source of energy ( Figure below ).
Since plants harvest energy from the sun and other organisms get their energy from plants, nearly all the energy of living things initially comes from the sun.

Fungi obtain energy from breaking down dead organisms, such as this rotting log.
Living Things Are Made of Cells
If you zoom in very close on a leaf of a plant, or on the skin on your hand, or a drop of blood, you will find cells, you will find cells ( Figure below ).
Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms.
Most cells are so small that they are usually visible only through a microscope.
Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that live in the ocean, or the Paramecium, shown in Figure below , are unicellular, made of just one cell.
Other organisms have millions, billions, or trillions of cells.
All cells have at least some structures in common, such as ribosomes, which are the sites where proteins are made.
All cells also have DNA and proteins .
The nucleus is clearly visible in the blood cells ( Figure below ).
