Evolution of Simple Cells
Describe how life began.
Outline the importance of cyanobacteria in early Earth history.
What would you see if you could go back 4.5 billion years?
If you took a field trip back in time to the earliest Earth, things would be very different.
Everything would be very hot.
What company would you have?
Maybe some simple microbes.
Maybe not.
For the first 4 billion years of Earth history there is only a little evidence of life.
Organisms were tiny and soft and did not fossilize well.
But scientists use a variety of ways to figure out what this early life was like.
