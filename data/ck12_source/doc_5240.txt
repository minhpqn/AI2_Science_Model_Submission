The coat has both red and white hairs; not pink hairs, but red AND white hairs.
The letter R indicates red hair color, and R’ white hair color.
In cases of codominance, the genotype of the organism can be determined from its phenotype.
The heifer in Figure below shows both coat colors and therefore is RR’ heterozygous for coat color.
The flower in Figure below also has two codominant alleles; it has red and white petals, not pink petals.
Both colors appear in the phenotype.
(left) The roan coat of this cow is made up of red and white hairs.
Both the red and white hair alleles are codominant.
Therefore cattle with a roan coat are heterozygous for coat color ( RR’ ). (right) The flower has red and white petals because of codominance of red-petal and white-petal alleles.
But what if there were pink petals as opposed to red and white petals?
Which allele would be dominant?
Both?
Neither?
Incomplete dominance occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele does not occur.
For example, when red snapdragons ( C R C R ) are crossed with white snapdragons ( C W C W ), the F 1 hybrids are all pink hetrozygotes for flower color ( C R C W ).
The pink color is an intermediate between the two parent colors ( Figure below ).
When two F 1 ( C R C W ) hybrids are crossed they will produce red, pink, and white flowers.
The genotype of an organism with incomplete dominance can be determined from its phenotype ( Table below ).
Snapdragons show incomplete dominance in the traits for flower color.
The pink snapdragon has pink petals because of incomplete dominance of a red-petal allele and a recessive white-petal allele.
