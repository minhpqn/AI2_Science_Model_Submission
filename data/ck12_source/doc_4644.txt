A sperm cell is about two thousandths of an inch long.
And although they are small, they can swim roughly 8 inches in an hour.
To reach an egg, they will ultimately they have to swim around 192,000 times their own length.
Cleavage and Implantation
A day or two after an ovary releases an egg, the egg may unite with a sperm.
Sperm are deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse.
They propel themselves through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube .
This is where fertilization usually takes place.
When a sperm penetrates the egg, it triggers the egg to complete meiosis.
The sperm also undergoes changes.
Its tail falls off, and its nucleus fuses with the nucleus of the egg.
The resulting cell, called a zygote , contains all the chromosomes needed for a new human organism.
Half the chromosomes come from the egg and half from the sperm.
Morula and Blastocyst Stages
The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, where it will take up residence.
As it travels, it divides by mitosis several times to form a ball of cells called a morula .
The cell divisions are called cleavage .
They increase the number of cells but not the overall size of the new organism.
As more cell divisions occur, a fluid-filled cavity forms inside the ball of cells.
At this stage, the ball of cells is called a blastocyst .
