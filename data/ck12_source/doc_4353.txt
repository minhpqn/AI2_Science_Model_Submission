Most fish have several fins for swimming.
They use some of their fins to propel themselves through the water and others to steer the body as they swim.
Fish have a system of muscles for movement.
Muscle contractions ripple through the body in waves from head to tail.
The contractions whip the tail fin against the water to propel the fish through the water.
Most fish have a swim bladder.
This is a balloon-like internal organ that contains gas.
By changing the amount of gas in the bladder, a fish can move up or down through the water column.

Fish Organ Systems
Fish have a circulatory system with a two-chambered heart.
Their digestive system is complete and includes several organs and glands.
Jawed fish use their jaws and teeth to grind up food before passing it to the rest of the digestive tract.
This allows them to consume larger prey.
Fish also have a centralized nervous system with a brain.
Fish brains are small compared with the brains of other vertebrates, but they are large and complex compared with the brains of invertebrates.
Fish also have highly developed sense organs that allow them to see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.
Sharks and some other fish can even sense the very low levels of electricity emitted by other animals.
