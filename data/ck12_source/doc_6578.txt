A polymer is a large molecule formed of many smaller molecules covalently bonded in a repeating pattern.
The small molecules which make up the polymer are called monomers .
Polymers generally form either from an addition reaction or a condensation reaction.
An addition polymer is a polymer formed by chain addition reactions between monomers that contain a double bond.
Molecules of ethene can polymerize with each other under the right conditions to form the polymer called polyethylene.
Net reaction for the formation of polyethylene
The letter  n stands for the number of monomers that are joined in repeated fashion to make the polymer and can have a value in the hundreds or even thousands.
Mechanism of the synthesis of polyethylene
The reactions above show the basic steps to form an addition polymer:
Initiation - a free radical initiator (X * ) attacks the carbon-carbon double bond (first step above).
The initiator can be something like hydrogen peroxide.
This material can easily split to form two species with a free electron attached to each:
H-O-O-H → 2 H-O•.
This free radical attacks a carbon-carbon double bond.
One of the pi electrons forms a single bond with the initiator while the other pi electron forms a new free radical on the carbon atom.
Propagation - the new free radical compound interacts with another alkene, continuing the process of chain growth (second step above).
Termination occurs whenever two free radicals come in contact with one another (not shown).
The two free electrons form a covalent bond and the free radical on each molecule no longer exists.
Polyethylene can have different properties depending on the length of the polymer chains and on how efficiently they pack together.
Some common products made from different forms of polyethylene include plastic bottles, plastic bags, and harder plastic objects such as milk crates.
