Distance is the length of the route between two points.
The SI unit for distance is the meter.
The scale of a map can be used to find the distance between different locations.
Find an online map tool, like the one at the following URL, that calculates the distance between any two points you select.
Make a list of several pairs of locations between which you want to know the distance.
Use the map scale to estimate the distance between locations in each pair.
Then use the tool to find the actual distances.
What is the SI unit for distance?
Give an example of something you might measure in this unit.
Runners in different lanes on an oval racetrack have different starting marks.
Explain why.
On the map in the Figure above , what is the distance between Jordanâ€™s house and the park?
State the importance of direction as a component of motion.
Use a compass rose to determine direction on a map.
Show how to represent direction and distance with vectors
Imagine traveling several miles in one of the directions indicated by this sign.
Now suppose that a friend travels the same distance in another direction indicated by the sign.
You and your friend would end up in very different locations.
