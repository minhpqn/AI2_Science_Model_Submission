If the half-life of a substance is 5 seconds, it ceases to be radioactive (i.e. it ceases emitting particles), …
… after 5 seconds.
… after 10 seconds
… after 20 seconds.
… after a very long time.
You have 5 grams of radioactive substance A and 5 grams of radioactive substance B.
Both decay by emitting alpha-radiation, and you know that the higher the number of alpha-particles emitted in a given amount of time, the more dangerous the sample is.
Substance A has a short half-life (around 4 days or so) and substance B has a longer half-life (around 10 months or so).
Which substance is more dangerous right now?
Explain.
Which substance will be more dangerous in two years?
Explain.
A certain radioactive material has a half-life of 8 minutes.
Suppose you have a large sample of this material, containing 10^{25} atoms.
How many atoms decay in the first 8 minutes?
Does this strike you as a dangerous release of radiation?
