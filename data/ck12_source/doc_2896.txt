mRNA travels to the ribosome from the nucleus.
The following steps occur in the ribosome:
The base code in the mRNA determines the order of the amino acids in the protein.
The genetic code in mRNA is read in “words” of three letters (triplets), called codons.
Each codon codes for an amino acid.
There are 20 amino acids used to make proteins, and different codons code for different amino acids.
For example, GGU codes for the amino acid glycine, while GUC codes for valine.
tRNA reads the mRNA code and brings a specific amino acid to attach to the growing chain of amino acids.
The anticodon on the tRNA binds to the codon on the mRNA.
Each tRNA carries only one type of amino acid and only recognizes one specific codon.
For example, a GGC anticodon will bind to a CCG codon,  and a CGA anticodon will bind to a GCU codon.
tRNA is released from the amino acid.
Three codons, UGA, UAA, and UAG, indicate that the protein should stop adding amino acids.
They are called stop codons and do not code for an amino acid.
Once tRNA comes to a stop codon, the protein is set free from the ribosome.
The following chart ( Figure below ) is used to determine which amino acids correspond to which codons.
Chart showing which mRNA codon corresponds to which amino acid
This chart shows the genetic code used by all organisms.
For example, an RNA codon reading GUU would encode for a valine (Val) according to this chart.
Start at the center for the first base of the three base codon, and work your way out.
