What does radiation contamination do?
It mutates DNA.
The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on April 26, 1986.
It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.
A Russian publication concludes that 985,000 excess cancers occurred between 1986 and 2004 as a result of radioactive contamination.
The 2011 report of the European Committee on Radiation Risk calculates a total of 1.4 million excess cancers occurred as a result of this contamination.
Causes of Mutation
Mutations have many possible causes.
Some mutations seem to happen spontaneously without any outside influence.
They can occur when mistakes are made during DNA replication or transcription.
Other mutations are caused by environmental factors.
Anything in the environment that can cause a mutation is known as a mutagen .
Examples of mutagens are pictured in Figure below .
