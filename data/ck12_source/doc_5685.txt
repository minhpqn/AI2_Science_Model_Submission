UV light causes suntans at a beach
Do you enjoy going to the beach?
During the summer, almost everyone enjoys going to the beach.
They can swim, have picnics, and work on their tans.
But if you get too much sun, you can burn.
A particular set of solar wavelengths are especially harmful to the skin.
This portion of the soar spectrum is known as UV B, with wavelengths of 280-320 nm.
Sunscreens are effective in protecting the skin against both the immediate skin damage and the long-term possibility of skin cancer.
Waves are characterized by their repetitive motion.
Imagine a toy boat riding the waves in a wave pool.
As the water wave passes under the boat, it moves up and down in a regular and repeated fashion.
While the wave travels horizontally, the boat only travels vertically up and down.
The Figure below shows two examples of waves.
Image showing wavelength, frequency, and amplitude of a wave
(A) A wave consists of alternation crests and troughs.
The wavelength (λ) is defined as the distance between any two consecutive identical points on the waveform.
The amplitude is the height of the wave. (B) A wave with a short wavelength (top) has a high frequency because more waves pass a given point in a certain amount of time.
A wave with a longer wavelength (bottom) has a lower frequency.
A wave cycle consists of one complete wave – starting at the zero point, going up to a wave crest , going back down to a wave trough , and back to the zero point again.
The wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two corresponding points on adjacent waves.
