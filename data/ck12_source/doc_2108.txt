Wind is now used to generate electricity.
Moving air can make a turbine spin, just like moving water can.
Moving air has kinetic energy.
When wind hits the blades of the turbine, the kinetic energy makes the blades move.
The turbine spins and creates electricity.
Wind Power Advantages and Disadvantages
Wind power has many advantages.
It is clean: it does not release pollutants or carbon dioxide.
It is plentiful almost everywhere.
The technology to harness wind energy is being developed rapidly.
Wind power also has problems.
Wind does not blow all of the time, so wind energy must be stored for later use.
Alternatively, another energy source needs to be available when the wind is not blowing.
Wind turbines are expensive.
They can wear out quickly.
Finally, windmills are not welcomed by residents of some locations.
They say that they are unattractive.
Yet even with these problems, wind turbines are a competitive form of renewable energy.
Many states are currently using wind power.
Wind turbines are set up in mountain passes.
