In all these ways, the first plants may have resembled stoneworts.
Stoneworts are similar to Charophyta, which includes the earliest plants
Modern stoneworts may be similar to the earliest plants.
Shown is a field of modern stoneworts (right), and an example from the Charophyta, a division of green algae that includes the closest relatives of the earliest plants (left).
Life on Land
By the time the earliest plants evolved, animals were already the dominant organisms in the ocean.
Plants were also constrained to the upper layer of water that received enough sunlight for photosynthesis.
Therefore, plants never became dominant marine organisms.
But when plants moved onto land, everything was wide open.
Why was the land devoid of other life?
Without plants growing on land, there was nothing for other organisms to feed on.
Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established.
Plants may have colonized the land as early as 700 million years ago.
The oldest fossils of land plants date back about 470 million years.
The first land plants probably resembled modern plants called liverworts , like the one shown in Figure below .
Liverworts are similar to the first land plants
The first land plants may have been similar to liverworts like this one.
Colonization of the land was a huge step in plant evolution.
Until then, virtually all life had evolved in the ocean.
Dry land was a very different kind of place.
