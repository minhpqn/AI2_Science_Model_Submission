Who uses more resources?
It's not hard to tell that the people on the right use more resources than those in the home on the left.
Many natural resources were needed to create a home like this.
Imagine a world in which everybody had equal access to resources.
Some people would have fewer resources than they do now.
But many people would have more.
Whether a resource is available for use depends on several factors.
Supply:
Some resources are very abundant.
Some are rare.
When a resource is close to running out, a replacement needs to be found.
Some resources are very valuable because they are very rare.
Price:
The price of a resource depends on how much of it is available.
It also depends on how easy it is to find and extract.
A resource may not be used until its price goes up enough to cover the costs of finding and extracting it.
Politics:
Resources are not found equally around the world.
Some nations may have a lot of certain vital resources.
Some nations may have none.
