How Terrestrial Arthropods Breathe Air.
Terrestrial arthropods have respiratory structures that let them breathe air.
In the ponds of northern Europe lives a tiny brown spider that spends its entire life underwater.
But just like land spiders, it needs oxygen to breathe.
So, how does this spider breath?
Does it use book lungs?
No.
In fact, aquatic spiders, known as "diving bell spiders," have gills.
Every so often, the spider leaves its underwater web to visit the surface and bring back a bubble of air that sticks to its hairy abdomen.
It deposits the bubble into a little silk air tank.
This "diving bell" is a gill that sucks oxygen from the water, allowing the spider to stay underwater for up to 24 hours.

Arthropods have a life cycle with sexual reproduction.
Most species go through larval stages after hatching.
The larvae are very different from the adults.
They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis .
This may take place within a cocoon.
A familiar example of metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult).
Other arthropod species, in contrast, hatch young that look like small adults.
