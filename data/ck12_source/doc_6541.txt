What is an alkyne?
Can a compound have more than one carbon-carbon double bond in it?
alkene:
A hydrocarbon with one or more carbon-carbon double covalent bonds.
alkyne:
A hydrocarbon with one or more carbon-carbon triple covalent bonds.
unsaturated hydrocarbon:
A hydrocarbon that contains less than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that can possibly bond with the number of carbon atoms present.

What difference does the isomer make?
As we get more into the complexities of organic chemistry, we will see how molecular shape affects reactions.
One common reaction for alkenes is the addition of hydrogen across the double bond to form the corresponding alkane.
Because of the geometry of the reaction, the different 2-butene shapes have different heats of reaction.
These differences are important both from a theoretical standpoint as well as from the point of view of industrial applications.
Greater energy requirements mean a higher cost and a more expensive product.
One of the interesting aspects of organic chemistry is that it is three-dimensional.
A molecule can have a shape in space that may contribute to its properties.
