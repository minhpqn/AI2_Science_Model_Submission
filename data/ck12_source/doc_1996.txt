Diagram of abiotic factors of an ecosystem
Which abiotic factors do you see here?
Biotic factors are the living parts of ecosystems.
They are the species of living things that reside together.
Species, Niche, and Habitat
A species is a unique type of organism.
Members of a species can interbreed and produce offspring that can breed (they are fertile).
Organisms that are not in the same species cannot do this.
Examples of species include humans, lions, and redwood trees.
Can you name other examples?
Each species has a particular way of making a living.
This is called its niche .
You can see the niche of a lion below ( Figure below ).
A lion makes its living by hunting and eating other animals.
Each species also has a certain place where it is best suited to live.
This is called its habitat .
The lionâ€™s habitat is a grassland.
Why is a lion better off in a grassland than in a forest?
Lion hunting a zebra
A lion hunts a water buffalo.
