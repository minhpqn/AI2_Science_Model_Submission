When itâ€™s cold outside, their body temperature drops, and they become very sluggish.
When the outside temperature rises, so does their body temperature, and they are much more active.
What do you think might be some of the pros and cons of ectothermy in amphibians?
Amphibian Organ Systems
All amphibians have digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems.
All three systems share a body cavity called the cloaca.
Wastes enter the cloaca from the digestive and excretory systems, and gametes enter the cloaca from the reproductive system.
An opening in the cloaca allows the wastes and gametes to leave the body.
Amphibians have a relatively complex circulatory system with a three-chambered heart.
Their nervous system is also rather complex, allowing them to interact with each other and their environment.
Amphibians have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals.
Other sense organs include eyes and ears.
Of all amphibians, frogs generally have the best vision and hearing.
Frogs also have a larynx , or voice box, to make sounds.
Most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults.
Additional oxygen is absorbed through the skin in most species.
The skin is kept moist by mucus, which is secreted by mucous glands.
In some species, mucous glands also produce toxins, which help protect the amphibians from predators.
The golden frog shown in Figure below is an example of a toxic amphibian.
