Other human traits have more complex inheritance patterns.
Mendelian inheritance refers to the inheritance of traits controlled by a single gene with two alleles, one of which may be dominant to the other.
Not many human traits are controlled by a single gene with two alleles, but they are a good starting point for understanding human heredity.
How Mendelian traits are inherited depends on whether the traits are controlled by genes on autosomes or the X chromosome.
Autosomal traits are controlled by genes on one of the 22 human autosomes.
Consider earlobe attachment.
A single autosomal gene with two alleles determines whether you have attached earlobes or free-hanging earlobes.
The allele for free-hanging earlobes ( F ) is dominant to the allele for attached earlobes ( f ).
Other single-gene autosomal traits include widow’s peak and hitchhiker’s thumb.
The dominant and recessive forms of these traits are shown in Figure below .
Which form of these traits do you have?
What are your possible genotypes for the traits?
The chart in Figure below is called a pedigree .
It shows how the earlobe trait was passed from generation to generation within a family.
Pedigrees are useful tools for studying inheritance patterns.
You can watch a video explaining how pedigrees are used and what they reveal at this link:  .
Pedigree for earlobe attachment
Having free-hanging earlobes is an autosomal dominant trait.
This figure shows the trait and how it was inherited in a family over three generations.
Shading indicates people who have the recessive form of the trait.
