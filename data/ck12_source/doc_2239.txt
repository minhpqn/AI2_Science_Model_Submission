Beyond the Solar System
To infinity and beyond!
The same tools that are used to study the solar system can be used to study the great beyond.
Tools like the Hubble Space Telescope show astronomers the most amazing things.
Even one century ago, no one knew that there was anything out there beyond our galaxy.
Now we can see fantastic images of other galaxies.
And supernovae and stars and even evidence of black holes.
In this concept, we will explore a tiny bit of what is out there... beyond our solar system... even beyond our galaxy!
This Hubble Space Telescope image is of one of the Universe's most photogenic galaxies, Messier 104.
Explain the difference between apparent and real distances.
Is this pattern of stars meaningful?
This is a constellation, a pattern of stars in the night sky.
This constellation is called Orion.
The features you can see best are his belt and sword.
You can see Orion's belt in the sky from many locations.
These stars are very bright.
For many constellations, the stars are not near each other.
They just happen to appear near each other in our sky.
When you look at the sky on a clear night, you can see hundreds of stars.
A star is a giant ball of glowing gas that is very, very hot.
