Many structures and functions in mammals are related to endothermy .
Mammals can generate and conserve heat when itâ€™s cold outside.
They can also lose heat when they become overheated.
How do mammals control their body temperature in these ways?
How Mammals Stay Warm
Mammals generate heat mainly by keeping their metabolic rate high.
The cells of mammals have many more mitochondria than the cells of other animals.
The extra mitochondria generate enough energy to keep the rate of metabolism high.
Mammals can also generate little bursts of heat by shivering.
Shivering occurs when many muscles contract a little bit all at once.
Each muscle that contracts produces a small amount of heat.
Conserving heat is also important, especially in small mammals.
A small body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size.
Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals.
Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur.
It traps a layer of warm air next to the skin.
Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin, so it becomes an even better insulator.
Even humans automatically contract these muscles when they are cold, causing goosebumps (see Figure below ).
Mammals also have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body.
This fatty layer is not found in other vertebrates.
