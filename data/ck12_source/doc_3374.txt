Basic schematic of a generator
Q:
What might happen to the current produced by an electric generator if the poles of the magnet kept reversing?
A:
The direction of the current would also keep reversing.
In other words, the electric generator would generate alternating current.
From Kinetic to Electrical Energy
Generators may be set up to produce either direct or alternating current.
Generators in cars and most power plants produce alternating current.
Regardless of the type of current, all generators change kinetic energy to electrical energy.
A car generator produces electricity with some of the kinetic energy of the turning crankshaft.
The electricity is used to run the car’s lights, power windows, radio, and other electric devices.
Some of the electricity is stored in the car’s battery to provide electrical energy when the car isn’t running.
A power plant generator produces electricity with the kinetic energy of a turning turbine.
The energy to turn the turbine may come from burning fuel, falling water, or some other energy source.
You can see how falling water is used to generate electricity in a hydroelectric power plant in the Figure below .
Schematic of a dam providing hydroelectric power
Q:
The water flowing through the dam and over the turbine has kinetic energy because it is moving.
Where does the water get the energy to move?
