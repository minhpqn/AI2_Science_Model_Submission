Pancakes require a certain amount of ingredients
Don’t you hate running out of cooking ingredients?
Cooking is a great example of everyday chemistry.
In order to correctly follow a recipe, a cook needs to make sure that he has plenty of all the necessary ingredients in order to make his dish.
Let us suppose that you are deciding to make some pancakes for a large group of people.
The recipe on the box indicates that the following ingredients are needed for each batch of pancakes:
1 cup of pancake mix
\frac{3}{4}  cup milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
Now you check the pantry and the refrigerator and see that you have the following ingredients available:
2 boxes of pancake mix (8 cups)
Half gallon of milk (4 cups)
Full bottle of vegetable oil (about 3 cups)
The question that you must ask is:
How many batches of pancakes can I make?
The answer is two.
Even though you have enough pancake mix, milk, and oil to make many more batches of pancakes, you are limited by the fact that you only have two eggs.
As soon as you have made two batches of pancakes, you will be out of eggs and your “reaction” will be complete.
For a chemist, the balanced chemical equation is the recipe that must be followed.
