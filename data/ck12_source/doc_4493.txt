A muscle fiber either contracts fully or it doesn’t contract at all.
The number of fibers that contract determines the strength of the muscular force.
When more fibers contract at the same time, the force is greater.

Muscles and Nerves
Muscles cannot contract on their own.
They need a stimulus from a nerve cell to “tell” them to contract.
Let’s say you decide to raise your hand in class.
Your brain sends electrical messages to nerve cells, called motor neurons , in your arm and shoulder.
The motor neurons, in turn, stimulate muscle fibers in your arm and shoulder to contract, causing your arm to rise.
Involuntary contractions of cardiac and smooth muscles are also controlled by nerves.
According to the sliding filament theory, a muscle fiber contracts when myosin filaments pull actin filaments closer together and thus shorten sarcomeres within a fiber.
When all the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the fiber contracts.
