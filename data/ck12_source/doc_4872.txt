Eukaryotes include all protists, fungi, plants and animals.
In addition to having a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus and ribosomes, eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles .
Each organelle in a eukaryote has a distinct function.
Because of their complex level of organization, eukaryotic cells can carry out many more functions than prokaryotic cells.
The main differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are shown in Figure below and listed in Table below .
Keep in mind that some eukaryotic cells may have characteristics or features that other eukaryotic cells lack, such as the cell wall.
The main differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
Eukaryotic cells have membrane bound organelles, shown here as a mitochondria, while prokaryotic cells do not.
The nucleoid is the area within the cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell that contains the genetic material.
Eukaryotic cells are about 10 times the size of a typical prokaryote; they range between 10 and 100 µm in diameter while prokaryotes range between 1 and 10 µm in diameter, as shown in Figure below .
Scientists believe that eukaryotes developed about 1.6 – 2.1 billion years ago.
The earliest fossils of multicellular organisms that have been found are 1.2 billion years old.
The relative scale of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
See how eukaryotic cells are generally 10 to 100 times larger than prokaryotic cells.
