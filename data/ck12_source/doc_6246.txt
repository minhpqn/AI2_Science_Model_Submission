Chemical Potential Energy
Define chemical potential energy.
Give examples of chemical potential energy.
Gunpowder contains large quantities of potential energy
Where did gunpowder come from?
Gun powder was originally developed by the Chinese in the ninth century AD, primarily for rockets.
This material is composed of charcoal, sulfur, and saltpeter (potassium nitrate).
The reaction involves the conversion of the charcoal to carbon dioxide with the potassium nitrate providing the extra oxygen needed for a rapid reaction.
Sulfur was included to stabilize the product, but gunpowder is still highly explosive.
Types of Energy
Two basic types of energy exist: potential energy and kinetic energy.
Potential energy is stored energy.
It has not yet been released, but is ready to go.
Kinetic energy is energy of motion.
It causes work to be done through movement.
Chemical Potential Energy
Energy is the capacity for doing work or supplying heat.
When you fill your car with gasoline, you are providing it with potential energy.
Chemical potential energy is the energy stored in the chemical bonds of a substance.
The various chemicals that make up gasoline contain a large amount of chemical potential energy that is released when the gasoline is burned in a controlled way in the engine of the car.
