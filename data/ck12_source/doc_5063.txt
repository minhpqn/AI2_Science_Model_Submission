Note that glycogen and fats can also enter the glycolysis pathway.
The second stage is the Krebs Cycle, and the third stage is the electron transport chain.
It is during the third stage that chemiosmosis produces numerous ATP molecules.

Glycolysis, unlike the latter two stages of cellular respiration, takes place without oxygen in the cytosol (blue) of the cell.
For many organisms, aerobic respiration continues with the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain in the mitochondria (green).
To enter the mitochondria, glucose must first be lysed into smaller molecules.
The name for Stage 1 clearly indicates what happens during that stage: glyco - refers to glucose, and - lysis means "splitting." In glycolysis, within the cytosol of the cell, a minimum of eight different enzymes break apart glucose into two 3-carbon molecules.
The energy released in breaking those bonds is transferred to carrier molecules, ATP and NADH.
NADH temporarily holds small amounts of energy which can be used later to build ATP.
The 3-carbon product of glycolysis is pyruvate , or pyruvic acid ( Figure below ). (The difference between them is actually a sole hydrogen atom.
Pyruvic acid:
CH 3 COCOOH, pyruvate:
CH 3 COCOO - .) Overall, glycolysis can be represented as:
C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2NAD + + 2P i + 2ADP â†’ 2 pyruvate + 2NADH + 2ATP
In glycolysis, glucose (C6) is split into two 3-carbon (C3) pyruvate molecules.
This releases energy, which is transferred to ATP.
How many ATP molecules are made during this stage of cellular respiration?
Glycolysis breaks the 6-carbon molecule glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules, releasing some of the chemical energy which had been stored in glucose.
However, even this equation is deceiving.
