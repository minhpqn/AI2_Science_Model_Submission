The phrase "sides of the ladder" refers to what structure(s)?
Why is there a specific pairing pattern among the bases?
Why are the two strands of the double helix "perfect and specific compliments"?
List three functions of DNA that are based on its structure.
Explain Watson and Crick’s double helix model of DNA.
Explain why complementary base pairing is necessary to maintain the double helix shape of the DNA molecule.
In what direction do the two strands in the DNA backbone run to each other?
What is the four letter code?
DNA Replication - Advanced
Describe how DNA is replicated.
Explain the importance of the fact that during DNA replication, each strand serves as a template to make a complementary DNA strand.
What do you need to copy?
Obviously, you need something to copy.
The same is true for DNA.
To copy or replicate DNA, you use both strands as templates.
DNA replication is the process in which a cell’s entire DNA is copied, or replicated.
The identification of the structure of DNA suggested that each strand of the double helix would serve as a template for synthesis of a new strand.
DNA replication process occurs during the Synthesis (S) phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle.
As each DNA strand has the same genetic information, both strands of the double helix can serve as templates for the reproduction of a complementary new strand.
The two resulting double helices, which each contain one "old" strand and one "new" strand of DNA, are identical to the initial double helix.
