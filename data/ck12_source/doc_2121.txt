It takes millions of years for them to form.
We are using them up much more quickly.
Elements that are used to produce nuclear power are also non-renewable resources.
Uranium, for example, which is rare.
Sooner or later, it will run out.
Supplies of non-renewable resources are shrinking.
This makes them harder to get.
Oil is a good example.
Oil reserves beneath land are running out.
So oil companies have started to drill for oil far out in the ocean.
This costs more money.
Itâ€™s also more dangerous.
Pictured below is an oil rig that exploded in 2010 ( Figure below ).
The explosion killed 11 people.
Millions of barrels of oil spilled into the water.
It took months to plug the leak.
The Deepwater Horizon oil rig on fire
This oil rig was pumping oil from below the ocean floor when it exploded.
Resources may be renewable or non-renewable.
Renewable resources should never run out.
