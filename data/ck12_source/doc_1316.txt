A cross section of earthquake epicenters.
The depth outlines the subducting plate.
There are shallow, intermediate, and deep earthquakes.
Convergent plate boundaries produce earthquakes most of the way around the Pacific Ocean basin.
Earthquakes in Japan are caused by ocean-ocean convergence.
In this part of the Pacific Ocean, oceanic crust subducts beneath oceanic crust.
This creates as many as 1,500 earthquakes every year.
In March 2011, the 9.0 magnitude Tōhoku earthquake struck off of northeastern Japan.
Damage from the quake was severe.
Even more severe was the damage from the tsunami generated by the quake ( Figure below and Figure below ).
A tsunami is an enormous ocean wave or set of waves generated by an underwater earthquake.
In all, 25,000 people were known dead or missing.
The damage caused in Japan from an earthquake and tsunami
The damage in Miyako, Iwate, Japan after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and the massive tsunami it generated struck in March, 2011.

The Pacific Northwest of the United States is at risk from a potentially massive earthquake.
The subduction of three small plates beneath North America produces active volcanoes, the Cascades.
