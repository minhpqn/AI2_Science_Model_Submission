Why was the name Archaeabacteria misleading?
What is bacteriorhodopsin?
What is the role of bacteriorhodopsin in ATP production?
Describe two ways archaea are different from bacteria?
How can archaea reproduction be distinct from bacterial reproduction?
How do most archaea obtain energy?
Types of Archaea
Distinguish between halophiles, thermophiles, and methanogens.
How can termites digest wood?
Unlike us, termites can get nutrition from wood.
Mutualistic archaea found in the gut of termites help them digest the wood.
This is just one example of the many extreme environments in which archaea can thrive.
Types of Archaea
The first archaea described could survive in extremely harsh environments in which no other organisms could survive.
As a result, archaea are often distinguished by the environment in which they live.
The halophiles , which means "salt-loving," live in environments with high levels of salt ( Figure below ).
They have been identified in the Great Salt Lake in Utah and in the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan, which have salt concentrations several times that of the oceans.
Halophiles, like the Halobacterium shown here, require high salt concentrations
Halophiles, like the Halobacterium shown here, require high salt concentrations.
The thermophiles live in extremely hot environments.
