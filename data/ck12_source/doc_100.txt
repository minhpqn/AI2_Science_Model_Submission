Snakes’ eyelids are transparent “spectacle” scales which remain permanently closed.
Most snakes are not venomous, but some have venom capable of causing painful injury or death to humans.
However, snake venom is primarily used for killing prey rather than for self-defense.
Snakes that are kept as pets can have their venom removed without affecting the health of the snake.

Most snakes use specialized belly scales, which grip surfaces to move ( Figure below ).
In the shedding of scales, known as molting , the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer ( Figure below ).
Molting replaces old and worn skin, allows the snake to grow, and helps it get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks.

Although different snake species reproduce in different ways, all snakes use internal fertilization, where fertilization of the egg takes place inside the female.
The male uses sex organs stored in its tail to transfer sperm to the female.
Most species of snakes lay eggs, and most species abandon these eggs shortly after laying them.
How do Snakes Eat?
All snakes are strictly carnivorous, eating small animals including lizards, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails, or insects.
Because snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces, prey must be swallowed whole.
