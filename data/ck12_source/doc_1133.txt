Rotation of Earth
Describe Earth's rotation on its axis.
Explain the day-night cycle.
How do you know Earth rotates?
Something amazing happens every day (unless you live very far north or very far south)!
The amazing thing is that the Sun rises in the east.
It also sets in the west.
We know that the Sun doesn't actually move around Earth.
What causes the Sun to rise and set is that Earth rotates on its axis.
This rotation creates day and night.
