Water levels in wells may fluctuate.
This is because water may move into or out of fractures before an earthquake.
This is also an uncertain way to predict an earthquake.
The difference in arrival times of P-waves and S-waves may decrease just before an earthquake occurs.
Folklore tells of animals behaving strangely just before an earthquake.
Most people tell stories of these behaviors after the earthquake.
Chinese scientists have actively studied the behavior of animals before earthquakes to see if there is a connection.
So far nothing concrete has come of these studies.
Actions can reduce the damage once an earthquake has started.
Seismometers can detect P-waves a few seconds before more damaging S-waves and surface waves arrive.
In this time computers can shut down gas mains and electrical transmission lines.
They can initiate protective measures in chemical plants, nuclear power plants, mass transit systems, airports, and roadways.
Just a few seconds can be tremendously valuable.
A good prediction must indicate when and where an earthquake will take place.
Fault segments behave the same way over time.
Signs that an earthquakes may occur include foreshocks, ground tilting, water levels in wells, and the relative arrival times of P- and S-waves.
