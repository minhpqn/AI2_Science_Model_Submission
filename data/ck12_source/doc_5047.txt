The enzyme that combines one molecule of CO 2 with a 5-carbon sugar called ribulose biphosphate (RuBP); the most abundant enzyme on earth.
stomata (singular, stoma ):
Openings on the underside of a leaf which allow gas exchange and transpiration.
transpiration :
A process by which plants lose water; occurs when stomata in leaves open to take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and lose water to the atmosphere in the process.
The Calvin Cycle uses the NADPH and ATP from the Light Reactions to “fix” carbon and produce glucose.
Carbon dioxide enters the Calvin Cycle when Rubisco attaches it to a 5-carbon sugar.
Most plants fix CO 2 directly with the Calvin Cycle, so they are called C-3 plants.
Some plants have evolved preliminary fixation pathways, which help them conserve water in hot, dry habitats.
C-4 plants use a 3-carbon carrier to compartmentalize initial carbon fixation in order to concentrate CO 2 before sending it on to Rubisco.
CAM plants open their stomata for preliminary CO 2 fixation only at night.
In the Calvin Cycle, the fixed CO 2 moves through a series of chemical reactions, gaining a small amount of energy from ATP or NADPH at each step.
Six turns of the cycle process 6 molecules of carbon dioxide and 12 hydrogens to produce a single molecule of glucose.
Match the major events with the stage of photosynthesis (Light Reactions or Calvin Cycle) in which they occur.
Carbon dioxide is fixed.
Electrons in chlorophyll jump to higher energy levels.
Glucose is produced.
NADPH and ATP are produced.
NADPH and ATP are used.
Oxygen gas is released.
