Some protein molecules consist of multiple protein subunits.
The quaternary structure of a protein refers to the specific interaction and orientation of the subunits of that protein Hemoglobin is a very large protein found in red blood cells and whose function is to bind and carry oxygen throughout the bloodstream.
Hemoglobin consists of four subunits – two α subunits (yellow) and two β subunits (gray) – which then come together in a specific and defined way through interactions of the side chains (see Figure below ).
Hemoglobin also contains four iron atoms, located in the middle of each of the four subunits.
The iron atoms are part of a structure called a porphyrin, shown in red in the figure.

Some proteins consist of only one subunit and thus do not have a quaternary structure.
The Figure below diagrams the interaction of the four levels of protein structure.
