A condensation polymer is a polymer formed by condensation reactions.
Monomers of condensation polymers must contain two functional groups so that each monomer can link up with two other monomers.
One type of condensation polymer is called a polyamide.
An amide is characterized by the functional group shown below wherein the carbon of a carbonyl group is bonded to the nitrogen of an amine.
Structure of an amide
One pair of monomers that can form a polyamide is adipic acid and hexanediamine.
Adipic acid is a carboxylic acid with two carboxyl groups on either end of the molecule.
Hexanediamine has amino groups on either end of a six-carbon chain.
When these molecules react with each other, a molecule of water is eliminated, classifying it as a condensation reaction ( Figure below ).
Example of a condensation reaction to form a polyamide
The polymer that results from the repetition of the condensation reaction is a polyamide called nylon-66.
Nylon-66 was first invented in 1935 and has been used in all sorts of products.
It and other polyamides are commonly found in fibers and clothing, cooking utensils, fishing line, and carpeting, among many other applications.
Nylon-66 is a commonly used polymer
Polyester is another common type of condensation polymer.
Recall that esters are formed from the reaction of an alcohol with a carboxylic acid.
When both the acid and alcohol have two functional groups, the ester is capable of being polymerized.
One such polyester is called polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and is formed from the reaction of ethylene glycol with terephthalic acid.
The structure of PET is shown below.
