Mercalli Intensity Scale depends on many factors other than the amount of energy released in the earthquake.
These factors include the type of rock in the region.
They also include the quality of the structures built in the area.
The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake.
The moment magnitude scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the total amount of energy released by an earthquake.
