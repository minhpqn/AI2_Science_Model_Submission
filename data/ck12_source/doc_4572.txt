Well, that's exactly what the large intestine does.
It takes the remains of digested food â€” that is, food in which all the nutrients and minerals have been removed, and prepares it for elimination.
The Large Intestine and Its Functions
From the small intestine, any remaining food wastes pass into the large intestine.
The large intestine is a relatively wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus.
Like the small intestine, the large intestine also consists of three parts: the cecum (or caecum), colon, and rectum.

Absorption of Water and Elimination of Wastes
The cecum is the first part of the large intestine, where wastes enter from the small intestine.
The wastes are in a liquid state.
As they pass through the colon , which is the second part of the large intestine, excess water is absorbed.
The remaining solid wastes are called feces .
Feces accumulate in the rectum , which is the third part of the large intestine.
As the rectum fills, the feces become compacted.
After a certain amount of feces accumulate, they are eliminated from the body.
