Starch is made up of a mixture of amylose (15–20%) and amylopectin (80–85%).
Amylose consists of a linear chain of several hundred glucose molecules and amylopectin is a branched molecule made of several thousand glucose units.
Starches can be digested by hydrolysis reactions , catalyzed by enzymes called amylases , which can break the glycosidic bonds.
Humans and other animals have amylases, so they can digest starches.
Potato, rice, wheat, and maize are major sources of starch in the human diet.
The formations of starches are the ways that plants store glucose.
Glycogen is sometimes referred to as animal starch.
Glycogen is used for long-term energy storage in animal cells.
Glycogen is made primarily by the liver and the muscles.
The main functions of polysaccharides are to store energy and form structural tissues.
Examples of several other polysaccharides and their roles are listed in the Table below .
These complex carbohydrates play important roles in living organisms.

Biofuels:
From Sugar to Energy
For years there's been buzz – both positive and negative – about generating ethanol fuel from corn.
But thanks to recent developments, the Bay Area of California is rapidly becoming a world center for the next generation of green fuel alternatives.
The Joint BioEnergy Institute is developing methods to isolate biofeuls from the sugars in cellulose.
