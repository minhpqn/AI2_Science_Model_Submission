What do you get when you take energy, nutrients and other resources, biomes and their populations, and all the species and their relationships?
You get ecology.
Understanding ecology is in part understanding the biology of our planet.
And it can easily be argued that this is especially important today.
We literally hold the future of our planet in our hands.
The lessons in this concept discuss ecology, and all the related aspects that comprise the ecosystem.
Introduction to Ecology
Compare field studies to laboratory studies.
Distinguish between abiotic and biotic factors.
Do organisms live in isolation?
No, organisms are not separated from their environment or from other organisms.
They interact in many ways with their surroundings.
For example, these deer may be drinking from this stream or eating nearby plants.
Ecology is the study of these interactions.
Introduction to Ecology
Life Science can be studied at many different levels.
You can study small things like cells.
Or you can study big things like a group of animals.
You can also study the biosphere, which is any area in which organisms live.
The study of the biosphere is part of ecology , the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment.
