Explain why organisms need enzymes to survive.
Summarize the importance of enzymes to living organisms.
Define substrate and active site.
Describe how enzymes function.
Differentiate between a biochemical reaction in the presence or absence of an enzyme.
Describe the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity.
Do cells have one enzyme with lots of functions, or many enzymes, each with just one function?
Enzymes.
Magical proteins necessary for life.
So how do enzymes work?
How do they catalyze just one specific biochemical reaction?
In a puzzle, only two pieces will fit together properly.
Understanding that is one of the main steps in understanding how enzymes work.
How do enzymes speed up biochemical reactions so dramatically?
Like all catalysts , enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions.
Activation energy is the energy needed to start a chemical reaction.
This is illustrated in Figure below .
The biochemical reaction shown in the figure requires about three times as much activation energy without the enzyme as it does with the enzyme.
