Most hydrogen atoms lack a neutron and are just called hydrogen.
Hydrogen atoms with one neutron are the isotope known as deuterium, and those with two neutrons are the isotope named tritium.
For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number, which is the number of protons plus neutrons.
For example, carbon with a mass number of 14 is called carbon-14.
Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus.
If they have too many or too few neutrons relative to protons, they are radioactive and will decay to more stable forms.
Isotopes with radioactive nuclei are called radioisotopes.

How does carbon-14 form?
Carbon-14 slowly decays over time because it is radioactive.
Why does the percent of carbon-14 remain the same in living organisms?
How can the percent of carbon-14 in a dead organism be used to estimate the amount of time that has passed since the organism died?
What are isotopes?
Why do different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties?
Describe the three isotopes of hydrogen.
Relate the concepts of isotope and mass number.
All oxygen atoms have eight protons, and most have eight neutrons as well.
What is the mass number of an oxygen isotope that has nine neutrons?
