Some of the damage done by storms is from storm surge .
Low pressure in a storm pulls water upward.
Water piles up at a shoreline as storm winds push waves into the coast.
Storm surge may raise sea level as much as 7.5 m (25 ft).
This can be devastating in a shallow land area when winds, waves, and rain are intense.

Maverick waves are massive.
Learning how they are generated can tell scientists a great deal about how the ocean creates waves and especially large waves.

The largest wind waves are built when a strong wind blows for a long time over a large area.
It is not the water that travels in a wave; it is the energy that is transferred from where the wave formed.
A wave breaks when it is too tall to be supported by its base.
This is common as a wave moves up the shore.
