A:
No, they could not.
In an ionic compound, the positive metal ion is always written first, followed by the negative nonmetal ion.
Therefore, A and C must always come first, followed by D or B.
An example of a double replacement reaction is sodium chloride (NaCl) reacting with silver fluoride (AgF).
This reaction is represented by the equation:
NaCl + AgF → NaF + AgCl
During the reaction, chloride and fluoride ions change places, so two new compounds are formed in the products: sodium fluoride (NaF) and silver chloride (AgCl).

Q:
When iron sulfide (FeS) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) react together, a double replacement reaction occurs.
What are the products of this reaction?
What is the chemical equation for this reaction?
A:
The products of the reaction are iron chloride (FeCl 2 ) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S).
The chemical equation for this reaction is:
FeS + 2HCl → H 2 S + FeCl 2
A replacement reaction occurs when elements switch places in compounds.
This type of reaction involves ions.
Generally, more reactive elements replace less reactive elements.
