Lightning during a thunderstorm
Lightning flashes during a thunderstorm
The downdrafts cool the air at the base of the cloud.
The air is no longer warm enough to rise.
Convection shuts down and the thunderhead runs out of energy.
A thunderstorm usually ends only 15 to 30 minutes after it begins.
New thunderstorms may start in the same area.
Many thunderstorms form individually.
During some seasons, they form in squall lines , long lines of thunderstorms, along a cold front.
Squall lines form in spring and early summer in the Midwestern United States.
This is because the maritime tropical (mT) air mass from the Gulf of Mexico meets the continental polar (cP) air mass from Canada ( Figure below ).
Map of a squall line
Cold air from the Rockies collided with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to form this squall line.
An online guide to severe storms from the University of Illinois is found here:
Thunderstorms grow where ground temperatures are extremely high.
Convection in the cloud causes raindrops or hailstones to grow.
Downdrafts ultimately end convection.
Squall lines are long lines of thunderstorms that form along a cold front.
