Plug n’ Chug: f = \frac{v} {\lambda} = \frac{6.0 \ m/s}{28 \ m} = 0.21 \ Hz
Answer: \boxed{\mathbf{0.21 \ Hz}}
Question b :
T = ? [s]
Given: f = 0.21 \ Hz
Equation:
T = \frac{1}{f}
Plug n’ Chug:
T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.21 \ Hz} = 4.76 \ s
Answer: \boxed{\mathbf{4.76 \ s}}

Bored in class, you start tapping your finger on the table.
Your friend, sitting right next to you also starts tapping away.
But while you are tapping once every second, you’re friend taps twice for every one tap of yours.
What is the Period and frequency of your tapping?
What is the Period and frequency of your friend’s tapping?
Your tapping starts small waves going down the desk.
Sort of like hitting a bell with a hammer.
The frequency of the sound you hear is 1200 Hz.
You know the wave speed in wood is about 3600 m/s.
