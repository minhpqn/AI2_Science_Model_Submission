The key shows which food group each color represents.
Which colored band of MyPyramid is widest?
Which food group does it represent?
In MyPyramid, each food group is represented by a band of a different color.
For example, grains are represented by an orange band, and vegetables are represented by a green band.
The wider the band, the more foods you should choose from that food group each day.
The orange band in MyPyramid is the widest band.
This means that you should choose more foods from the grain group than from any other single food group.
The green, blue, and red bands are also relatively wide.
Therefore, you should choose plenty of foods from the vegetable, dairy, and fruit groups as well.
You should choose the fewest foods from the food group with the narrowest band.

Are you wondering where foods like ice cream, cookies, and potato chips fit into MyPyramid?
The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods such as these.
These are foods that should be eaten only in very small amounts and not very often.
Such foods contain very few nutrients and are called nutrient-poor.
Instead, they are high in fats, sugars, and sodium, which are nutrients that you should limit in a healthy eating plan.
Ice cream, cookies, and potato chips are also high in calories.
Eating too much of them may lead to unhealthy weight gain.
