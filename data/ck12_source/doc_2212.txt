The planet has recently been discovered.
It is the size of Neptune and orbits its star every 2.6 days.
Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered other solar systems.
A solar system has one or more planets orbiting one or more stars.
We call these planets “extrasolar planets,” or exoplanets .
They are called exoplanets because they orbit a star other than the Sun.
As of April 2014, more than 4,600 exoplanets have been found, with 1706 confirmed.
The rate of discovery is increasing rapidly!

Exoplanets are very far away, and they are relatively tiny.
So we have been able to take pictures of only a few exoplanets.
Most are discovered because of some tell-tale signs.
One sign is a very slight motion of a star that must be caused by the pull of a planet.
An animation showing how this looks is seen here from above: .
This is in line with the plane of the system:
Another sign is the partial dimming of a star’s light as the planet passes in front of it.
If life exists elsewhere in the Universe, it is almost certainly on an exoplanet.
Which exoplanets could have life?
