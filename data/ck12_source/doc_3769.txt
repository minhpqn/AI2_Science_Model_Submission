The First Cells
What was needed for the first cell?
Some sort of membrane surrounding organic molecules?
Probably.
How organic molecules such as RNA developed into cells is not known for certain.
Scientists speculate that lipid membranes grew around the organic molecules.
The membranes prevented the molecules from reacting with other molecules, so they did not form new compounds.
In this way, the organic molecules persisted, and the first cells may have formed.
Figure below shows a model of the hypothetical first cell.
Were these first cells the first living organisms?
Were they able to live and reproduce while passing their genetic information to the next generation?
If so, then yes, these first cells could be considered the first living organisms.
Hypothetical first cell on Earth
Hypothetical First Cell.
The earliest cells may have consisted of little more than RNA inside a lipid membrane.
No doubt there were many early cells of this type.
However, scientists think that only one early cell (or group of cells) eventually gave rise to all subsequent life on Earth.
That one cell is called the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).
It probably existed around 3.5 billion years ago.
LUCA was one of the earliest prokaryotic cells .
