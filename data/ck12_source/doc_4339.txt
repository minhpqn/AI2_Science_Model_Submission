They live in marine, freshwater, terrestrial, and aerial habitats.
They can be found from the equator to the poles.
Several examples of chordates are pictured in Figure below .

Diversity of Chordates.
These six species illustrate the diversity of the phylum Chordata.
Characteristics of Chordates
Chordates have three embryonic cell layers.
They also have a segmented body with a coelom and bilateral symmetry.
Chordates have a complete digestive system and a closed circulatory system.
Their nervous system is centralized.
There are four additional traits that are unique to chordates.
These four traits, shown in Figure below , define the chordate phylum.
Post-anal tail :
The tail is opposite the head and extends past the anus.
Dorsal hollow nerve cord :
The nerve cord runs along the top, or dorsal, side of the animal. (In non chordate animals, the nerve cord is solid and runs along the bottom).
Notochord :
The notochord lies between the dorsal nerve cord and the digestive tract.
