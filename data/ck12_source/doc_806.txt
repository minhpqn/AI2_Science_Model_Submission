This increases the population size and growth rate.
Emigration is the movement of individuals out of a population.
This decreases the population size and growth rate.
The earlier growth rate equation can be modified to account for migration: growth rate = (birth rate + immigration rate) â€“ (death rate + emigration rate).
One type of migration that you are probably familiar with is the migration of birds.
Maybe you have heard that birds fly south for the winter.
In the fall, birds fly thousands of miles to the south where it is warmer.
In the spring, they return to their homes. ( Figure below ).
Monarch butterflies also migrate from Mexico to the northern U.S. in the summer and back to Mexico in the winter.
These types of migrations move entire populations from one location to another.
A flock of barnacle geese fly in formation during the autumn migration.
Population growth can be described with two models, based on the size of the population and necessary resources.
These two types of growth are known as exponential growth and logistic growth.
If a population is given unlimited amounts of resources, such as food and water, land if needed, moisture, oxygen, and other environmental factors, it will grow exponentially.
Exponential growth occurs as a population grows larger, dramatically increasing the growth rate.
This is shown as a "J-shaped" curve below ( Figure below ).
You can see that the population grows slowly at first, but as time passes, growth occurs more and more rapidly.
Growth of populations according to exponential (or J-curve) growth model ( left ) and logistic (or S-curve) growth model ( right ).
Time is plotted on the x-axis, and population size is plotted on the y-axis.
In nature, organisms do not usually have ideal environments with unlimited food.
