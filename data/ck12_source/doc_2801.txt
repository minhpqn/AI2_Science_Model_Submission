Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when acids come into contact with them, so indicators can be used to detect acids.
An example of an indicator is the compound called litmus.
It is placed on small strips of paper that may be red or blue.
If you place a few drops of acid on a strip of blue litmus paper, the paper will turn red.
You can see this in the Figure below .
Litmus isnâ€™t the only indicator for detecting acids.
Red cabbage juice also works well, as you can see in this entertaining video:
