Some viruses live in a dormant state inside the body.
This is called latency .
For example, the virus that causes chicken pox may infect a young child and cause the short-term disease chicken pox.
Then the virus may remain latent in nerve cells within the body for decades.
The virus may re-emerge later in life as the disease called shingles.
In shingles, the virus causes painful skin rashes with blisters (see Figure below ).
