Sharks continually shed and replace their teeth, with some shedding as much as 35,000 teeth in a lifetime.
The sharks, rays, and skates (which are similar to stingrays) are further broken into two superorders:
Rays and skates.
Sharks are some of the most frequently studied cartilaginous fish.
Sharks are distinguished by such features as:
The number of gill slits.
The number and type of fins.
The type of teeth.
The size of their jaws.
Their activity at night.
An elongated, toothed snout used for slashing the fish that they eat, as seen in sawsharks.
Teeth used for grasping and crushing shellfish, a characteristic of bullhead sharks.
A whisker-like organ named barbels that help sharks find food, a characteristic of carpet sharks.
A long snout (or nose-like area), characteristic of groundsharks.
Ovoviviparous reproduction, where the eggs develop inside the motherâ€™s body after internal fertilization, and the young are born alive.
This trait is characteristic of mackerel sharks.
All sharks mate by internal fertilization.
Some sharks then lay their eggs, others allow internal development.
