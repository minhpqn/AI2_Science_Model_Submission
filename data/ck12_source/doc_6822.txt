Flatworms have a ladder-like nervous system; two interconnected parallel nerve cords run the length of the body.
Most flatworms have a distinct head region that includes nerve cells and sensory organs, such as eyespots.
The development of a head region, called cephalization , evolved at the same time as bilateral symmetry in animals.  This process does not occur in cnidarians, which evolved prior to flatworms and have radial symmetry.
Marine flatworms can be brightly colored
Marine flatworms can be brightly colored, such as this one from the class Turbellaria.
These worms are mostly carnivores or scavengers.
Flatworms in the Environment
Flatworms live in a variety of environments.
Some species of flatworms are free-living organisms that feed on small organisms and rotting matter.
These types of flatworms include marine flatworms and freshwater flatworms, such as Dugesia .
Other types of flatworms are parasitic.
That means they live inside another organism, called a host, in order to get the food and energy they need.
For example, tapeworms have a head-like area with tiny hooks and suckers (known as the scolex ) that help the worm attach to the intestines of an animal host ( Figure below ).
There are over 11,000 species of parasitic flatworms.
Tapeworms are parasitic flatworms that live in the intestines of their hosts
Tapeworms are parasitic flatworms that live in the intestines of their hosts.
They can be very long ( left ).
Tapeworms attach to the intestinal wall with a head region that has hooks and suckers ( right ).
The majority of flatworms are parasites.
Flatworms have no true body cavity and no blood vessels.
