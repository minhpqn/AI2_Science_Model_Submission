Record flow in the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers has to go somewhere.
Normal spring river levels are shown in 2010.
The flooded region in the image from May 3, 2011 is the New Madrid Floodway, where overflow water is meant to go. 2011 is the first time since 1927 that this floodway was used.
Buffers to Flooding
Heavily vegetated lands are less likely to experience flooding.
Plants slow down water as it runs over the land, giving it time to enter the ground.
If the ground is too wet to absorb more water, plants still slow the waterâ€™s passage.
Slower water keeps all the water from entering the stream at once.
Wetlands play a key role in minimizing the impacts of floods.
Wetlands act as a buffer between land and high water levels.
Flooding is often more severe in areas that have been recently logged.
People protect areas that might flood with dams.
In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ).
Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break.
In that case, flooding can be catastrophic.
Flood waters can also overflow a dam.
People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods.
These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods.
Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere.
For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream.
