The ozone in smog may damage plants.
The effects of ozone add up over time.
Plants such as trees, which normally live a long time, are most affected.
Entire forests may die out if ozone levels are very high.
Other plants, including crop plants, may also be damaged by ozone.
Below, you can see evidence of ozone damage ( Figure below ).
Ozone damaged leaves on a bean plant
Ozone damaged snap bean plants are shown on the left.
Healthy snap bean plants are shown on the right.
The ozone in smog is also harmful to human health.
The image below shows the levels of ozone to watch out for ( Figure below ).
Some people are especially sensitive to ozone.
They can be harmed by levels of ozone that would not affect most other people.
These people include those with lung or heart problems.

The ozone air quality index gives the parts of ozone per million parts of air.

Nitrogen and Sulfur Oxides
Both nitrogen and sulfur oxides are toxic to humans.
These compounds can cause lung diseases or make them worse.
