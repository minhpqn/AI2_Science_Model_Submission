Describe the influence of temperature on the solubility of gases in water.
When the temperature of water increases, the amount of dissolved oxygen decreases, which can kill fish
What happens to the fish in the water next to a nuclear power plant?
Nuclear power plants require large amounts of water to generate steam for the turbines and to cool the equipment.
They will usually be situated near bodies of water to use that water as a coolant, returning the warmer water back to the lake or river.
This increases the overall temperature of the water, which lowers the quantity of dissolved oxygen, affecting the survival of fish and other organisms.
How Temperature Influences Solubility
The solubility of a substance is the amount of that substance that is required to form a saturated solution in a given amount of solvent at a specified temperature.
Solubility is often measured as the grams of solute per 100 g of solvent.
The solubility of sodium chloride in water is 36.0 g per 100 g water at 20Â°C.
The temperature must be specified because solubility varies with temperature.
For gases, the pressure must also be specified.
Solubility is specific for a particular solvent.
We will consider solubility of material in water as solvent.
The solubility of the majority of solid substances increases as the temperature increases.
However, the effect is difficult to predict and varies widely from one solute to another.
The temperature dependence of solubility can be visualized with the help of a solubility curve , a graph of the solubility vs. temperature (see Figure below ).
Solubility curve of many compounds
Solubility curves for several compounds.
Notice how the temperature dependence of NaCl is fairly flat, meaning that an increase in temperature has relatively little effect on the solubility of NaCl.
