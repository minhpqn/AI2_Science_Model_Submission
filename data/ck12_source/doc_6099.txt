This heat is then dissipated through the coils into the outside air.
As the compressed gas is pumped through the system again, the process repeats itself.
Combined Gas Law
To this point, we have examined the relationships between any two of the variables of P , V , and T , while the third variable is held constant.
However, situations arise where all three variables change.
The combined gas law expresses the relationship between the pressure, volume, and absolute temperature of a fixed amount of gas.
For a combined gas law problem, only the amount of gas is held constant.
\frac{P \times V}{T}=k \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{P_1 \times V_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2 \times V_2}{T_2}
Sample Problem:
Combined Gas Law
2.00 L of a gas at 35Â°C and 0.833 atm is brought to standard temperature and pressure (STP).
What will be the new gas volume?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
P_1=0.833 \text{ atm}
V_1=2.00 \text{ L}
T_1=35^\circ \text{C}=308 \text{ K}
P_2=1.00 \text{ atm}
T_2=0^\circ \text{C}=273 \text{ K}
V_2=? \text{ L}
