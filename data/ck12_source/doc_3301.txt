A positively charged balloon will attract negatively charged hair
Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.
Watch the animation “Balloons and Static Electricity” at the following URL to see how electrons are transferred by friction between a sweater and a balloon.
Q:
If you rub a balloon against a wall, it may stick to the wall.
Explain why.
A:
Electrons are transferred from the wall to the balloon, making the balloon negatively charged and the wall positively charged.
The balloon sticks to the wall because opposite charges attract.
Whenever electrons are transferred between objects, neutral matter becomes charged.
For example, when atoms lose or gain electrons they become charged particles called ions.
Three ways electrons can be transferred are conduction, friction, and polarization.
In each case, the total charge remains the same.
This is the law of conservation of charge.
Conduction occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.
Polarization is the movement of electrons within a neutral object due to the electric field of a nearby charged object.
It occurs without direct contact between the two objects.
Electrons are transferred whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.
At the following URL, review how charges are transferred through friction.
