Distinguish between a transition and a transversion.
Mutations Types - Advanced
Describe common types of mutations, including three common types of point mutations.
Illustrate common chromosomal alterations.
Discuss potential outcomes of point mutations.
Discuss consequences of effect-on-function mutations.
Obviously this is not very common.
But it is not that uncommon, with an incidence of about 1 in 500 live births.
Known as polydactyly, this phenotype has been associated with over 35 genetic mutations.
Types of Mutations
Mutations, a change in the DNA or RNA sequence, may have no effect, may be beneficial or may be harmful.
There are numerous ways that the genetic information can be changed.
Some of these changes can be inherited.
In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations , which can be passed on to descendants, and somatic mutations , which cannot be transmitted to the next generation.
Germline mutations change the DNA sequence within a sperm or egg cell, and therefore can be inherited.
This inherited mutation may result in a class of diseases known as a genetic disease.
The mutation may lead to a nonfunctional protein, and the embryo may not develop properly or survive.
Somatic mutations may affect the proper functioning of the cell with the mutation.
During DNA replication, the mutation will be copied.
The two daughter cells formed after cell division will both carry the mutation.
