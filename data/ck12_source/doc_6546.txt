The Figure below shows two possibilities for the puckered cyclohexane molecule.
Each of the structures is called a conformation.
The conformation on the right is called the boat conformation, while the one on the left is called the chair conformation.
Chair and boat conformations of cyclohexane
Chair (left) and boat (right) conformations for cyclohexane.
While both conformations reduce the ring strain compared to a planar molecule, the chair is preferred.
This is because the chair conformation results in fewer repulsive interactions between the hydrogen atoms.
However, interconversion readily occurs between the two conformations.
Larger cycloalkanes also exist, but are less common.
Cyclic hydrocarbons may also be unsaturated.
A cycloalkene is a cyclic hydrocarbon with at least one carbon-carbon double bond.
A cycloalkyne is a cyclic hydrocarbon with at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.
Shown below are the simplified structural formulas for cyclohexene and cyclooctyne.
