In neo -pentane (see Figure below ), two carbon atoms branch off from the main chain.
n-pentane is a straight chain isomer of pentane
Isopentane is a branched isomer of pentane
Neopentane is an isomer of pentane with four carbons attached to the center carbon
How Many Isomers?
Butane has only two isomers and pentane has just three, but some hydrocarbons have many more isomers than these.
As you increase the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, the number of isomers quickly increases.
For example, heptane, with seven carbon atoms, has nine isomers; and dodecane, with twelve carbon atoms, has 355 isomers.
Some hydrocarbons with many more carbon atoms have billions of isomers!
Q:
Why does the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon determine how many isomers it has?
A:
The more carbon atoms there are, the greater the number of possible arrangements of carbon atoms.
Properties of Isomers
Because isomers are different compounds, they have different properties.
Generally, branched-chain isomers have lower boiling and melting points than straight-chain isomers.
For example, the boiling and melting points of iso -butane are -12 °C and -160 °C, respectively, compared with 0 °C and -138 °C for n -butane.
The more branching there is, the lower the boiling and melting points are.
Q:
The boiling point of n -pentane is 36 °C.
