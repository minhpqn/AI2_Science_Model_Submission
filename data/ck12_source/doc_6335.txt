For changes in concentration, the system responds in such a way that the value of the equilibrium constant, K_{eq} , is unchanged.
However, a change in temperature shifts the equilibrium and the  K_{eq} value either increases or decreases.
As discussed in the previous section, values of  K_{eq} are dependent on the temperature.
When the temperature of the system for the Haber-Bosch process is increased, the resultant shift in equilibrium towards the reactants means that the  K_{eq} value decreases.
When the temperature is decreased, the shift in equilibrium towards the products means that the  K_{eq} value increases.
Le Châtelier’s principle as related to temperature changes can be illustrated easily by the reaction in which nitrogen tetroxide is in equilibrium with nitrogen dioxide.
\text{N}_2\text{O}_4(g)+ \text{heat} \rightleftarrows 2\text{NO}_2(g)
Dinitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4 ) is colorless, while nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is dark brown in color.
When N 2 O 4 breaks down into NO 2 , heat is absorbed according to the forward reaction above.
Therefore, an increase in temperature of the system will favor the forward reaction.
Conversely, a decrease in temperature will favor the reverse reaction.
