These regions are called magnetic domains .
Generally, the magnetic domains point in different directions, so the material is still not magnetic.
However, the material can be magnetized (made into a magnet) by placing it in a magnetic field.
When this happens, all the magnetic domains line up, and the material becomes a magnet.
You can see this in the Figure below .
Materials that can be magnitized are called ferromagnetic materials .
They include iron, cobalt, and nickel.
Magnetization of domains causes ferromagnetic materials to become magnets
Magnetic domains must be lined up by an outside magnetic field for most ferromagnetic materials to become magnets.
Temporary and Permanent Magnets
Materials that have been magnetized may become temporary or permanent magnets.
If you bring a bar magnet close to pile of paper clips, the paper clips will become temporarily magnetized, as all their magnetic domains line up.
As a result, the paper clips will stick to the magnet and also to each other (see the Figure below ).
However, if you remove the paper clips from the bar magnet’s magnetic field, their magnetic domains will no longer align.
As a result, the paper clips will no longer be magnetized or stick together.
You can follow the five easy steps at the following URL to make a temporary magnet from a paper clip that will retain its magnetism somewhat longer.
A chain of paper clips held up by magnetism
If you stroke an iron nail with a bar magnet, the nail will become a permanent (or at least long-lasting) magnet.
You can see how it’s done in the Figure below .
The nail’s magnetic domains will remain aligned even after you remove the nail from the magnetic field of the bar magnet.
