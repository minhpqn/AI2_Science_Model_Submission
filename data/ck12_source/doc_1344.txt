If a similar quake struck today, how many fatalities would there be compared with the quake in 1964?
Explain your reasoning.
Why do city planners look at Mercali maps rather than predictions of earthquake magnitude?
Earthquake Safe Structures
Identify steps that can be taken to make buildings safer and avoid fires in earthquake-prone areas.
Why is California Memorial Stadium called a "tectonic time bomb"?
The California Memorial Stadium is the home of football at the University of California, Berkeley.
The site probably looked flat and easy to build on in 1922.
But now scientists know that the Hayward Fault passes directly beneath both end zones.
The stadium has been renovated in a $321 million project.
The renovation involved 10 miles of steel cables, silicone fluid-filled shock absorbers, concrete piers, 3-feet of sand, plastic sheeting, and stone columns.
Go Bears!
New construction can be made safer in many ways:
Skyscrapers and other large structures built on soft ground must be anchored to bedrock.
Sometimes the bedrock lies hundreds of meters below the ground surface.
The correct building materials must be used.
Houses should bend and sway.
Wood and steel are better than brick, stone, and adobe, which are brittle and will break.
Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch nearby buildings.
Counterweights and diagonal steel beams are used to hold down sway.
