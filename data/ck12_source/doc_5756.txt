This makes them very reactive.
Q:
Why does having just one valence electron make group 1 elements very reactive?
A:
With just one valence electron, group 1 elements are “eager” to lose that electron.
Doing so allows them to achieve a full outer energy level and maximum stability.
Reactivity of Group 1 Elements
Hydrogen is a very reactive gas, and the alkali metals are even more reactive.
In fact, they are the most reactive metals and, along with the elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements.
The reactivity of alkali metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium (Fr) is the most reactive.
Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in combination with other elements.
They often combine with group 17 elements, which are very “eager” to gain an electron.

Other Properties of Alkali Metals
Besides being very reactive, alkali metals share a number of other properties.
Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature.
Alkali metals are low in density, and some of them float on water.
Alkali metals are relatively soft.
Some are even soft enough to cut with a knife, like the sodium pictured in the Figure below .
