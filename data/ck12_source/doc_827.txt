Habitat and Niche
Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem.
A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem.
In other words, a niche is how an organism “makes a living.” A niche will include the organism's role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem.
This involves how the organism gets its energy, which usually has to do with what an organism eats, and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem, which has to do with what eats the organism.
An organism's niche also includes how the organism interacts with other organisms, and its role in recycling nutrients.
Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position.
For example when the Tarpan, a small wild horse found mainly in southern Russia, became extinct in the early 1900s, its niche was filled by a small horse breed, the Konik ( Figure below ).
Often this occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche.
When the Tarpan horse breed became extinct, the Konik horse breed occupied its niche in the ecosystem

A species' niche must be specific to that species; no two species can fill the same niche.
They can have very similar niches, which can overlap, but there must be distinct differences between any two niches.
If two species do fill the same niche, they will compete for all necessary resources.
One species will out compete the other, forcing the other species to adapt or risk extinction.
This is known as competitive exclusion.
When plants and animals are introduced, either intentionally or by accident, into a new environment, they can occupy the existing niches of native organisms.
Sometimes new species out-compete native species, and the native species may go extinct.
They can then become a serious pest.
For example, kudzu, a Japanese vine, was planted in the southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss.
