Single-celled organisms are able to carry out all the processes of life without help from other cells.
Multicellular organisms carry out their life processes through division of labor.
They have specialized cells that do specific jobs.
The Colonial Theory proposes that cooperation among cells of the same species led to the development of a multicellular organism.
Multicellular organisms, depending on their complexity, may be organized from cells to tissues, organs, and organ systems.
