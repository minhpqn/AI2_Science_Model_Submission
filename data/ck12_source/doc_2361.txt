Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication .
If research results can be replicated, it means they are more likely to be correct.
Repeated replication of investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory.
On the other hand, if results cannot be replicated they are likely to be incorrect.
Why Replication Is Important in Science:
An Example
The following example shows why replication is important in science.
In 1998, a British researcher published an article in a medical journal reporting that he had found a link between a common childhood vaccine and autism (see Figure below ).
According to the article, children in his study developed autism soon after receiving the vaccine.
Following publication of the article, many parents refused to have their children vaccinated.
Several epidemics occurred as a result, and some children died of the diseases.
Child receiving vaccination
This child is receiving a vaccine.
Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research.
However, it could not be replicated.
No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism.
As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect.
Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud.
They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results.
If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might never have come out.
