Types of carbon compounds in organisms include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
The elements found in each type are listed in the table below.
Elements other than carbon and hydrogen usually occur within organic compounds in smaller groups of elements called functional groups .
When organic compounds react with other compounds, generally just the functional groups are involved.
Therefore, functional groups generally determine the nature and functions of organic compounds.
When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including carbohydrates (sugars), lignans (important in plants), chitins (the main component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods), alcohols, lipids and fats (triglycerides), and carotenoids (plant pigment).
With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur in addition to the nitrogen, it forms amino acids which bind together to form proteins , antibiotics, and rubber products.
With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, carbon forms nucleotides which bond into nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) , which is known as the energy currency of the cell.
The properties of all these organic molecules is related to the composition of the elements that compose the molecule.
Certain carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids are known as macromolecules, as they are very large polymers made of individual monomers.
