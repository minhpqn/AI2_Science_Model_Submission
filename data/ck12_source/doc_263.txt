With the longer period of time for the force to act, the necessary force is reduced to one-tenth of what was needed before.
Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design.
Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase.
The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop.
Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time.
These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives.
Example Problem:
An 0.15 kg baseball is thrown horizontally at 40. m/s and after it is struck by a bat, it is traveling at -40. m/s.
(a) What impulse did the bat deliver to the ball?
(b) If the contact time of the bat and bat was 0.00080 seconds, what was the average force the bat exerted on the ball?
(c) Calculate the average acceleration of the ball during the time it was in contact with the bat.
Solution:  We can calculate the change in momentum and give the answer as impulse because we know that the impulse is equal to the change in momentum.
p=m \Delta v&=(0.15 \ \text{kg})(-40. \ \text{m/s}-40. \ \text{m/s})\\&=(0.15 \ \text{kg})(-80. \ \text{m/s})=-12 \ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
The minus sign indicates that the impulse was in the opposite direction of the original throw.
(b) F=\frac{\Delta mv}{t}=\frac{-12 \ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}}{0.00080 \ \text{s}}=-15000 \ \text{N}
Again, the negative sign indicates the force was in the opposite direction of the original throw.
(c) a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{-15000 \ \text{N}}{0.15 \ \text{kg}}=-100,000 \ \text{m/s}^2
The product of the mass and velocity of an object is called momentum, given by the equation  \rho = mv .
Momentum is a vector quantity that has the same direction as the velocity of the object.
The quantity of force multiplied by the time it is applied is called impulse.
