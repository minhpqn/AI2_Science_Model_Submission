Reptiles at Risk
Many species of reptiles, especially marine reptiles, are at risk of extinction.
Some are threatened by habitat loss.
For example, many beaches where turtles lay their eggs have been taken over and developed by people.
Other marine reptiles have been over-hunted by humans.
Marine turtles and their eggs are still eaten in some countries despite being protected species.
Some reptiles are preyed upon by non-native species introduced by humans.
For example, marine iguanas on the Gal√°pagos Islands are threatened by dogs and cats that people have brought to the islands.
The iguanas are slow and tame and have no adaptations to these new predators.
Reptiles can be found on every continent except Antarctica.
Reptiles may live in terrestrial, freshwater, or marine habitats.
Most reptiles are carnivores, and large reptiles are the top predators in their ecosystems.
