Two of the largest extinctions are described below:
At the end of the Permian Period, about 99.5% of individual organisms went extinct!
Up to 95% of marine species perished, compared to “only” 70% of land species.
Some scientists theorize that the extinction was caused by the formation of Pangaea, or one large continent made out of many smaller ones.
One large continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones, so reducing the shoreline space may have caused much of the marine life to go extinct ( Figure below ).
Map of the supercontinent Pangaea
The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of today’s continents in a single land mass.
This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species.
This may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permian—the most massive extinction ever recorded.
At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct.
Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid.
The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%.
A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an iridium-rich layer in the Earth, dated at 65.5 million years ago.
Iridium is rare in the Earth’s crust but common in comets and asteroids.
Maybe the asteroid that hit the Earth left the iridium behind.
After each mass extinction, new species develop to fill the habitats where old species lived.
This is well documented in the fossil record.
Extinctions, when a species entirely dies out, can happen when the environment changes, and the organisms do not have the traits they need to survive.
Since life began on Earth, there have been at least five major massive extinctions.
