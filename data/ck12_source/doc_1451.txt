Many Hindu people come to the temple to emerge in the water and pray.
They hope the water will cure their diseases.
The top of an aquifer may be high enough in some places to meet the surface of the ground.
This often happens on a slope.
The water flows out of the ground and creates a spring .
A spring may be just a tiny trickle, or it may be a big gush of water.
Water flowing out of the ground at a spring may flow downhill and enter a stream.
If the water from a spring can’t flow downhill, it may spread out to form a pond or lake instead.
In the desert, the only reliable water may be from springs ( Figure below ).
A spring may allow wildlife to inhabit an uninhabitable area.

Sometimes an aquifer is confined.
A confined aquifer is trapped between two impermeable rock layers.
Pressure from the rock layer on top forces the water out where the aquifer reaches the ground surface.
Water that flows up to the surface naturally is an artesian spring .
If people drill a well into a confined aquifer, the water may flow to the surface without assistance.
This is an artesian well ( Figure below ).
