nucleons:
A nucleon is either of the subatomic particles, the proton and the neutron, constituting atomic nuclei.
nuclides:
An atomic nucleus specified by its atomic number and atomic mass.
atomic number:
The number of positive charges or protons in the nucleus of an atom.
mass number:
The mass number (A), also called atomic mass number or nucleon number, is the total number of protons and neutrons (together known as nucleons) in an atomic nucleus.
isotopes:
One of two or more atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers.
atomic weight:
The average mass of an atom of an element, usually expressed relative to the mass of carbon 12, which is assigned 12 atomic mass units.
Define binding energy and its relationship to nuclear force.
Describe nuclear disintegration.
Define three modes of radioactive decay and write balanced nuclear equations for all three.
Small nuclear reactors
The machines in the image are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs).
These are small nuclear reactors used for the generation of power.
Primarily the nuclear energy is used to change water into steam and the steam then runs the machinery.
Several hundred PWRs are used for propulsion in military vessels such as aircraft carriers, submarines, and ice breakers.
