No, although it limits the possibilities.
The next thing to do is to make observations now and apply them to this rock that formed long ago.
James Hutton came up with this idea in the late 1700s.
The present is the key to the past.
He called this the principle of uniformitarianism .
It works like this: we understand a geological process that happens now.
We see the outcome of that process, say a rock.
Then we find evidence that same process happened in the past, like a similar rock.
We can assume that the process operated the same way in the past.
Let’s go back to that outcrop.
What would cause sandstone to have layers that cross each other, a feature called cross-bedding?

Earth History
In this photo of this sand dune in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, Utah ( Figure below ), we see that wind can cause cross-bedding in sand.
Cross-bedding is due to changes in wind direction.
There are also ripples caused by the wind waving over the surface of the dune.

This doesn’t look exactly like the outcrop of Navajo sandstone, but if you could cut a cross-section into the face of the dune it would look very similar.
Since we can observe wind forming sand dunes with these patterns now, we have a good explanation for how the Navajo sandstone formed.
