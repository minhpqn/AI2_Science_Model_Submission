The nitrogen cycle includes assimilation, when plants absorb nitrogen; nitrogen-fixing bacteria that make the nitrogen available to plants in the form of nitrates; decomposers that transform nitrogen in dead organisms into ammonium; nitrifying bacteria that turn ammonium into nitrates; and denitrifying bacteria that turn nitrates into gaseous nitrogen.
Gaseous nitrogen is converted into forms that can be used by plants during the process of nitrogen fixation.
Denitrifying bacteria turn nitrate back into gaseous nitrogen.
