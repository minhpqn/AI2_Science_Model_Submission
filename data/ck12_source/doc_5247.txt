Autism has a wide phenotypic spectrum of disability.
Twin studies have been instrumental in demonstrating an environmental component in autism.
dizygotic twins :
Fraternal or non-identical twins; from two zygotes.
environmental triggers :
Any factor, abiotic or biotic, that influences living organisms.
monozygotic twins :
Identical twins; from one zygote.
polymorphism :
Occurs when two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species; may be a genetic polymorphism, due to differences in the DNA sequence.
twin study :
Studies involving twins.
An organismâ€™s phenotype can be influenced by environmental conditions.
Environmental triggers play a role in the development of disease in individuals genetically predisposed to that disease.
Twin studies help scientists understand the relative importance of environmental and genetic influences on individual traits and behaviors.
