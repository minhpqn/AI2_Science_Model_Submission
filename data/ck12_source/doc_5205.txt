Seed shape was one of the traits Mendel studied in his first set of experiments.
Through his analysis of these peas, analyzing seven characteristics, Mendel was able to develop two Laws of Inheritance.
And he did this essentially through just two types of experiments.
Mendelâ€™s First Experiment
Mendel began his studies by growing plants that were true-breeding for a particular trait.
A true-breeding plant will always produce offspring with that trait when they self-pollinate.
For example, a true-breeding plant with yellow seeds will always have offspring that have yellow seeds.
To obtain these plants, Mendel allowed plants with just one trait, such as purple flowers or white flowers, to self-pollinate for many generations.
He allowed this to continue until he was sure the offspring from those plants always had only just the one trait, in this case, either purple flowers or white flowers.
In his first experiment, Mendel cross-pollinated two true-breeding plants of contrasting traits, such as purple and white flowered plants.
The true-breeding parent plants are referred to as the P generation (parental generation).
The hybrid offspring of the P generation are called the F 1 generation (first filial generation).
The hybrid offspring of the F 1 generation are called the F 2 generation (second filial generation).
Mendel first worked with plants that differed in a single characteristic, such as flower color.
A hybridization is a cross between two individuals that have different traits.
A hybridization in which only one characteristic is examined is called a monohybrid cross .
The offspring of such a cross are called monohybrids.
Mendel noted that hybridizing true-breeding (P generation) plants gave rise to an F 1 generation that showed only one trait of a characteristic.
For example, a true-breeding purple-flowering plant crossed with a true-breeding white-flowering plant always gave rise to purple-flowered hybrid plants.
There were no white-flowered hybrids.
