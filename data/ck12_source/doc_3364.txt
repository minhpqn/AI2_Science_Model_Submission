Another device that uses solenoids is pictured in the Figure below .
Pinball machines contain multiple solenoids that operate bumpers, switches, and other moving parts
This pinball machine uses several solenoids to operate bumpers, switches, and other moving parts.
A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it, giving it north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field.
Using more turns of wire in the coil or more current increases the strength of the solenoid’s magnetic field.
A solenoid converts electromagnetic energy into motion, providing a burst of power that can move a specific part of a device.
At the following URL, explore the solenoid animation.
Try varying the voltage and the direction of the current.
Observe how these changes affect the magnetic field.
Write a paragraph to summarize your observations.
Describe a solenoid and its magnetic field.
Which solenoid pictured below has a stronger magnetic field?
How do you know?
How are solenoids used?
Describe an electromagnet.
Explain why electromagnets are very strong.
This crane is dangling a big round magnet that has picked up metal car parts in a junk yard.
The parts practically leap up to the magnet because it’s so strong.
That’s because it’s an electromagnet.
What Is an Electromagnet?
