But Olympus Mons is a giant, about 27 km (16.8 miles; 88,580 ft) tall.
That's three times taller than Mount Everest!
At its base, Olympus Mons is about the size of the entire state of Arizona, about 624 km (374 miles) across.

Mars also has the largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris ( Figure below ).
This canyon is 4,000 km (2,500 miles) long.
That's as long as Europe is wide!
One-fifth of the circumference of Mars is covered by the canyon.
Valles Marineris is 7 km (4.3 miles) deep.
How about Earth's Grand Canyon?
Earth's most famous canyon is only 446 km (277 miles) long and about 2 km (1.2 miles) deep.
Valles Marineris is thought to be a tectonic crack in the Martian crust.

Is There Water on Mars?
Water on Mars can't be a liquid.
This is because the pressure of the atmosphere is too low.
The planet does have a lot of water; it is in the form of ice.
The south pole of Mars has a very visible ice cap.
