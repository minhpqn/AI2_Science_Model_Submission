How would the first 4 seconds of the velocity-time graph for this runner be different from the Figure above ?
A:
The graph line for this runner during seconds 0â€“4 would be steeper (have a greater slope).
This would show that acceleration is greater during this time period for the other sprinter.
A velocity-time graph shows changes in velocity of a moving object over time.
The slope of a velocity-time graph represents acceleration of the moving object.
At the following URL, read about the shape of velocity-time graphs and what it means.
Then use the velocity-time widget to experiment with different values for velocity and time to see how the shape of the graph changes.
Finally, check your understanding by describing the motion represented by the velocity-time graphs at the bottom of the page.
Be sure to see how your answers compare with the correct answers.
Describe a velocity-time graph.
What does the slope of the graph line represents?
In the Figure above , the sprinter reaches a velocity of 2 m/s in just 1 second.
At a constant rate of acceleration, how long does it take for her to double this velocity?
What is her acceleration during this time period?
Create a velocity-time graph by plotting the data in the Table below .
Relate force to motion.
Identify the SI unit for force.
Explain how to represent forces with vector arrows.
Carson has been riding a scooter for almost as long as he can remember.
