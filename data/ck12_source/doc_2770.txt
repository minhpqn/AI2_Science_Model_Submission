Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration
Some of the most important biochemical reactions are the reactions involved in photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
Together, these two processes provide energy to almost all of Earthâ€™s organisms.
The two processes are closely related, as you can see in the Figure below .
In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is converted to stored chemical energy in glucose.
In cellular respiration, stored energy is released from glucose and stored in smaller amounts that cells can use.

Q:
What are the reactants and products in photosynthesis and cellular respiration?
A:
In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) are the reactants.
They combine using energy from light to produce oxygen (O 2 ) and glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ).
Oxygen and glucose, in turn, are the reactants in cellular respiration.
They combine to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy.
Biochemical reactions are chemical reactions that take place inside living things.
Thousands of biochemical reactions continuously take place inside each cell.
The sum of all these biochemical reactions is called metabolism.
Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general categories: catabolic reactions, which break bonds and release energy, and anabolic reactions, which form bonds and absorb energy.
Enzymes are proteins that greatly increase the rate of biochemical reactions, allowing thousands of reactions to occur simultaneously in living cells.
The chemical reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration together provide energy to virtually all living things on Earth.
