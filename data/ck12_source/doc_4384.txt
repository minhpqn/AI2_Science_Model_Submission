Hylonomus .
The earliest known reptile is given the genus name Hylonomus .
It was about 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) long, lived in swamps, and ate insects and other small invertebrates.
At first, synapsids were more successful than sauropsids.
They became the most common vertebrates on land.
However, during the Permian mass extinction 245 million years ago, most synapsids went extinct.
Their niches were taken over by sauropsids, which had been relatively unimportant until then.
This is called the Triassic takeover .
Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs
By the middle of the Triassic about 225 million years ago, sauropsids had evolved into dinosaurs .
Dinosaurs became increasingly important throughout the rest of the Mesozoic Era, as they radiated to fill most terrestrial niches.
This is why the Mesozoic Era is called the Age of the Dinosaurs.
During the next mass extinction, which occurred at the end of the Mesozoic Era, all of the dinosaurs went extinct.
Many other reptiles survived, however, and they eventually gave rise to modern reptiles.
Evolution of Modern Reptile Orders
Figure below shows a traditional phylogenetic tree of living reptiles.
Based on this tree, some of the earliest reptiles to diverge were ancestors of turtles.
The first turtle-like reptiles are thought to have evolved about 250 million years ago.
Ancestral crocodilians evolved at least 220 million years ago.
Tuataras may have diverged from squamates (snakes and lizards) not long after that.
