Inside a crystal, it's the three-dimensional symmetrical arrangement of atoms.

Electronegativity
Describe trends in electronegativity in the periodic table.
Electronegativity is like the number of friends you have
Is it easy or hard for you to make new friends?
Have you ever noticed how some people attract others to them?
Whether it is their personality, attractiveness, or athletic skills – something pulls people toward them, while others have a smaller group of friends and acquaintances.
Atoms do the same thing.
One atom may pull electrons strongly to it, while a second type of atom has much less “pulling power.”
Valence electrons of both atoms are always involved when those two atoms come together to form a chemical bond.
Chemical bonds are the basis for how elements combine with one another to form compounds.
When these chemical bonds form, atoms of some elements have a greater ability to attract the valence electrons involved in the bond than other elements.
Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom to attract the electrons when the atom is part of a compound.
Electronegativity differs from electron affinity because electron affinity is the actual energy released when an atom gains an electron.
Electronegativity is not measured in energy units, but is rather a relative scale.
All elements are compared to one another, with the most electronegative element, fluorine, being assigned an electronegativity value of 3.98.
Fluorine attracts electrons better than any other element.  The table below shows the electronegativity values for the elements.
Pauling electronegativity values of the periodic table
The electronegativity scale was developed by Nobel Prize winning American chemist Linus Pauling.
