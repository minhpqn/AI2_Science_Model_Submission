Can insects hunt for food?
When you think of an animal hunting for its food, large animals such as lions may come to mind.
But many tiny animals also hunt for their food.
For example, this praying mantis is eating a fly.
To eat the fly, the praying mantis first had to catch the fly, which is a form of hunting.
Predation is another mechanism in which species interact with each other.
Predation is when a predator organism feeds on another living organism or organisms, known as prey .
The predator always lowers the preyâ€™s fitness .
It does this by keeping the prey from surviving, reproducing, or both.
Predator-prey relationships are essential to maintaining the balance of organisms in an ecosystem.
Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and zebra, the bear and fish, and the fox and rabbit.
There are different types of predation, including:
