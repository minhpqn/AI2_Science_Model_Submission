The rock seen on the right is exposed in an outcrop.
How do the features of these rocks differ?
The rock in the quarry is being exposed to the elements for the first time.
It is not weathered.
The rock in the outcrop has been weathering for many thousands of years.
Can you identify the weathering features?
Weathering changes solid rock into pieces.
These pieces are called sediments.
Sediments are described in the chapter Earth's Materials and Crust .
Sediments are different sizes of rock particles.
Boulders are sediments; so is gravel.
At the other end, silt and clay are also sediments.
Weathering may also cause the minerals at the Earth’s surface to change form.
The new minerals that form are stable at the Earth’s surface.
There are two types of weathering, mechanical and chemical.
These are discussed in the next two concepts.
Weathering Takes Time
No one can watch for millions of years as mountains are built.
And no one can watch as those same mountains gradually are worn away.
But imagine a new sidewalk or road.
