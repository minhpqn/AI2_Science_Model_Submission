Old and beaten up car
How does a car go from new and shiny to old and beaten up?
Want to buy a car – cheap?
Notice there is no specification such as “in good condition” or “needs a little work.” The car above is pretty beat up.
The body is damaged, the windows are broken, and the interior is probably torn up.
But this is still a car.
It has all the components of a car, even though you would not want to buy it in the present condition.
But change that condition and you have a (possibly) useable car.
As an ice cube melts, its shape changes as it acquires the ability to flow.
However, its composition does not change.
Melting is an example of a physical change .
