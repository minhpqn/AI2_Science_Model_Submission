The compound formed from sodium and chloride ions is named sodium chloride.
It is commonly called table salt.

Why Ionic Bonds Form
Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals.
That’s because metals “want” to give up electrons, and nonmetals “want” to gain electrons.
Find sodium (Na) in the Figure below .
Sodium is an alkali metal in group 1.
Like all group 1 elements, it has just one valence electron.
If sodium loses that one electron, it will have a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Now find fluorine (F) in the periodic table Figure below .
Fluorine is a halogen in group 17.
Like all group 17 elements, fluorine has seven valence electrons.
If fluorine gains one electron, it will also have a full outer energy level and the most stable arrangement of electrons.

Q:
Predict what other elements might form ionic bonds.
A:
Metals on the left and in the center of the periodic table form ionic bonds with nonmetals on the right of the periodic table.
For example, alkali metals in group 1 form ionic bonds with halogen nonmetals in group 17.
