This molecular diversity added evidence that DNA could be the genetic material.
The following Table below is a representation of Erwin Chargaff's 1952 data.
This table lists the base composition of DNA from various organisms.
Data from this table supports both of Chargaff's rules.

adenine :
A purine base found in DNA paired with thymine and in RNA paired with uracil.
base pair :
Two nitrogenous bases on opposite complementary DNA strands; connected by hydrogen bonds; may also occur in certain types of RNAs.
Chargaff's rules :
State that DNA from any cell of all organisms should have a 1:1 ratio of pyrimidine and purine bases; specifically, the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine is equal to thymine.
cytosine :
A pyrimidine base found in DNA and RNA paired with guanine.
guanine :
A purine base found in DNA and RNA paired with cytosine.
nucleotide :
Monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar, and a phosphate group.
purine :
Nitrogenous bases consisting of two ring structures; adenine and guanine.
pyrimidine :
