As another example, assume that you want to calculate the volume of the block of wood shown below.
The volume of the block is represented by the formula:
Volume = length × width × height
Therefore, you would do the following calculation:
Volume = 1.2 cm × 1.0 cm × 1 cm = 1.2 cm 3
Q:
Does this answer have the correct number of significant figures?
A:
No, it has too many significant figures.
The correct answer is 1 cm 3 .
That’s because the height of the block has just one significant figure.
Therefore, the answer can have only one significant figure.
Rules for Rounding
To get the correct answer in the volume calculation above, rounding was necessary.
Rounding is done when one or more ending digits are dropped to get the correct number of significant figures.
In this example, the answer was rounded down to a lower number (from 1.2 to 1).
Sometimes the answer is rounded up to a higher number.
How do you know which way to round?
Follow these simple rules:
If the digit to be rounded (dropped) is less than 5, then round down.
