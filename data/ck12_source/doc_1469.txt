The most important are oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Oxygen is needed by living things in the oceans.
Much of the carbon dioxide sinks to the bottom of the seas.
Carbon dioxide is a major cause of global warming.
By absorbing carbon dioxide, the oceans help control global warming.
At least as long as the carbon dioxide stays in the seas.
Oceans and Climate
Coastal areas have a milder climate than inland areas.
They are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.
That’s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans.
The temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable.
Why?
There are two major reasons:
Water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land.
As a result, oceans never get as hot or as cold as land.
Water flows through all the world’s oceans.
Warm water from the Equator mixes with cold water from the poles.
The mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate.
Even inland temperatures are milder because of oceans.
Without oceans, there would be much bigger temperature swings all over Earth.
