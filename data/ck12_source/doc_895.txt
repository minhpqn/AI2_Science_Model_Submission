Reusing includes using the same item again for the same function and also using an item again for a new function.
Reuse can have both economic and environmental benefits.
New packaging regulations are helping society to move towards these goals.
Some ways of reusing resources include:
Use reusable bags when shopping.
Use gray water.
Water that has been used for laundry, for example, can be used to water the garden or flush toilets.
At the town level, purified sewage water can be used for fountains, watering public parks or golf courses, fire fighting, and irrigating crops.
Rain can be caught in rain barrels and used to water your garden.
What are some other ways to reuse resources?
Now we move on to recycle.
Sometimes it may be difficult to understand the differences between reusing and recycling.
Recycling involves processing used materials in order to make them suitable for other uses.
That usually means taking a used item, breaking it down, and reusing the pieces.
Even though recycling requires extra energy, it does often make use of items which are broken, worn out, or cannot be reused.
The things that are commonly recycled include:
Iron and steel.
Aluminum ( Figure below ).
Textiles, such as clothing.
Recycling aluminum cans help saves a large amount of energy
