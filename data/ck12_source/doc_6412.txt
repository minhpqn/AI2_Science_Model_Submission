Who invented the pH meter?
The pH meter was invented because Florida orange growers needed a way to test the acidity of their fruit.
The first meter was invented by Arnold Beckman, who went on to form Beckman Instruments.
Beckmanâ€™s business was very successful and he used much of his fortune to fund science education and research.
The Beckman family donated $40 million to build the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois, shown above.
Calculating K_a and K_b
The numerical value of  K_a or  K_b can be determined from an experiment.
A solution of known concentration is prepared and its pH is measured with an instrument called a pH meter .
A pH meter can be used for rapid, accurate determinations of pH
A pH meter is a laboratory device that provides quick, accurate measurements of the pH of solutions.
Sample Problem:
Calculation of an Acid Ionization Constant
A 0.500 M solution of formic acid is prepared and its pH is measured to be 2.04.
Determine the  K_a for formic acid.
Step 1:
List the known values and plan the problem.
initial [HCOOH] = 0.500 M
pH = 2.04
K_a= \ ?
First, the pH is used to calculate the [H + ] at equilibrium.
