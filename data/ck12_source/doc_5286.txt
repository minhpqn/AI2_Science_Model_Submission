Is it possible for both alleles to be dominant, or neither to be completely dominant?
The answer to both of these questions is yes.
Codominance is when two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygous individual; that is, they both affect the phenotype in separate and distinguishable ways ( Figure below ).
The A, B alleles of the ABO blood group system are a classic example, and these have been discussed in the Non-Mendelian Inheritance concept.
The A and B alleles are codominant with each other.
When a person has both an A and a B allele, the person has type AB blood.
When two persons with AB blood type have children, the children can be type A, type B, or type AB.
There is a 1A:2AB:1B phenotype ratio instead of the 3:1 phenotype ratio found when one allele is dominant and the other is recessive.

I A i Type A
I A I B Type AB
I B I B Type B
I B i Type B
iI A Type A
iI B Type B
ii Type O
Codominant Inheritance.
The A and B alleles are codominant.
