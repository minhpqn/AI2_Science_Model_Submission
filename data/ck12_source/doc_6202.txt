Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei that contain DNA, and membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food, the carbohydrate glucose.
Plants have chloroplasts, the organelle of photosynthesis, and are known as producers and autotrophs.
Other organisms are heterotrophic consumers, meaning they must obtain their nutrients from another organism, as these organisms lack chloroplasts.
Lastly, plants must be multicellular, composed of more than one cell.
There are no single-celled plants.
Recall that some protists, such as algae, are eukaryotic and photosynthetic but are not considered plants.
Unlike plants, algae is mostly unicellular.
Mosses and trees are all part of the plant kingdom
There is great diversity in the plant kingdom, from tiny mosses to huge trees.
Plants are multicellular and eukaryotic, meaning their cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
Plants perform photosynthesis, the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air to make their own food.
