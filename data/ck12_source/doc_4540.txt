Describe the left ventricle.
What is the role of the pulmonary valve?
What does the heart have a natural pacemaker?
What are the main components of the circulatory system?
Describe how blood flows through the heart.
What controls heartbeat?
List and describe the three major types of blood vessels.
Describe the roles of the aorta, superior vena cava, and inferior vena cava.
Describe the role of the blood vessels in maintaining homeostasis.
How does blood travel around the body?
Through blood vessels, of course.
This image of veins is from William Harvey's (1578-1657) Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus.
Harvey was the first to describe in detail the systemic circulation and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and body by the heart.
Blood vessels form a network throughout the body to transport blood to all the body cells.
There are three major types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries.
All three are shown in Figure below and described below.
Various blood vessels
Blood vessels include arteries, veins, and capillaries.
Arteries are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.
They have thick walls that can withstand the pressure of blood being pumped by the heart.
