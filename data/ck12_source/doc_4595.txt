In fact, it has three lines of defense.
Only pathogens that are able to get through all three lines of defense can harm the body.
The body’s first line of defense consists of different types of barriers that keep most pathogens out of the body.
Pathogens are disease-causing agents, such as bacteria and viruses.
These and other types of pathogens are described in Figure below .
Regardless of the type of pathogen, however, the first line of defense is always the same.
Various pathogens, including E Coli, death cap mushrooms, Giarda lambia, and Herpes simplex
Types of pathogens that commonly cause human diseases include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa.
Which type of pathogen causes the common cold?
Which type causes athlete’s foot?
Mechanical barriers physically block pathogens from entering the body.
The skin is the most important mechanical barrier.
In fact, it is the single most important defense the body has.
The outer layer of the skin is tough and very difficult for pathogens to penetrate.
Mucous membranes provide a mechanical barrier at body openings.
They also line the respiratory, GI, urinary, and reproductive tracts.
Mucous membranes secrete mucus , a slimy substance that traps pathogens.
The membranes also have hair-like cilia.
The cilia sweep mucus and pathogens toward body openings where they can be removed from the body.
When you sneeze or cough, pathogens are removed from the nose and throat (see Figure below ).
