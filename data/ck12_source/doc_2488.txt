A:
In the graph, the pressure of the gas increases as its temperature increases.
According to Amontons’ law, increasing the temperature of a gas while holding its volume constant increases the pressure of the gas.
When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster.
This increases their collisions with each other and their container, causing greater pressure.
Watch the following simple demonstration, and then answer the questions below.

In this demonstration, when is the pressure of air inside the can greatest?
Why?
How is the volume of air inside the can kept constant after the can is heated?
How can you tell that air pressure inside the can is lower after the can cools?
State Amontons’ law.
Assume you have a sealed jug that contains only air.
If you heat the air in the jug, it will have a higher temperature.
What other property of the air will also change?
A father does a classic experiment for his son, which is pictured in the Figure below .
First, he put a small piece of paper in a glass bottle and lit the paper with a match.
He immediately placed a shelled, hard-boiled egg over the bottle opening.
The paper soon burned out, and after a few seconds, the egg slipped inside the bottle.
Apply Amontons’ law to explain why.
