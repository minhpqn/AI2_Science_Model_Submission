What is a Punnett square?
How is it used?
Draw a Punnett square of an Ss x ss cross.
The S allele codes for long stems in pea plants and the s allele codes for short stems.
If S is dominant to s , what percentage of the offspring would you expect to have each phenotype?
What letter should replace the question marks (?) in this Punnett square?
Explain how you know.
How do the Punnett squares for a monohybrid cross and a dihybrid cross differ?
What are the genotypes of gametes of a AaBb self-pollination?
Mendel carried out a dihybrid cross to examine the inheritance of the characteristics for seed color and seed shape.
The dominant allele for yellow seed color is Y , and the recessive allele for green color is y .
The dominant allele for round seeds is R , and the recessive allele for a wrinkled shape is r .
The two plants that were crossed were F1 dihybrids RrYy .
Identify the ratios of traits that Mendel observed in the F2 generation.
Create a Punnett square to help you answer the question.
Describe complex patterns of inheritance.
