The more energy the wave has, the farther the particles of the medium move.
The distance the particles move is measured by the wave’s amplitude.
What Is Wave Amplitude?
Wave amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave passes through.
The resting position of a particle of the medium is where the particle would be in the absence of a wave.
The Figure below show the amplitudes of two different types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves.
In a transverse wave, particles of the medium move up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave.
Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height between the crest and the resting position.
The crest is the highest point particles of the medium reach.
The higher the crests are, the greater the amplitude of the wave.
In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium move back and forth in the same direction as the wave.
Wave amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is compressed by the wave.
The closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave.
You can simulate waves with different amplitudes in the animation at this URL:

Q:
What do you think determines a wave’s amplitude?
A:
Wave amplitude is determined by the energy of the disturbance that causes the wave.
