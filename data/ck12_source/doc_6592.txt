Milk is one of the basic foods needed for good nutrition, especially for growing children.
It contains vitamins and minerals necessary for healthy development.
Unfortunately, milk and other dairy products also contains lactose, a carbohydrate that can make some people very ill.
Lactose intolerance is a condition in which the lactose in milk cannot be digested well in the small intestine.
The undigested lactose then moves into the large intestine where bacteria attack it, forming large amounts of gas.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, cramps, nausea, and vomiting.
Often, the individual will outgrow this problem.
