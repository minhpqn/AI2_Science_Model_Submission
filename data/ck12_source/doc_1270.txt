At convergent boundaries, old oceanic crust is destroyed.
But at transform plate boundaries, crust is neither created nor destroyed.
Map of the San Andreas Fault
The red line is the San Andreas Fault.
On the left is the Pacific Plate, which is moving northeast.
On the right is the North American Plate, which is moving southwest.
The movement of the plates is relative to each other.
At transform plate boundaries, two plates move in opposite direction.
Transform faults are the site of massive earthquakes.
The San Andreas Fault is the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates.
It is the site of massive earthquakes.
