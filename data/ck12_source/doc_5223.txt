Using Probability in a Heterozygous Cross
We can calculate the probability of any one of the offspring being heterozygous ( Pp ) or homozygous ( PP or pp ) for flower color.
The probability of a plant inheriting the P or p allele from a heterozygous parent is ½.
Multiply the probabilities of inheriting both alleles to find the probability that any one plant will be a pp homozygote.
½ × ½ = ¼ or 0.25
Only 25 %, or one outcome out of four, will result in a plant homozygous for white flower color ( pp ).
The possibility that any one plant will be a PP homozygote is also 1/4.
The heterozygous allele combination can happen twice ( Pp or pP ), so the two probabilities are added together ¼ + ¼ = 2/4, or ½.
The probability that an offspring plant will be Pp heterozygous is ½.
probability :
The likelihood, or chance, that a certain event will occur.
Probability is the likelihood that a certain event will occur.
It is expressed by comparing the number of events that actually occur to the total number of possible events.
Probability can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or ratio.
