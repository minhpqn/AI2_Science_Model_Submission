A:
Energetic particles in solar wind collide with atoms in the atmosphere over the poles, and energy is released in the form of light.
The swirling patterns of light follow lines of magnetic force in the magnetosphere.
Finding the Way
Another benefit of Earth’s magnetic field is its use for navigation.
People use compasses to detect Earth’s magnetic north pole and tell direction.
Many animals have natural “compasses” that work just as well.
For example, the loggerhead turtle in the Figure below senses the direction and strength of Earth’s magnetic field and uses it to navigate along migration routes.
Many migratory bird species can also sense the magnetic field and use it for navigation.
Recent research suggests that they may have structures in their eyes that let them see Earth’s magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Q:
In the past, Earth’s magnetic poles have switched places and reversed Earth’s magnetic field.
How might a magnetic reversal affect loggerhead turtle navigation?
A:
You can find out at this URL:
Earth has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field called the magnetosphere.
The magnetosphere protects Earth’s organisms from solar radiation.
Some organisms—including humans with compasses—use Earth’s magnetic field for navigation.
