You can see some examples in the Table below .
Radioisotopes with longer half-lives are used to date older rocks or other specimens, and those with shorter half-lives are used to date younger ones.
For example, the oldest rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon were dated by measuring the amounts of potassium-40 in the rocks.
Carbon-14 dating, in contrast, is used to date specimens that are much younger than the rocks in the Grand Canyon.

Focus on Carbon-14 Dating
One of the most familiar types of radioactive dating is carbon-14 dating.
Carbon-14 forms naturally in Earthâ€™s atmosphere when cosmic rays strike atoms of nitrogen-14.
Living things take in and use carbon-14, just as they do carbon-12.
The carbon-14 in living things gradually decays to nitrogen-14.
However, as it decays, it is constantly replaced because living things keep taking in carbon-14.
As a result, there is a constant ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in organisms as long as they are alive.
This is illustrated in the top part of the Figure below .
After organisms die, the carbon-14 they already contain continues to decay, but it is no longer replaced (see the bottom part of the Figure below ).
Therefore, the carbon-14 in a dead organism constantly declines at a fixed rate equal to the half-life of carbon-14.
Half of the remaining carbon-14 decays every 5,700 years.
If you measure how much carbon-14 is left in a fossil, you can determine how many half-lives (and how many years) have passed since the organism died.
