A limiting factor limits the growth or development of an organism, population, or process.
Some predator species are known as keystone species.
A keystone species is one that plays an especially important role in its community.
Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the populations of many other species in the community.
For example, some sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities.
The sea stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural predators.
If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth.
This, in turn, would drive out most other species.
In the end, the coral reef community would be destroyed.
Adaptations to Predation
Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve through natural selection.
Predator adaptations help them capture prey.
Prey adaptations help them avoid predators.
A common adaptation in both predator and prey is camouflage .
Several examples are shown in Figure below .
Camouflage in prey helps them hide from predators.
Camouflage in predators helps them sneak up on prey.
Camouflage in crabs and preying mantis
Camouflage in Predator and Prey Species.
Can you see the crab in the photo on the left?
