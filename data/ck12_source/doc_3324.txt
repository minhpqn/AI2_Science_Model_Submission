What is an electric circuit?
Which two parts must all electric circuits contain?
Sketch a simple circuit that includes a battery, switch, and light bulb.
Then make a circuit diagram to represent your circuit, using standard circuit symbols.
Series and Parallel Circuits
Describe a series circuit.
Explain how a parallel circuit differs from a series circuit.
Only a licensed professional electrician like this one is qualified to install or repair the electrical system inside a home.
Itâ€™s a complicated system that consists of a maze of electric circuits.
One Loop or Two?
An electric circuit consists of at least one closed loop through which electric current can flow.
Every circuit has a voltage source such as a battery and a conductor such as metal wire.
A circuit may have other parts as well, such as lights and switches.
In addition, a circuit may consist of one loop or two loops.
A circuit that consists of one loop is called a series circuit .
You can see a simple series circuit below.
If a series circuit is interrupted at any point in its single loop, no current can flow through the circuit and no devices in the circuit will work.
