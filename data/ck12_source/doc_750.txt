A circuit consists of a battery, or a charge pump, which increases the potential energy of the charges, and one or more devices that decrease the potential energy.
As the potential energy is reduced, it is converted into some other form of energy.
In the image above, the device that decreases the charges' potential energy is the light bulb; the excess energy is converted into light energy.
Any device that reduces the potential energy of the charge flowing through it is said to have resistance  because it resists the flow of charge.
Other resistors include motors, which convert energy into kinetic energy, and heaters, which convert it into thermal energy.
The charges in the circuit can neither be created nor destroyed, nor can they pile up in one spot.
The charged particles moving through the circuit move the same everywhere in the circuit.
If one coulomb of charge leaves the charge pump, then one coulomb of charge moves through the light, and one coulomb of charge moves through the switch.
The net change of energy through the circuit is zero.
That is, the increase in potential energy through the charge pump is exactly equal to the potential drop through the light.
If the generator (charge pump) does 120 J of work on each coulomb of charge that it transfers, then the light uses 120 J of energy as the charge passes through the light.
The electric current is measured in coulombs per second.
A flow of one coulomb per second is called one ampere, A, of current.
1.00 \ \text{Ampere}=\frac{1.00 \ \text{coulomb}}{1.00 \ \text{second}}
The energy carried by an electric current depends on the charge transferred and the potential difference across which it moves, E = qV .
The voltage or potential difference is expressed in Joules/coulomb and multiplying this by the charge in coulombs yields energy in Joules.
Electrical power is a measure of the rate at which energy is transferred, and is expressed in watts, or Joules/second.
Power can also be obtained by multiplying the voltage by the current:
Power, P = VI = \left(\frac{\text{Joules}}{\text{coulomb}}\right)\left(\frac{\text{coulomb}}{\text{second}}\right) = \frac{\text{Joules}}{\text{second}} = \text{watts}.
