An abstract model is a theoretical construct that represents something.
Models are developed to allow reasoning within a simplified framework that is similar to the phenomena being investigated.
The simplified model may assume certain things that are known to be incomplete in some details.
Such assumptions can be useful in that they simplify the model, while at the same time, allowing the development of acceptably accurate solutions.
These models play an important role in developing scientific theories.
A simulation is a model that runs over time.
A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave.
It is useful for testing, analysis or training where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by a model.
For the scientist, a model also provides a way for calculations to be expanded to explore what might happen in different situations.
This method often takes the form of models that can be programmed into computers.
The scientist controls the basic assumptions about the variables in the model, and the computer runs the simulation, eventually coming to a complex answer.
Examples of models include:
Weather forecast models
One of the main aims of scientific modeling is to allow researchers to quantify their observations about the world.
In this way, researchers hope to see new things that may have escaped the notice of other researchers.
There are many techniques that model builders use which allow us to discover things about a phenomenon that may not be obvious to everyone.
The National Weather Service Enhanced Radar Images web site (  ) is an excellent example of a simulation.
The site exhibits current weather forecasts across the United States.
These two food chains represent the flow of energy in complex systems in nature.
These conceptual models make the systems easier to understand.
