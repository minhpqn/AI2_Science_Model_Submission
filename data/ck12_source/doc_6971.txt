(b):
Solving the second part of this problem will be a two step process.
We will use the capacitance and the voltage drop to determine how much charge was originally on the capacitor ( Q_o ).
Q_o&=CV\\\Q_o&=500\;\mu\text{F} * 12\;\text{V}\\\Q_o&=.006\;\text{C}\\\
Now we can plug in the time we found in part A to the equation for charge as a function of time.
Q(t)&=Q_oe^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}\\\Q(.12\;\text{s})&=.006\;\text{C}e^{\frac{-.12\;\text{s}}{100\;\Omega * 500\;\mu\text{F}}}\\\Q(.12\;\text{s})&=5.44*10^{-4}\;\text{C}\\\

Design a circuit that would allow you to determine the capacitance of an unknown capacitor.
The power supply (i.e. the voltage source) in the circuit below provides 10\;\mathrm{V} .
The resistor is 200 \Omega and the capacitor has a value of 50 \mu \mathrm{F} .
What is the voltage across the capacitor immediately after the power supply is turned on?
What is the voltage across the capacitor after the circuit has been hooked up for a long time?
Marciel, a bicycling physicist, wishes to harvest some of the energy he puts into turning the pedals of his bike and store this energy in a capacitor.
Then, when he stops at a stop light, the charge from this capacitor can flow out and run his bicycle headlight.
He is able to generate 18\;\mathrm{V} of electric potential, on average, by pedaling (and using magnetic induction).
If Mars wants to provide 0.5 A of current for 60 seconds at a stop light, how big a 18\;\mathrm{V} capacitor should he buy (i.e. how many farads)?
How big a resistor should he pass the current through so the RC time is three minutes?
A simple circuit consisting of a 39 \mu \mathrm{F} and a 10 \text{k} \Omega  resistor.
