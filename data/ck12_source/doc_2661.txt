Why or why not?
Which of the following compounds are polar?
What are polar covalent bonds?
Give an example.
Why are the covalent bonds in an oxygen molecule (O 2 ) nonpolar?
Carbon (C) atoms attract electrons a little more strongly than hydrogen (H) atoms do.
The illustration below shows three covalent compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms.
Are the compounds polar or nonpolar?
Explain.
Describe hydrogen bonds and explain why they form.
Relate hydrogen bonding to melting and boiling points of compounds.
The colorful red and blue model in the opening image represents a water molecule.
The moleculeâ€™s one oxygen atom is colored red, and its two hydrogen atoms are colored blue.
Can you guess why?
The red color represents negative electric charge, and the blue color represents positive electric charge.
The colors show that water is a polar compound.
What Are Polar Compounds?
Polar compounds, such as water, are compounds that have a partial negative charge on one side of each molecule and a partial positive charge on the other side.
All polar compounds contain polar bonds (although not all compounds that contain polar bonds are polar.) In a polar bond, two atoms share electrons unequally.
One atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly, so it has a partial negative charge.
