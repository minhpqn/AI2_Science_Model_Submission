There are two major types of seismic waves.
Body waves travel through the Earth’s interior.
Surface waves travel along the ground surface.
In an earthquake, body waves are responsible for the sharp jolts.
Surface waves are responsible for the rolling motions that do most of the damage in an earthquake.
Primary waves (P-waves) and secondary waves (S-waves) are the two types of body waves ( Figure below ).
Body waves move at different speeds through different materials.
P-waves are faster.
They travel at about 6 to 7 kilometers (about 4 miles) per second.
Primary waves are so named because they are the first waves to reach a seismometer.
P-waves squeeze and release rocks as they travel.
The material returns to its original size and shape after the P-wave goes by.
For this reason, P-waves are not the most damaging earthquake waves.
P-waves travel through solids, liquids, and gases.
S-waves are slower than P-waves.
They are the second waves to reach a seismometer.
S-waves move up and down.
They change the rock’s shape as they travel.
S-waves are about half as fast as P-waves, at about 3.5 km (2 miles) per second.
S-waves can only move through solids.
