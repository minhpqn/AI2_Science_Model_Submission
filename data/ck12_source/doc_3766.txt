These molecules then combined with other simple molecules to form more complex molecules.
Over many years and probably trillions and trillions of chemical reactions, more complex molecules, and more stable molecules, formed.
The First Organic Molecules
All living things consist of organic molecules , centered around the element carbon.
Therefore, it is likely that organic molecules evolved before cells, perhaps as long as 4 billion years ago.
How did these building blocks of life first form?
Scientists think that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earth’s early atmosphere.
The early atmosphere contained gases such as ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide.
Scientists hypothesize that this created a “soup” of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals.
In 1953, scientists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey used their imaginations to test this hypothesis.
They created a simulation experiment to see if organic molecules could arise in this way (see Figure below ).
They used a mixture of gases to represent Earth’s early atmosphere.
Then, they passed sparks through the gases to represent lightning.
Within a week, several simple organic molecules had formed.

Miller and Urey’s Experiment.
Miller and Urey demonstrated that organic molecules could form under simulated conditions of early Earth.
What assumptions were their simulation based upon?
