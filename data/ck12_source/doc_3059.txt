A :
The machine must apply the force over a shorter distance.
That’s because a machine doesn’t change the amount of work and work equals force times distance.
Therefore, if force increases, distance must decrease.
For the same reason, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.
Examples of machines that increase force are steering wheels and pliers (see Figure below ).
Read below to find out how both of these machines work.
In each case, the machine applies more force than the user applies to the machine, but the machine applies the force over a shorter distance.
Examples of force increasing machine
Examples of machines that increase the distance over which force is applied are leaf rakes and hammers (see Figure below ).
Read below to find out how these two machines work.
In each case, the machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, but it reduces the strength of the force.
Examples of distance increasing machines
Changing the Direction of Force
Some machines change the direction of the force applied by the user.
They may or may not also change the strength of the force or the distance over which the force is applied.
Two examples of machines that work this way are the claw ends of hammers and flagpole pulleys.
You can see in the Figure below how each of these machines works.
In both cases, the direction of the force applied by the user is reversed by the machine.
