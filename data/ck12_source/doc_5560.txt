Give examples of heterogeneous mixtures.
Handful of jelly beans
What's the best way to eat a bag of jelly beans?
Many people open the bag and eat all the candy, no matter what flavor each piece is.
Others pick through the collection.
They might say “I don’t like the orange ones.” Or maybe they just care for the lemon ones.
There are different kinds of jelly beans in the mixture and people will eat what they want and get rid of the rest.
A heterogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the composition is not uniform throughout the mixture.
Vegetable soup is a heterogeneous mixture.
Any given spoonful of soup will contain varying amounts of the different vegetables and other components of the soup.
A phase is any part of a sample that has a uniform composition and properties.
By definition, a pure substance or a homogeneous mixture consists of a single phase.
A heterogeneous mixture consists of two or more phases.  When oil and water are combined, they do not mix evenly, but instead form two separate layers.
Each of the layers is called a phase.
Oil and water form a heterogeneous mixture
Oil and water do not mix, instead forming two distinct layers called phases.
The oil phase is less dense than the water phase and so the oil floats on top of the water.
In the vegetable soup example, one phase would be the liquid soup itself.
This phase has vitamins, minerals, and other components dissolved in the water.
This phase would be homogeneous.
