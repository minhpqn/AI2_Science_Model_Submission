An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy.
When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet rotates, causing a shaft to rotate as well.
The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device.

The girl on the left in this photo is riding a stationary bike.
She’s getting exercise, but that’s not the real reason she’s riding the bike.
She’s using her muscle power to generate electricity through a process called electromagnetic induction.
What Is Electromagnetic Induction?
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field.
It occurs whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another.
