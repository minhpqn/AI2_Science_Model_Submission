Just because a resource is renewable, it doesn’t mean we should use it carelessly.
If we aren’t careful, we can pollute resources.
Then they may no longer be fit for use.
Water is one example.
If we pollute a water source, it may not be usable for drinking, bathing, or any other type of use.
We can also overuse resources that should be renewable.
In this case, the resources may not be able to recover.
For example, fish are renewable resources.
That’s because they can reproduce and make more fish.
But water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if their population becomes too low.
Another example is pictured below ( Figure below ).
People hiking in a forest, and a forest destroyed by human acid rain
Forests should be renewable resources.
The forest on the left is healthy and is used for recreation.
The forest on the right was killed by acid rain.
Human use: hiking and bird watching.
Human misuse: destruction by acid rain.
Some resources can’t be renewed.
At least, they can’t be renewed fast enough to keep up with use.
Fossil fuels are an example.
