Frogs are found in many areas of the world, from the tropics to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests.
Consisting of more than 5,000 species (about 88% of amphibian species are frogs), they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates.
Frogs range in size from less than 0.5 inches in species in Brazil and Cuba to the over 1-foot (33 cm) long goliath frog of Cameroon, which can weigh up to 7 pounds.
That is 1-foot from the nose to the back of the body, not including the length of the legs.
Even the largest frogs are significantly smaller than common reptiles.
Characteristics of Frogs
Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed finger-like parts, and the lack of a tail.
They also have a three-chambered heart, as do all tetrapods except birds and mammals.
Most frogs live part of the time in water and part of the time on land.
They move easily on land by jumping or climbing.
To become great jumpers, frogs evolved long hind legs and long ankle bones.
They also have a short backbone with only ten vertebrae.
Frog and toad skin hangs loosely on the body, and skin texture can be smooth, warty, or folded.
Frogs and toads donâ€™t have fur, feathers, or scales on their skin.
Instead, they have a moist and permeable skin layer covered with mucous glands.
Their special skin allows them to breathe through their skin in addition to using their lungs.
They are vulnerable to water loss through the skin in dry conditions, which is why they need to live near water or in moist environments.
The thin layer of mucous keeps the skin moist.
In order to live on land and in water, frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is see-through to protect the eyes underwater, and the two other ones let them see on land.
Frogs also have a tympanum , which acts like a simple ear.
