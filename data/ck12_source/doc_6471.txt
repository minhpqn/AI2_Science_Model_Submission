Gold and silver are often used for jewelry because they are very unreactive
How much for that necklace?
Gold and silver are widely used metals for making jewelry.
One of the reasons these metals are employed for this purpose is that they are very unreactive.
They do not react in contact with most other metals, so they are more likely to stay intact under challenging conditions.

Direct Redox Reactions
When a strip of zinc metal is placed into a blue solution of copper(II) sulfate ( Figure below ), a reaction immediately begins as the zinc strip begins to darken.
If left in the solution for a longer period of time, the zinc will gradually decay due to oxidation to zinc ions.
At the same time, the copper(II) ions from the solution are reduced to copper metal (see Figure below ), which causes the blue copper(II) sulfate solution to become colorless.
Copper sulfate is initially a blue solution
Copper sulfate solution.
The reaction of zinc with copper sulfate is a redox reaction
Reaction of zinc metal in copper sulfate solution.
The process that occurs in this redox reaction is shown below as two separate half-reactions, which can then be combined into the full redox reaction.
& \text{Oxidation}: \quad \quad \ \text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} (aq) + 2e^- \\& \underline{\text{Reduction}: \quad \ \quad \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}(s) \qquad \qquad \qquad \ }\\&\text{Full Reaction}: \quad \text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{Cu}(s)
