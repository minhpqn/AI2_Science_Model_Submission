Over millions of years, the organic material turned into fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels are compounds of carbon and hydrogen, called hydrocarbons ( Figure below ).
An animated view of a hydrocarbon is seen here:
Structure of methane
Hydrocarbons are made of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
This molecule with one carbon and four hydrogen atoms is methane.
Hydrocarbons can be solid, liquid, or gas.
The solid form is coal.
The liquid form is petroleum, or crude oil.
The gaseous form is natural gas.
The solar energy stored in fossil fuels is a rich source of energy.
But because they take so long to form, they are nonrenewable.
Hydrocarbons are molecules made of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms.
Ancient living organisms died and were buried quickly.
Their remains were altered by intense heat and pressure.
This formed fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels include solid coal, liquid petroleum, and liquid natural gas.
