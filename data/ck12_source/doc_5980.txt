Aqueous solutions of lead(II) nitrate and sodium chloride are mixed.
The products of the reaction are an aqueous solution of sodium nitrate and a solid precipitate of lead(II) chloride.
Step 1:
Plan the problem.
Follow the steps for writing and balancing a chemical equation.
Step 2:
Solve.
Write the skeleton equation with the correct formulas.
\text{Pb(NO}_3)_2(aq)+\text{NaCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaNO}_3(aq)+\text{PbCl}_2(s)
Count the number of each atom or polyatomic ion on both sides of the equation.
1 Pb atom
1 Pb atom
2 NO 3 - ions
1 NO 3 - ions
1 Na atom
1 Na atom
1 Cl atom
2 Cl atoms
The nitrate ions and the chlorine atoms are unbalanced.
Start by placing a 2 in front of the NaCl.
