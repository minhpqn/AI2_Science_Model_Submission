There are only about 25 living species of lancelets.
They inhabit the ocean floor where the water is shallow.
Lancelet larvae are free-swimming.
The adults can swim but spend most of their time buried in the sand.
Like tunicates, lancelets are filter feeders.
They take in water through their mouth and expel it through an opening called the atriopore (see Figure below ).
Lancelets reproduce sexually and have separates sexes.
