chiasmata (singular, chiasma ):
The point where two homologous non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material during recombination (crossing-over).
crossing-over :
The exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes; also known as recombination.
homologous recombination :
A type of genetic recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA.
independent assortment :
The independent assortment of chromosomes to haploid cells during meiosis; the process of random segregation and assortment of chromosomes during anaphase I of meiosis resulting in the production of genetically unique gametes.
Law of Independent Assortment :
States that the inheritance of one trait will not affect the inheritance of another trait.
Law of Segregation :
Mendelâ€™s first law of inheritance; states that the two factors (alleles) controlling a characteristic separate during gamete formation.
random fertilization :
Chance fertilization of two gametes from millions of possibilities.
