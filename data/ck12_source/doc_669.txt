Refraction of Mechanical Waves
Define and describe refraction of mechanical waves.
State and use the law of refraction.
A straw looks bent in a glass of water due to refraction
A straw in a glass of water seen from the side often appears broken, even though it is not.
The apparent break is due to the bending of light rays leaving the straw; as the light passes from the water to the glass and from the glass to the air, the light rays are bent.
Nonetheless, your eye traces the light ray backward as if the light has followed a straight path from its origin at the straw.
Since the light appears to have come from a different place, your eye sees the straw as being broken.
Refraction of Mechanical Waves
When any wave strikes a boundary between media, some of the energy is reflected and some is transmitted.
When the wave strikes the media interface at an angle, the transmitted wave will move in a slightly different direction than the incident wave.
This phenomenon is known as refraction .
Refraction of a light ray
Consider the image sketched above.
Suppose that the waves represented here are water waves.
The wave crests are represented by the black lines in the image.
As such, the distance between two consecutive black lines is the wavelength.
Let the red line represent a transition from deep to shallow water.
This transition is called the media interface .
As the waves hit the boundary, the waves slow down.
