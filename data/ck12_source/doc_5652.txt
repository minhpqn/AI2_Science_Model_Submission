The arrow in this photo is pointing to a star that doesn’t look like much compared with some of the other stars in the picture.
It’s certainly much smaller than most other stars.
In fact, it’s only about 20 kilometers in diameter.
Compare that with the 1.4-million-kilometer diameter of our own sun.
Despite its small size, however, this star has greater mass than the sun, making it incredibly dense.
It also has tremendous gravity.
In fact, gravity on its surface is about 2 × 10 11 times the gravity we feel on Earth!
What type of star is it?
It’s called a neutron star.
That’s because it consists solely of neutrons.

What Is a Neutron?
A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom.
The other two particles are the proton and electron.
Atoms of all elements—except for most atoms of hydrogen—have neutrons in their nucleus.
The nucleus is the small, dense region at the center of an atom where protons are also found.
Atoms generally have about the same number of neutrons as protons.
For example, all carbon atoms have six protons and most also have six neutrons.
A model of a carbon atom is shown in the Figure below .
