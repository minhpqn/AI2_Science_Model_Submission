Explain the connection between energy quanta and energy levels.
How does Bohrâ€™s work demonstrate the importance of communication in science?
Describe energy levels.
Relate energy levels to orbitals.
Explain the significance of electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom.
Fireworks are a great way to celebrate happy events.
Do you know what causes the brilliant, colored lights of fireworks?
The lights are bursts of energy given off by atoms in the fireworks.
What do you suppose causes these bursts of light?
The answer has to do with energy levels of atoms.
What Are Energy Levels?
Energy levels (also called electron shells) are fixed distances from the nucleus of an atom where electrons may be found.
Electrons are tiny, negatively charged particles in an atom that move around the positive nucleus at the center.
Energy levels are a little like the steps of a staircase.
You can stand on one step or another but not in between the steps.
The same goes for electrons.
They can occupy one energy level or another but not the space between energy levels.
The model in the Figure below shows the first four energy levels of an atom.
Electrons in energy level I (also called energy level K) have the least amount of energy.
As you go farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher levels have more energy, and their energy increases by a fixed, discrete amount.
