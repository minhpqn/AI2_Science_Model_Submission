The balanced equation is:
2\text{Al}(s)+3\text{Zn(NO}_3)_2(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{Al(NO}_3)_3(aq)+3\text{Zn}(s)
Since silver is below hydrogen, it is not capable of replacing hydrogen in a reaction with an acid.
\text{Ag}(s)+\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NR}
Metals and halogens are ranked according to their ability to displacement other metals or halogens below them in the series.
Take the quiz on the web site below:
What does the activity series tell us?
Can a metal undergo any of the reactions listed below it in the series?
List two metals that cobalt will displace and two that will displace it.
activity series:
A list of elements in decreasing order of their reactivity.
Define double-replacement reaction.
Predict products of double-replacement reactions when given the reactants.
Bartering is like a double-replacement reaction
The practice of barter (trading one thing for another) has been in existence from the beginning of time.
In the illustration above, Items like chickens were bartered for newspapers.
You have something I want, and I have something you want.
So we trade and we each have something new.
Some chemical reactions are like that.
Compounds swap parts and you have new materials.
