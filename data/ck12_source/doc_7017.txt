His insulated cup holds 200 g of water at 20^\circ C .
He has an immersion heater rated at 1000 W (1000 J/s) to heat the water.
How many JOULES of heat are required to heat the water to 100^\circ C ?
How long will it take to do this with a 1000-W heater?
Convert your answer in part b to minutes.
You put a 20g cylinder of aluminum (c=0.2 \ cal/g/^\circ C) in the freezer (T=-10^\circ C) .
You then drop the aluminum cylinder into a cup of water at 20^\circ C .
After some time they come to a common temperature of 12^\circ C .
How much water was in the cup?
Emily is testing her babyâ€™s bath water and finds that it is too cold, so she adds some hot water from a kettle on the stove.
If Emily adds 2.00 kg of water at 80.0^\circ C to 20.0 kg of bath water at 27.0^\circ C , what is the final temperature of the bath water?
You are trying to find the specific heat of a metal.
You heated a metal in an oven to 250^\circ C .
Then you dropped the hot metal immediately into a cup of cold water.
To the right is a graph of the temperature of the water versus time that you took in the lab.
The mass of the metal is 10g and the mass of the water is 100g.
Recall that water has a specific heat of 1 \ cal/g^\circ C .
How much heat is required to melt a 20 g cube of ice if
the ice cube is initially at 0^\circ C
the ice cube is initially at -20^\circ C (be sure to use the specific heat of ice)
