If you do develop an infectious disease, try to avoid infecting others.
Stay home from school until you are well.
Also, take steps to keep your germs to yourself.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze or cough, and wash your hands often to avoid spreading pathogens to other people.
Don't go to work or school if you're vomiting, have diarrhea or are running a fever (and if you are, drink plenty of fluids).
Also, to avoid infectious diseases, don't share personal items; use your own toothbrush, comb, and razor.
And avoid sharing drinking glasses or dining utensils.
Watching the news will allow you to make informed decisions.
If an outbreak of bad beef due to a bacterial infection is in the news, don't buy beef for a while.
If tomatoes are making people sick, don't eat tomatoes until the outbreak is over.
If a place has an unhealthy water supply, boil the water or drink bottled water.
Local news can tell you of restaurants to avoid due to unhealthy conditions.
And so on.
A healthy lifestyle and frequent hand washing can help reduce your risk of infectious diseases.
