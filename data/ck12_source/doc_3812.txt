These structures may or may not have the same function in the descendants.
Figure below shows the hands of several different mammals.
They all have the same basic pattern of bones.
They inherited this pattern from a common ancestor.
However, their forelimbs now have different functions.
Bone structure of various animal forelimbs shows they are homologous structures
The forelimbs of all mammals have the same basic bone structure.
Analogous structures are structures that are similar in unrelated organisms.
The structures are similar because they evolved to do the same job, not because they were inherited from a common ancestor.
For example, the wings of bats and birds, shown in Figure below , look similar on the outside.
They also have the same function.
However, wings evolved independently in the two groups of animals.
This is apparent when you compare the pattern of bones inside the wings.
Wings of bats and birds are analogous structures
Wings of bats and birds serve the same function.
Look closely at the bones inside the wings.
The differences show they developed from different ancestors.
Comparative embryology is the study of the similarities and differences in the embryos of different species.
Similarities in embryos are evidence of common ancestry.
All vertebrate embryos, for example, have gill slits and tails.
