An inertial reference frame can be defined as either of the following:
A reference frame in which Newton's law of inertia is valid.
A reference frame which isn't accelerating.
A reference frame in which all three of Newton's laws are valid.
time dilation:
The relativistic effect of the slowing of a clock with respect to an observer.
In Special Relativity, a clock moving with respect to an observer appears to run more slowly than to an observer moving with the clock.
In General Relativity, time dilation is also caused by gravity; clocks on the earth's surface, for example, run more slowly than clocks at high altitudes, where gravitational forces are weaker.
length contraction:
One of the aspects of Einstein's theory of special relativity is that the length of objects moving at relativistic speeds undergoes a contraction along the dimension of motion.
An observer at rest (relative to the moving object) would observe the moving object to be shorter in length.
mass and energy equivalence:
The physical principle that a measured quantity of energy is equivalent to a measured quantity of mass.
Another way of stating it is that mass and energy are different forms of the same thing.
The equivalence is expressed by Einstein's equation, E = mc^2 , where  E represents energy,  m the equivalent mass, and  c the speed of light.
The Theory of General Relativity
The student will:
state the conditions under which Einstein’s theory of gravity reduces to Newton’s theory of gravity.
state two instances of experimental support for the general theory of relativity.
