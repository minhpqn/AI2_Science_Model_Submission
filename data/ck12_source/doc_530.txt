Mutations are random errors in genes.
Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle.
Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably.
This often leads to the development of a tumor.
A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue.
As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it.
Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen .
Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.
Pathogens that cause cancer include the human papilloma virus (HPV) ( Figure below ) and the hepatitis B virus.
HPV is spread through sexual contact.
It can cause cancer of the reproductive system in females.
The hepatitis B virus is spread through sexual contact or contact with blood containing the virus.
It can cause cancer of the liver.
The human papilloma virus can cause cancer
The mutations that cause cancer may occur when people are exposed to pathogens, such as the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is shown here.
Many different chemical substances cause cancer.
Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ).
In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens.
Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder.
Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer.
