A bear skeleton in the woods would be evidence of the presence of bears.
Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity ( Figure below ).
Of course water cannot be poured out of bottle and flow upward.
The law of gravity is a scientific law , which is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature.
Scientific laws are developed from lots of collected information.
Water going upwards, defying the law of gravity
Water going upward against gravity.
If many experiments are performed, and lots of evidence is collected in support of a general hypothesis, a scientific theory can be developed.
Scientific theories are well established explanations of evidence, usually tested and confirmed by many different people.
Scientific theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory, and no evidence disproving the theory.
Scientific theories produce information that helps us understand our world.
For example, the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientific theory.
Scientists accept this theory as a fundamental principle of basic science.
A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing.
Thus, when scientists find new evidence, they can change their theories.
In addition to the germ theory of disease, other scientific theories are the cell theory and the theory of evolution.
Evidence is a direct, physical observation of something or a process.
