The Cretaceous Period :
During the Cretaceous Period (145–65 million years ago), dinosaurs reached their peak in size and distribution.
Tyrannosaurus Rex , weighed at least 7 tons.
By the end of the Cretaceous, the continents were close to their present locations.
Earth’s overall climate was warm; even the poles lacked ice.
The period ended with the dramatic extinction of the dinosaurs.
What happened to the dinosaurs?
Why did they go extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period?
Some scientists think a comet or asteroid may have collided with Earth, causing skies to darken, photosynthesis to shut down, and climates to change.
A collision was probably at least a contributing factor.
Without the dinosaurs, there were many opportunities for new organisms to exploit in the next era, the Cenozoic.
Which living things do you think took over where the dinosaurs left off?
The Mesozoic Era is the age of dinosaurs.
They evolved from earlier reptiles to fill niches on land, in the water, and in the air.
Mammals also evolved but were small in size.
Flowering plants appeared for the first time.
Dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Mesozoic.
