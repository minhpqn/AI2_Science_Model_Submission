Insulin was the first human protein to be produced in this way.
Insulin helps cells take up glucose from the blood.
People with type 1 diabetes have a mutation in the gene that normally codes for insulin.
Without insulin, their blood glucose rises to harmfully high levels.
At present, the only treatment for type 1 diabetes is the injection of insulin from outside sources.
Until recently, there was no known way to make insulin outside the human body.
The problem was solved by gene cloning.
The human insulin gene was cloned and used to transform bacterial cells, which could then produce large quantities of human insulin.
We know that, thanks to our DNA, each of us is a little bit different.
Some of those differences are obvious, like eye and hair color.
Others are not so obvious, like how our bodies react to medication.
Researchers are beginning to look at how to tailor medical treatments to our genetic profiles, in a relatively new field called pharmacogenomics .
Some of the biggest breakthroughs have been in cancer treatment.
