Thomson Discovers Electrons
John Dalton discovered atoms in 1804.
He thought they were the smallest particles of matter, which could not be broken down into smaller particles.
He envisioned them as solid, hard spheres.
It wasnâ€™t until 1897 that a scientist named Joseph John (J.
J.) Thomson discovered that there are smaller particles within the atom.
Thomson was born in England and studied at Cambridge University, where he later became a professor.
In 1906, he won the Nobel Prize in physics for his research on how gases conduct electricity.
This research also led to his discovery of the electron.

In his research, Thomson passed current through a cathode ray tube, similar to the one seen in the Figure below .
A cathode ray tube is a glass tube from which virtually all of the air has been removed.
It contains a piece of metal called an electrode at each end.
One electrode is negatively charged and known as a cathode.
The other electrode is positively charged and known as an anode.
When high-voltage electric current is applied to the end plates, a cathode ray travels from the cathode to the anode.
What is a cathode ray?
