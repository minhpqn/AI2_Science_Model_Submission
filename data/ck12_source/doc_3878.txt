The Carbon Cycle
Flowing water can slowly dissolve carbon in sedimentary rock.
Most of this carbon ends up in the ocean.
The deep ocean can store carbon for thousands of years or more.
Sedimentary rock and the ocean are major reservoirs of stored carbon.
Carbon is also stored for varying lengths of time in the atmosphere, in living organisms, and as fossil fuel deposits.
These are all parts of the carbon cycle , which is shown in Figure below .

The Carbon Cycle.
Carbon moves from one reservoir to another in the carbon cycle.
What role do organisms play in this cycle?
The carbon cycle is discussed in the following video:
Why is recycling carbon important?
Recall that carbon is the cornerstone of organic compounds, the compounds necessary for life.
But do organisms make their own carbon?
Do they have the genes that encode proteins necessary to make carbon?
No.
In fact, there are no such genes.
Carbon must be recycled from other living organisms, from carbon in the atmosphere, and from carbon in other parts of the biosphere.
