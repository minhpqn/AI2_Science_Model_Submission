Circulation in the Atmosphere
Explain why atmospheric circulation occurs.
Where can you go to experience wind?
Wind is one of the most obviously dynamic features of our dynamic planet.
For a long time Mt.
Washington in New Hampshire was known as the windiest place on Earth.
It no longer is called that, but it's still plenty windy.
A wind speed of 231 miles per hour was recorded on the mountain in April 1934.
In a 200 mph wind, you would not be able to stand up.
Temperatures due to wind chill would be outrageously cold!
Wind is just moving air.
You can't really see it.
Whether itâ€™s a gentle breeze or strong wind, you are most aware of air when it moves ( Figure below ).
You can feel its molecules press against you.
You can see things, like dirt and leaves, moving in the wind.
And you can see object moving, like flags and trees, as a result of the wind.

Why Air Moves
