Prokaryotic Regulation of Gene Expression - Advanced
Define an operon.
Describe how the lac operon regulates transcription.
Describe regulation of the trp operon.
On or off?
When it comes to genes, that is an important question.
And if you're a single-celled organism like a bacterium, conserving energy by not producing unnecessary proteins is very important.
So if a protein is not needed, that bacterium wants to keep those genes off.
Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
In prokaryotes, a combination of activators and repressors determines whether a gene is transcribed.
As you know, prokaryotic organisms are fairly simple organisms with much less DNA.
Prokaryotic genes are arranged in operons , a region of DNA with a promoter, an operator , and one or more genes that encode proteins needed to perform a certain task.
To maintain homeostasis (and survive), the organism must quickly adapt changing environmental conditions.
The regulation of transcription plays a key role in this process.
For a bacteria, many aspects of gene regulation are due to the presence or absence of certain nutrients.
In prokaryotes, repressors bind to regions called operators that are generally located immediately downstream from the promoter.
Activators bind to the upstream portion of the promoter.
The Lac Operon
The lac operon ( Figure below ) is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in E. coli .
The lac operon is regulated by the availability of lactose.
