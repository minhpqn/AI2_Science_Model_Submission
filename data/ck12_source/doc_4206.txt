Adaptations to Air
Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants.
They obtain moisture from the air and make food by photosynthesis.
Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in tropical or temperate rainforests (see Figure below ).
Host trees provide support, allowing epiphyte plants to obtain air and sunlight high above the forest floor.
Being elevated above the ground lets epiphytes get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough sunlight for photosynthesis.
Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores and increase the chance of pollination by wind.
Elkhorn and Staghorn ferns
These Elkhorn and Staghorn ferns are growing on a rainforest tree as epiphytes.
Epiphytes donâ€™t grow in soil, so they may not have roots.
However, they still need water for photosynthesis.
Rainforests are humid, so the plants may be able to absorb the water they need from the air.
However, many epiphytes have evolved modified leaves or other structures for collecting rainwater, fog, or dew.
The leaves of the bromeliad shown in Figure below are rolled into funnel shapes to collect rainwater.
The base of the leaves forms a tank that can hold more than 8 liters (2 gallons) of water.
Some insects and amphibians may spend their whole life cycle in the pool of water in the tank, adding minerals to the water with their wastes.
The tissues at the base of the leaf are absorbent, so they can take in both water and minerals from the tank.
Bromeliad rainwater collecting leaves
The leaves of this bromeliad are specialized to collect, store, and absorb rainwater.
Plants live just about everywhere on Earth, so they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions.
