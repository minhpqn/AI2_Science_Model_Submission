Find the wavelengths generated by your tapping.
You’re sitting on Ocean Beach in San Francisco one fine afternoon and you notice that the waves are crashing on the beach about 6 times every minute.
Calculate the frequency and period of the waves.
You estimate that it takes 1 wave about 4 seconds to travel from a surfer 30 m off shore to the beach.
Calculate the velocity and average wavelengths of the wave.
The Sun tends to have dark, Earth-sized spots on its surface due to kinks in its magnetic field.
The number of visible spots varies over the course of years.
Use the graph of the sunspot cycle below to answer the following questions. (Note that this is real data from our sun, so it doesn’t look like a perfect sine wave.
What you need to do is estimate the best sine wave that fits this data.)
Estimate the period T in years.
When do we expect the next “solar maximum?”
Human beings can hear sound waves in the frequency range 20 Hz – 20 kHz.
Assuming a speed of sound of 343 m/s, answer the following questions.
What is the shortest wavelength the human ear can hear?
What is the longest wavelength the human ear can hear?
The speed of sound in hydrogen gas at room temperature is 1270\;\mathrm{m/s} .
Your flute plays notes of 600, 750, and 800\;\mathrm{Hz} when played in a room filled with normal air.
What notes would the flute play in a room filled with hydrogen gas?
The speed of light c is 300,000 km/sec.
What is the frequency in Hz of a wave of red light (\lambda = 0.7 \times 10^{-6} \ m) ?
