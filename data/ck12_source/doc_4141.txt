Plants supply food to nearly all terrestrial organisms, including humans.
We eat either plants or other organisms that eat plants.
Plants maintain the atmosphere.
They produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis .
Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms.
It also maintains the ozone layer that helps protect Earth’s life from damaging UV radiation.
Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces the greenhouse effect and global warming.
Plants recycle matter in biogeochemical cycles.
For example, through transpiration , plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere.
Plants such as peas host bacteria that fix nitrogen.
This makes nitrogen available to all plants, which pass it on to consumers.
Plants provide many products for human use, such as firewood, timber, fibers, medicines, dyes, pesticides, oils, and rubber.
Plants create habitats for many organisms.
A single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of insects, worms, small mammals, birds, and reptiles (see Figure below ).

We obviously can’t live without plants, but sometimes they cause us problems.
Many plants are weeds.
Weeds are plants that grow where people don’t want them, such as gardens and lawns.
They take up space and use resources, hindering the growth of more desirable plants.
