Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood.
It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins.
Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as "bad" cholesterol.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol.
When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain.
Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis.
If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result.
Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body.
To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed.
Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.
A family history of cardiovascular disease increases a personâ€™s chance of developing heart disease.
Having a poor diet and not getting enough exercise are two major causes of cardiovascular disease.
