What pulls a signal in from vast distances?
Some sort of signal receptor.
This receptor is usually a protein embedded in the cell membrane.
Once the signal binds to its receptor, some sort of outcome is initiated - the signal is transferred to the cell.
This may be from an ion channel opening or some other process.
A signal molecule must bind to its receptor to initiate a response.
Receptors are proteins that bind to their signal molecule either externally (cell-surface receptors) or internally (nuclear receptors) within the cytoplasm or nucleus.
This process is known as signal transduction , and the internal activator is the second messenger .
Once a ligand binds to its receptor, a series of reactions are initiated.
Cell-surface receptors are integral membrane proteinsâ€”they reach right through the phospholipid bilayer, spanning from the outside to the inside of the cell.
These receptor proteins are specific for just one signal molecule.
The signaling molecule acts as a ligand when it binds to a receptor protein.
A ligand is a small molecule that binds to a larger molecule.
Signal molecule binding causes the receptor protein to undergo a conformational change (a change in shape).
At this point the receptor protein can interact with another molecule.
The ligand (the signal molecule) itself does not pass through the plasma membrane.
In eukaryotic cells, most of the intracellular proteins that are activated by a ligand binding to a receptor protein are enzymes.
Receptor proteins are named after the type of enzyme that they interact with inside the cell.
These enzymes include G proteins and protein kinases, likewise there are G-protein-linked receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors.
A kinase is a protein involved in phosphorylation.
