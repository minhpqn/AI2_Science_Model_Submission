Some adaptations are better than others.
Many adaptations protect organisms from the external environment ( Figure below ).
Cacti have thick, water-retaining bodies that help them conserve water

Other adaptations help an organism move or gather food.
Reindeer have sponge-like hooves that help them walk on snowy ground without slipping and falling.
Fish at the bottom of the ocean are tiny and use very little energy because there is very little food.
Organisms have special features that help them avoid being eaten.
Some plants have poisonous or foul-tasting substances in them that keep animals from eating them.
Their brightly colored flowers serve as a warning.
The same is true of some frogs, which can be poisonous ( Figure below )
Brightly colored poison dart frogs have toxins in their skin

Their bright colors warn potential predators not to take a bite!
How Adaptations Develop
Adaptations develop this way.
Think about a population of oak trees.
Imagine that a fungus has arrived from Asia to North America.
Most of the North American oak trees are killed by the fungus.
But a few oak trees have a mutation that allows them to survive the fungus.
