Kudzu had no natural predators, so it was able to out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches ( Figure below ).
The Kudzu is a species that has no natural predators and out-competed existing vines to take over their niches
Kudzu, a Japanese vine introduced intentionally to the southeastern United States, has out-competed the native vegetation.
The habitat is the physical area where a species lives.
Many factors are used to describe a habitat.
The average amount of sunlight received each day, the range of annual temperatures, and average yearly rainfall can all describe a habitat.
These and other abiotic factors will affect the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive there.
The temperature, the amount of rainfall, the type of soil and other abiotic factors all have a significant role in determining the plants that invade an area.
The plants then determine the animals that come to eat the plants, and so on.
A habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem: the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem, whereas the ecosystem includes both the biotic and abiotic factors in the habitat.
Santa Cruz Island has a diverse set of habitats
Santa Cruz Island off the California coast has diverse habitats including a coastline with steep cliffs, coves, gigantic caves, and sandy beaches.
These wetland reeds represent a habitat
The above image shows wetland reeds, another type of habitat.
Habitat destruction means what it sounds likeâ€”an organism's habitat is destroyed.
Habitat destruction can cause a population to decrease.
If bad enough, it can also cause species to go extinct.
Clearing large areas of land for housing developments or businesses can cause habitat destruction.
Poor fire management, pest and weed invasion, and storm damage can also destroy habitats.
National parks, nature reserves, and other protected areas all preserve habitats.
