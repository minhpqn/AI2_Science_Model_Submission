Transition elements on the periodic table
Transition elements are the elements that are found in Groups 3-12 (old groups IIA-IIB) on the periodic table (salmon-colored block in the middle of the table).
The term refers to the fact that the d sublevel , which is in the process of being filled, is in a lower principal energy level than the  s sublevel filled before it.
For example, the electron configuration of scandium, the first transition element, is [Ar]3 d 1 4 s 2 .
Remember that the configuration is reversed from the fill order – the 4 s filled before the 3 d begins.
Because they are all metals, the transition elements are often called the transition metals.
As a group, they display typical metallic properties and are less reactive than the metals in Groups 1 and 2.
Some of the more familiar ones are so unreactive that they can be found in nature in their free, or uncombined state.
These include platinum, gold, and silver.
Because of this unique filling order, the transition elements are often referred to as “ d -block” elements.

Compounds of many transition elements are distinctive for being widely and vividly colored.
As visible light passes through a transition metal compound dissolved in water, the d-orbitals absorb light of various energies.
The visible light of a given energy level which is not absorbed produces a distinctly colored solution.
Colored transition metal compounds
Transition metal compounds dissolved in water exhibit a wide variety of bright colors.

The transition elements are found in groups IIIA-IIB (new groups
These elements are characterized by having unfilled d sublevels.
