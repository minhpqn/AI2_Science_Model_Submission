This technique, which is possible because radioactive materials decay at a known rate, measures how much of the radioactive materials in each rock layer have broken down ( Figure below ).

This device, called a spectrophotometer, can be used to measure the level of radioactive decay of certain elements in rocks and fossils to determine their age.
Radiometric dating has been used to determine that the oldest known rocks on Earth are between 4 and 5 billion years old.
The oldest fossils are between 3 and 4 billion years old.
Remember that during Darwin's time, people believed the Earth was just about 6,000 years old.
The fossil record proves that Earth is much older than people once thought.
Fossils, or preserved parts of organisms from the distant past, have shown that species change over time.
Radiometric dating can be used to determine the age of fossils by measuring the how much of the radioactive materials in each rock layer have broken down.
