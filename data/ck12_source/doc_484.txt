Distinguish rod cells from cone cells.
Explain the steps involved in vision.
How do you see the board?
As you are sitting in the classroom, you may at first be focused on a paper directly in front of you.
Then you may look to the front of the room to see a math problem worked out on the board.
How can your eyes focus directly in front of you and then, a second later, at a distance?
Your eyes are rather amazing!
How the Eye Works
The job of the eye is to focus light.
The parts of the eye ( Figure below ) help it to carry out its job.
Follow the path of light through the eye as you read about it below.
The human eye is a complex structure that focuses and sense light
The human eye is a complex structure that senses light; the light passes through the cornea, pupil, and lens, and is focused on the retina.
The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye, and the hyaloid canal is a small transparent canal running through the vitreous humor from the optical disc to the lens.
Vision involves sensing and focusing light from people and objects.
The steps involved are as follows:
First, light passes through the cornea of the eye.
The cornea is a clear, protective covering on the outside of the eye.
Next, light passes through the pupil.
The pupil is a black opening in the eye that lets light enter the eye.
