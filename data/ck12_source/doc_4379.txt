Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization.
Males have one or two penises that pass sperm from their cloaca to the cloaca of a female.
Fertilization occurs within the cloaca, and fertilized eggs leave the female’s body through the opening in the cloaca.
In a minority of species, the eggs are retained inside the female’s body until they hatch.
Then the offspring leave the mother’s body through the cloaca opening.
