TPA :
A phorbol ester and a potent tumor promoter known to activate the signal transduction enzyme protein kinase C.
transcription factor :
A protein involved in regulating gene expression; usually bound to a cis-regulatory element on the DNA; also known as a regulatory protein or a trans-acting factor.
zinc finger :
A major structural motif of proteins capable of binding DNA; characterized by the coordination of zinc ions that stabilize the protein structure.
Transcription factors are proteins that bind to regulatory elements on the DNA.
The TATA binding protein is one of the more common transcription factors, binding to the TATA box.
DNA-protein interactions include conserved motifs, including the helix-loop-helix domain.
Sp1 and AP-1 are two of the original transcription factors identified.
