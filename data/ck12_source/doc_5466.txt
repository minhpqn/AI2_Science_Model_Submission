The Polymerase Chain Reaction - Advanced
What is PCR?
Describe the processes involved in PCR.
How do you make a scientific process easier?
Use a machine.
The polymerase chain reaction has revolutionized biological and biomedical research and applications.
Luckily many machines have been developed that allow this process to be performed rapidly and with precision.
The Polymerase Chain Reaction
The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to amplify specific regions of a DNA strand millions of times.
A region may be a number of loci, a single gene, a part of a gene, or a non-coding sequence.
This technique produces a useful quantity of DNA for analysis, be it medical, forensic or some other form of analysis.
Amplification of DNA from as little as a single cell is possible.
Whole genome amplification is also possible.
