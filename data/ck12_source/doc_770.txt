Each individual electron in this circuit passes through only one of the light bulbs.
After the current passes through the switch, it divides into three pieces and each piece passes through one of the bulbs.
The three pieces of current rejoin after the light bulbs and continue in the circuit to the potential source.
Three light bulbs in parallel
In the design of this parallel circuit, each resistor (light bulb) is connected across the battery as if the other two resistors were not present.
Remember that the current going through each resistor goes through only the one resistor.
Therefore, the voltage drop across each resistor must be equal to the total voltage drop though the circuit.
V_T = V_1 = V_2 = V_3
The total current passing through the circuit will be the sum of the individual currents passing through each resistor.
I_T = I_1 + I_2 + I_3
If we return to the analogy of a river, a parallel circuit is the same as the river breaking into three streams, which later rejoin to one river again.
The amount of water flowing in the river is equal to the sum of the amounts of water flowing in the individual streams.
Ohm's Law applies to resistors in parallel, just as it did to resistors in a series.
The current flowing through each resistor is equal to the total voltage drop divided by the resistance in that resistor.
I_1=\frac{V_T}{R_1} \quad \text{and} \quad I_2=\frac{V_T}{R_2} \quad \text{and} \quad I_3=\frac{V_T}{R_3}
Since I_T=I_1+I_2+I_3 ,
then I_T=\frac{V_T}{R_1} + \frac{V_T}{R_2} + \frac{V_T}{R_3} ,
and \frac{V_T}{R_T}=\frac{V_T}{R_1} + \frac{V_T}{R_2} + \frac{V_T}{R_3} .
If we divide both sides of the final equation by V_T , we get the relationship between the total resistance of the circuit and the individual parallel resistances in the circuit.
The total resistance is sometimes called the equivalent resistance.
