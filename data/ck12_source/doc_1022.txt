We can test each of these hypotheses.
We can prove either or both of these hypotheses false.
In this case, it's even possible that both are true.
Atmospheric CO 2 has increased over the past five decades because the amount of CO 2 gas released by volcanoes has increased.
The increase in atmospheric CO 2 is due to the increase in the amount of fossil fuels that are being burned.
Usually, testing a hypothesis requires making observations or performing experiments.
In this case, we will look into existing scientific literature to see if either of these hypotheses can be disproved, or if one or both can be supported by the data.
A hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for a small range of phenomena.
A scientific hypothesis must be both testable and falsifiable.
If two or more hypotheses are being tested, they are called multiple working hypotheses.
