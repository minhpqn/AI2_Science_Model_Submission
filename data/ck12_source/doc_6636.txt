Child playing in a sandbox
Playing in a sandbox is fun for young children.
It can also help them learn about the world.
Insight learning is learning from past experiences and reasoning.
It usually involves coming up with new ways to solve problems.
Insight learning generally happens quickly.
An animal has a sudden flash of insight.
Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence.
Human beings use insight learning more than any other species.
They have used their intelligence to solve problems ranging from inventing the wheel to flying rockets into space.
Think about problems you have solved.
Maybe you figured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video game.
If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it, then you were using insight learning.
One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems.
Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent enough to make tools.
In fact, tool-making was believed to set humans apart from all other animals.
In 1960, primate expert Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also make tools.
