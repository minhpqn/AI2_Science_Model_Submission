Now we need to convert the angular speed to units of radians per second.
\omega = \frac{1}{4} \frac{\cancel{rotations} }{second} * \frac{2 \pi}{1} \frac{radians}{\cancel{rotation}} = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{radians}{second}
v = 15 m \times \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac {15}{2} \pi \approx 23.6 \frac{radians}{second}
