A healthy diet includes protein, fats, and carbohydrates.
Why?
Because these compounds are three of the main building blocks that make up your body.
You obtain these building blocks from the food that you eat, and you use these building blocks to make the organic compounds necessary for life.
The main chemical components of living organisms are known as organic compounds .
Organic compounds are molecules built around the element carbon (C).
Living things are made up of very large molecules.
These large molecules are called macromolecules because “macro” means large; they are made by smaller molecules bonding together.
Our body gets these smaller molecules, the "building blocks" or monomers , of organic molecules from the food we eat.
Which organic molecules do you recognize from the list below?
The four main types of macromolecules found in living organisms, shown in Table below , are:
C, H, O, N, S
C, H, O
C, H, O, P
C, H, O, P, N
Enzymes, muscle fibers, antibodies
Sugar, glucose, starch, glycogen, cellulose
Fats, oils, waxes, steroids, phospholipids in membranes
DNA, RNA, ATP
Monomer (small building block molecule)
