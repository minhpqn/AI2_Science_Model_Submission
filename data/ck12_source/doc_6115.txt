Define partial pressure.
State Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
Use this law to calculate pressures of gas mixtures.
Venus has a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide and nitrogen
Is there oxygen available on Venus?
The atmosphere of Venus is markedly different from that of Earth.
The gases in the Venusian atmosphere are 96.5% carbon dioxide and 3% nitrogen.
The atmospheric pressure on Venus is roughly 92 times that of Earth, so the amount of nitrogen on Venus would contribute a pressure well over 2700 mm Hg.
And there is no oxygen present, so we couldn’t breathe there.
Not that we would want to go to Venus – the surface temperature is usually over 460°C.
Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures
Gas pressure results from collisions between gas particles and the inside walls of their container.
If more gas is added to a rigid container, the gas pressure increases.
The identities of the two gases do not matter.
John Dalton, the English chemist who proposed the atomic theory, also studied mixtures of gases.
He found that each gas in a mixture exerts a pressure independently of every other gas in the mixture.
For example, our atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with smaller amounts of several other gases making up the rest.
Since nitrogen makes up 78% of the gas particles in a given sample of air, it exerts 78% of the pressure.
If the overall atmospheric pressure is 1.00 atm, then the pressure of just the nitrogen in the air is 0.78 atm.
The pressure of the oxygen in the air is 0.21 atm.
