This also happens because of heat from the sun.
Transpiration occurs when plants release water vapor through leaf pores called stomata (see Figure below ).
Tiny stomata are found on a plant leaf
Plant leaves have many tiny stomata.
They release water vapor into the air.
Condensation and Precipitation
Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere.
As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses.
Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water.
The water droplets may form clouds.
If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation â€”rain, snow, sleet, hail, or freezing rain.
Most precipitation falls into the ocean.
Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle.
Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers.
These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or longer.
Groundwater and Runoff
Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground.
This water is called runoff .
It may eventually flow into a body of water.
Some precipitation that falls on land may soak into the ground, becoming groundwater .
