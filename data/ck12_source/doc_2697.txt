Examples of Synthesis Reactions
Another example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) to produce sodium chloride (NaCl).
This reaction is represented by the chemical equation:
2Na + Cl 2 → 2NaCl
Sodium is a highly reactive metal, and chlorine is a poisonous gas.
Both elements are pictured in the Figure below .
The compound they synthesize has very different properties.
Sodium chloride is commonly called table salt, which is neither reactive nor poisonous.
In fact, salt is a necessary component of the human diet.

A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more reactants combine to form a single product.
This type of reaction is represented by the general equation:
A + B → AB.
An example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) to produce sodium chloride (NaCl).
