Can you think of other fun examples of energy changing between kinetic and potential energy?
A:
Playground equipment such as swings, slides, and trampolines involve these changes.
Energy conversion is the process in which energy changes from one form or type to another.
Energy is always conserved in energy conversions.
Different forms of energy—such as electrical, chemical, and thermal energy—often change to other forms of energy.
Mechanical energy commonly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy.
You can check your understanding of how energy changes form by doing the quizzes at these URLs:
Define energy conversion.
Relate energy conversion to the law of conservation of energy.
Describe an original example of energy changing from one form to two other forms.
Explain how energy changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy when you jump on a trampoline.
Include a sketch to help explain the energy conversions.
Non-Renewable Energy Resources
Define nonrenewable resource.
Identify nonrenewable energy resources.
State drawbacks of using nonrenewable energy resources.
It may look beautiful, but this oil slick threatens the environment and living things.
Unfortunately, oil spills are common because we rely heavily on oil as an energy resource.
Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource.
