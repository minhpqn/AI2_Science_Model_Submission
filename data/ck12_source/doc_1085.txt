With practice, people can look at a topographic map and see what the landscape is really like.
Of course, it's not the same as being there!
But a topographic map can give you a good feel for an area before you go.
It can also help you to identify features once you are there.
What does this map tell you about the region?
Can you identify features that appear in the photo on the map?
The topography of a region can be shown on a map.
Topographic maps represent geographical features, such as hills and valleys.
Topographic maps use contour lines to show geographical features.
A contour line is a line of equal elevation.
If you walk along a contour line, you will not go uphill or downhill.
Topographic maps are also called contour maps.
The rules of topographic maps are:
Each line connects all points of a specific elevation.
Contour lines never cross.
After all, a single point can only have one elevation.
Every fifth contour line is bolded and labeled.
Adjacent contour lines are separated by a constant difference in elevation (such as 20 feet or 100 feet).
The difference in elevation is the contour interval .
The contour interval is indicated in the map legend.
