People with osteoporosis are at high risk of bone fractures.
Strontium is a silver-colored alkaline Earth metal that is even softer than calcium.
Strontium compounds are quite common and have a variety of usesâ€”from fireworks to cement to toothpaste.
In fireworks, strontium compounds produce deep red explosions.
In toothpaste, like the one pictured in the Figure below , the compound strontium chloride reduces tooth sensitivity.

Elements in group 2 of the periodic table are called alkaline Earth metals.
They are silvery or gray in color.
They are also relatively soft and low in density.
Alkaline Earth metals are very reactive because they readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Reactivity increases from the top to the bottom of the group.
Examples of alkaline Earth metals include calcium, which is needed for strong bones, and strontium, which is used for making cement and other products.
