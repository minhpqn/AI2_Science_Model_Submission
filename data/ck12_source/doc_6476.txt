An electrode is a conductor in a circuit that is used to carry electrons to a nonmetallic part of the circuit.
The nonmetallic part of the circuit is the electrolyte solutions in which the electrodes are placed.
A metal wire connects the two electrodes.
A switch opens or closes the circuit.
A porous membrane is placed between the two half-cells to complete the circuit.
The various electrochemical processes that occur in a voltaic cell occur simultaneously.
It is easiest to describe them in the following steps, using the above zinc-copper cell as an example.
Zinc atoms from the zinc electrode are oxidized to zinc ions.
This happens because zinc is higher than copper on the activity series and so is more easily oxidized.
\text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq)+2e^-
The electrode at which oxidation occurs is called the anode .
The zinc anode gradually diminishes as the cell operates due to the loss of zinc metal.
The zinc ion concentration in the half-cell increases.
Because of the production of electrons at the anode, it is labeled as the negative electrode.
The electrons that are generated at the zinc anode travel through the external wire and register a reading on the voltmeter.
They continue to the copper electrode.
Electrons enter the copper electrode where they combine with the copper(II) ions in the solution, reducing them to copper metal.
\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq)+2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}(s)
The electrode at which reduction occurs is called the cathode .
The cathode gradually increases in mass because of the production of copper metal.
