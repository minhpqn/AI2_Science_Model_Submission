Other tandem repeat elements include minisatellite and microsatellite DNA.
Both of these are also known as which is also known as VNTRs , for variable number of tandem repeats.
Their analysis is useful in genetics and biology research, forensic science, and DNA fingerprinting.
Minisatellite DNA is a section of DNA that consists of a short segments of repeating units 10-60 bp long.
These occur at more than 1,000 locations in the human genome.
Microsatellite DNA has smaller repeating units.
Microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphisms.
STR analysis forms the basis of identification in forensic DNA analysis. 13 STRs are routinely analyzed from throughout the human genome as part of CODIS , the Combined DNA Index System database maintained by the FBI.
This diagram is an example of DNA fingerprinting.
The colored bands represent segments of DNA, separated based on size. 10 individuals are tested for 6 STRs.
Lanes 3 and 10 represent size ladders.
Notice that the pattern of bands is unique for each individual.
DNA sequences that repeat a number of times are known as repetitive sequences or repetitive elements.
For example the sequence CACACACACACACA would be a dinucleotide (2 base) repeat, or the sequence GATCGATCGATCGATCGATC would be a tetranucleotide (4 base) repeat.
The genomic loci and length of certain types of repetitive sequences are highly variable from person to person, which is the basis of DNA fingerprinting and DNA paternity testing technologies.
Longer repetitive elements are also common in the human genome.
Examples of repeat polymorphisms are described in Table below .
Repeat Polymorphisms (bp = base pair)
repeats of one bp
repeats of two bp sequences
