Sample Problem:  Significant Figures in Calculations
Perform the following calculations, rounding the answers to the appropriate number of significant figures.
0.048 \ \text{m} \times 32.97 \ \text{m}
14,570 \ \text{kg} \div 5.81 \ \text{L}
Step 1:  Plan the problem.
Analyze each of the measured values to determine how many significant figures should be in the result.  Perform the calculation and round appropriately.  Apply the correct units to the answer.
When multiplying or dividing, the units are also multiplied or divided.
Step 2:  Calculate
0.048 \ \text{m} \times 32.97 \ \text{m} = 1.6 \ \text{m}^2 Round to two significant figures because 0.048 has two.
14,570 \ \text{kg} \div 5.81 \ \text{L} = 2510 \ \text{kg}/ \text{L} Round to three significant figures because 5.81 has three.
For multiplication and division problems, the answer should be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the least number of significant figures.
