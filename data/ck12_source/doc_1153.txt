They are thought to be very similar to Earth's core.
An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can hold in their hands!
Meteorite containing the mafic minerals olivine and pyroxene, as well as metal flakes similar to the material that separated into the Earth's core and mantle
This meteorite contains the mafic minerals olivine and pyroxene.
It also contains metal flakes, similar to the material that separated into Earth’s core (metal) and mantle (ultramafic rock).
Earth’s overall density is higher than the density of crustal rocks, so the core must be made of something dense, like metal.
Since Earth has a magnetic field, there must be metal within the planet.
Iron and nickel are both magnetic.
Different types of seismic waves behave differently in different materials.
Their behavior can tell scientists about the material they travel through.
Earth must contain metal.
Its density, and the fact that it has a magnetic field, require it.
Meteorites formed early in the solar system.
They indicate something about Earth's interior.
