Lower right box: bb , or white flowers
Only one of the plants out of the four, or 25% of the plants, has white flowers ( bb ).
The other 75% have purple flowers ( BB , Bb ), because the purple factor ( B ) is the dominant factor.
This shows that the color purple is the dominant trait in pea plants.
Now imagine you cross one of the white flowers ( bb ) with a purple flower that has both a dominant and recessive factor ( Bb ).
The only possible gamete in the white flower is recessive ( b ), while the purple flower can have gametes with either dominant ( B ) or recessive ( b ).
Practice using a Punnett square with this cross (see Table below ).
Did you find that 50% of the offspring will be purple, and 50% of the offspring will be white?
A Punnett square is a special tool used to predict the offspring from a cross, or mating between two parents.
In a Punnett square, the possible offspring are represented by the letters in the boxes, with one factor coming from each parent.
