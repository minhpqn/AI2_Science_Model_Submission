This makes biochemical and molecular studies of early embryos possible in the sea urchin, and has led to a number of major discoveries.
Echinoderms in Farming
The hard skeleton of echinoderms is used as a source of lime by farmers in some areas where limestone is unavailable.
Lime is added to the soil to allow plants to take up more nutrients.
About 4,000 tons of the animals are used each year for this purpose.
Echinoderms are an important part of the ocean food chain, keeping seaweed in check as grazers and serving as food sources for animals like otters.
Echinoderms are used as food, medicine, and a source of lime for farmers.
