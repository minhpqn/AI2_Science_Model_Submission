This woman is doing a stretch for the muscles on the back of her legs, the hamstrings.
She also has a muscles on the front of her legs, directly opposite the hamstrings.
These are the quadriceps.
The hamstrings and quadriceps work together as a pair to move your legs back and forth while you run.
Muscles, Bones, and Movement
When skeletal muscles contract, bones move.
But how do muscles make your bones move?
A voluntary muscles usually works across a joint.
It is attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tendons.
A tendon is a tough band of connective tissue that connects a muscle to a bone.
Tendons are similar to ligaments, except that ligaments join bones to each other.
Muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton.
When muscles contract, they get shorter.
By contracting, muscles pull on bones and allow the body to move.
Muscles can only contract.
They cannot actively extend, though they can move or relax back into the non-contracted neutral position.
Therefore, to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must work in opposition.
Each muscle in the pair works against the other to move bones at the joints of the body.
The muscle that contracts to cause a joint to bend is called the flexor .
The muscle that contracts to cause the joint to straighten is called the extensor .
