Scientists are a long way from being able to predict earthquakes.
A good prediction must be detailed and accurate.
Where will the earthquake occur?
When will it occur?
What will be its approximate magnitude?
With a good prediction, authorities could get people to evacuate.
But if the prediction were wrong, a lot of money would be lost as people closed businesses and skipped work.
Plus people would be unlikely to believe the authorities the next time.
Where an earthquake will occur is the easiest feature to predict.
How would you predict this?
Scientists know that earthquakes take place at plate boundaries.
They tend to happen where theyâ€™ve happened before ( Figure below ).

This map shows earthquake probability regions in the United States.
Fault segments behave consistently.
A segment with frequent small earthquakes will likely continue to have frequent small earthquakes.
A fault segment with infrequent huge earthquakes will likely have infrequent huge earthquakes.
The image below shows the probabilities of earthquakes striking along various faults in the San Francisco area ( Figure below ).
The time frame is between 2003 (when the work was done) and 2032.
