Describe the magnetic poles of a bar magnet.
Explain why a magnet can exert force over a distance.
Sketch two bar magnets that are arranged so their magnetic fields attract each other.
Label the magnetic poles, and add arrows to represent lines of force between the two magnets.
Explain what makes a material magnetic.
Define ferromagnetic materials, and describe how they can be magnetized.
Distinguish between temporary and permanent magnets.
This collection of magnets is located in a familiar place: a refrigerator door.
No doubt you’ve handled refrigerator magnets like the ones in this photo.
You probably know first-hand that they stick to metal refrigerators but not to surfaces such as wooden doors and glass windows.
Wood and glass aren’t attracted to a magnet, whereas the steel refrigerator is.
Obviously, only certain materials respond to magnetic force.
What Makes a Material Magnetic?
Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet.
Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter.
When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field.
In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic.
Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum.
These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets.
In other materials, there are regions where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction.
