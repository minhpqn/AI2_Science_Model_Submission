Play is one ways they learn the skills that they will need as adults.
Think about how kittens play.
They pounce on toys and chase each other.
This helps them learn how to be better predators when they are older.
Big cats also play.
The lion cubs pictured below are playing and practicing their hunting skills at the same time ( Figure below ).
The dogs are playing tug-of-war with a toy ( Figure below ).
What do you think they are learning by playing together this way?
Other young animals play in different ways.
For example, young deer play by running and kicking up their hooves.
This helps them learn how to escape from predators.
