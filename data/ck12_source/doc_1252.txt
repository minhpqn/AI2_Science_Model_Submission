Next come two normal stripes and then two reversed stripes, and so on across the ocean floor.
The magnetic stripes end abruptly at the edges of continents.
Sometimes the stripes end at a deep sea trench ( Figure below ).
Diagram of magnetic polarity changes in the seafloor
Scientists found that magnetic polarity in the seafloor was normal at mid-ocean ridges but reversed in symmetrical patterns away from the ridge center.
This normal and reversed pattern continues across the seafloor.
Magnetometers are still towed behind research ships.
They continue to map the magnetism of the seafloor.
Different seafloor magnetic stripes equal different ages.
By using geologic dating techniques, scientists could figure out what these ages are.
They found that the youngest rocks on the seafloor were at the mid-ocean ridges.
The rocks get older with distance from the ridge crest.
Scientists were surprised to find that the oldest seafloor is less than 180 million years old.
This may seem old, but the oldest continental crust is around 4 billion years old.
Scientists discovered another way to tell the approximate age of seafloor rocks.
The rocks at the mid-ocean ridge crest are nearly sediment free.
The crust is also very thin there.
With distance from the ridge crest, the sediments and crust get thicker.
This also supports the idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis, and that the rocks get older with distance away from the ridge ( Figure below ).
This is because the crust is new at the ridge, and so it is thin and has no sediment.
