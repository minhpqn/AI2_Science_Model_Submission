They have caused significant damage to American waterways, locks, and power plants.
Other causes of habitat destruction include poor fire management, overfishing, mining ( Figure below ), pollution, and storm damage.
All of these can cause irreversible changes to a habitat and ecosystem.

Examples of Habitat Destruction
A habitat that is quickly being destroyed is the wetland .
By the 1980s, over 80% of all wetlands in parts of the U.S. were destroyed.
In Europe, many wetland species have gone extinct.
For example, many bogs in Scotland have been lost because of human development.
Another example of species loss due to habitat destruction happened on Madagascar’s central highland plateau.
From 1970 to 2000, slash-and-burn agriculture destroyed about 10% of the country’s total native plants.
The area turned into a wasteland.
Soil from erosion entered the waterways.
Much of the river ecosystems of several large rivers were also destroyed.
Several fish species are almost extinct.
Also, some coral reef formations in the Indian Ocean are completely lost.
There are many causes of habitat destruction, including clearing of land and introduction of invasive species.
Slash-and-burn agriculture can lead to desertification, meaning the fertile top soil is lost.
