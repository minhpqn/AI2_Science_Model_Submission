Some aquatic turtles, such as snapping turtles and soft-shelled turtles, have eyes closer to the top of the head.
These species of turtles can hide from predators in shallow water, where they lie entirely submerged in water except for their eyes and nostrils.
Sea turtles ( Figure below ) have glands near their eyes that produce salty tears, which remove excess salt taken in from the water they drink.

Turtles have exceptional night vision due to the unusually large number of cells that sense light in their eyes.
This allows them to be active at any time of the day.
Turtles also have color vision.
Turtles donâ€™t lay eggs underwater.
Turtles lay slightly soft and leathery eggs, like other reptiles.
The eggs of the largest species are spherical, while the eggs of the rest are longer in shape.
After internal fertilization, a female is ready to lay her eggs, she places a large numbers of eggs in holes dug into mud or sand.
They are then covered and left to grow and develop by themselves.
When the turtles hatch, they squirm their way to the surface and head toward the water.
They need to get to the water as fast as possible before they are fed upon by animals such as seabirds, crabs, and raccoons.
How do Turtles Eat?
Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but in the water is another story.
Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous .
Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food.
Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges.
