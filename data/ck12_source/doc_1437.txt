A good amount of rain would fall.
Not so little that there would be a drought and not so much that there would be a flood.
But the water cycle is not perfect.
Floods are all too common.
A flood occurs when so much water enters a stream or river that it overflows its banks.
Flood waters from a river are pictured below ( Figure below ).

Floods are a natural part of the water cycle, but they can cause a lot of damage.
Farms and homes may be lost, and people may die.
In 1939, millions of people died in a flood in China.
Although freshwater is needed to grow crops and just to live, too much freshwater in the same place at once can be deadly.
Causes of Floods
Floods may occur when deep snow melts quickly in the spring.
More often, floods are due to heavy rainfall.
Floods happen when rain falls more quickly than water can be absorbed into the ground or carried away by rivers or streams.
Extremely heavy rains across the Midwestern U.S. in April 2011 led to flooding of the rivers in the Mississippi River basin in May 2011 ( Figure below and Figure below ).
