Distinguish between thermophiles, mesophiles, and psychrophiles.
Where do you find lots of bacteria?
Practically all surfaces.
Bacteria can live and grow in practically any environment.
It is this ability that has made bacteria the most numerous species on the planet.
Prokaryotes have a wide range of metabolisms, and this determines where they live.
They live in a particular habitat because they are able to “eat” whatever is around them.
For example, there are bacteria and archaea that break down hydrogen sulfide to produce ATP.
Hydrogen sulfide is the gas that gives rotten eggs and sewage their distinctive smell.
It is poisonous to animals, but some prokaryotes depend on it for life.
Organisms that are obligate aerobes need oxygen to live.
That is, they use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor while making ATP (see the “Cellular Respiration” concept).
Humans are obligate aerobes, and so are Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria.
M. tuberculosis causes tuberculosis (TB).
Obligate aerobes are found only in places with molecular oxygen.
An anaerobic organism is any organism that does not need oxygen for growth and even dies in its presence.
Obligate anaerobes will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen.
Clostridium perfringens bacteria, which are commonly found in soil around the world, are obligate anaerobes.
Infection of a wound by C. perfringens bacteria causes the disease gas gangrene.
Obligate anaerobes use molecules other than oxygen as terminal electron acceptors.
