Compare the Richter magnitude scale to the moment magnitude scale.
How do scientists measure earthquakes?
This 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile in 2010 caused over 500 deaths and thousands of injuries.
Earthquakes and the damage they cause can be measured in a few different ways.
One way is to describe the damage.
The other way is to measure the energy of the quake.
The ways seismologists measure an earthquake have changed over the decades.
Initially, they could only measure what people felt and saw: the intensity.
For this, they used the Mercalli scale.
Early in the 20th century, earthquakes were described in terms of what people felt and the damage that was done to buildings.
The Mercalli intensity scale describes earthquake intensity.
There are many problems with the Mercalli scale.
The damage from an earthquake is affected by many things.
The type of ground a building sits on is very important to what happens to that building in a quake.
Different people experience an earthquake differently.
Using this scale, comparisons between earthquakes were difficult to make.
A new scale was needed.
For decades scientists have had equipment that can measure earthquake magnitude.
The earthquake magnitude is the energy released during the quake.
