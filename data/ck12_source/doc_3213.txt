The Ear and Hearing
The ear is a complex organ that senses sound energy so we can hear.
Hearing is the ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound.
All of the structures of the ear that are involved in hearing must work well for a person to have normal hearing.
Damage to any of the structures, through illness or injury, may cause hearing loss.
Total hearing loss is called deafness.
To learn more about hearing loss, watch the animation at this URL:
The most common cause of hearing loss is exposure to loud sounds.
Loud sounds can damage hair cells inside the ears.
Hair cells change sound waves to electrical signals that the brain can interpret as sounds.
Louder sounds, which have greater intensity than softer sounds, can damage hair cells more quickly than softer sounds.
You can see the relationship between sound intensity, exposure time, and hearing loss in the following Figure below .
The intensity of sounds is measured in decibels (dB).
Q:
What is the maximum amount of time you should be exposed to a sound as intense as 100 dB?
What might make a sound this intense?
