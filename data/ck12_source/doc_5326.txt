Nitrogenous bases consisting of one ring structure; thymine and cytosine.
thymine :
A pyrimidine base found in DNA paired with adenine.
Chargaff's rule 1 is that the number of guanine units approximately equals the number of cytosine units and the number of adenine units approximately equals the number of thymine units.
Chargaff's rule 2 is that the composition of DNA varied from one species to another.
The base paring rules state that A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C.
