The 50 g of aluminum is substantially more than its density, so that amount should occupy a relatively large volume.
Density is the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume.
Gases are less dense that either solids or liquids
Both liquid and solid materials can have a variety of densities
For liquids and gases, the temperature will affect the density to some extent.
You can perform a density experiment to identify a mystery object online.

Are gases more or less dense that liquids or solids at room temperature?
How does temperature affect the density of a material?
A certain liquid sample has a volume of 14.7 mL and a mass of 22.8 grams.
Calculate the density.
A material with a density of 2.7 grams/mL occupies 35.6 mL.
How many grams of the material are there?
A certain material has a density of 19.3 g/mL.
What is the material?
density:
The ratio of the mass of an object to its volume. \text{Density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} .
Density is an intensive property, meaning that it does not depend on the amount of material present in the sample.
