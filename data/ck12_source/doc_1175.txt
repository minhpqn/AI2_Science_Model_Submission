Minerals are created by processes that happen in or on the Earth.
For example, when hot lava cools, mineral crystals form.
Minerals also precipitate from water.
Some minerals grow when rocks are exposed to high pressures and temperatures.
Could a mineral be made by a process that was not natural?

Synthetic diamond is a common one.
But that stone is not a mineral.
That's because a mineral must be created by natural processes.
