What is variation?
Why do organisms in different habitats need different adaptation?
How have polar bears adapted to their environment?
How have snowshoe hares adapted to their environment?
How have arctic plants adapted to the environment?
How do adaptations develop?
What does it mean to say that an organism is well adapted to its environment?
What is a mutation?
Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection
Explain the theory of evolution by natural selection.
How did dark deer mice become lighter over time?
A species changes color over time if its environment changes.
Many other types of changes can take place, too.
The darker deer mice evolved into the lighter deer mice in some locations.
What do you think changed about the environment?
Adaptations in a species add up over time.
These adaptations will mean that many genes have changed.
If the environment is stable, the species won't change.
But if the environment is changing, the species will need to adapt.
Many adaptations may be necessary.
