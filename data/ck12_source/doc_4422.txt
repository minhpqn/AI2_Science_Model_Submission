Giving birth to a large infant is also risky.
It may even result in the mother’s death.
Therian mammals are viviparous.
They give birth to an embryo or infant rather than laying eggs.
The female reproductive system of a therian mammal includes a uterus and a vagina.
There are two groups of therian mammals: placental mammals and marsupials.
Placental mammals give birth to a relatively large and mature fetus.
This is possible because they have a placenta to nourish the fetus and protect it from the mother’s immune system.
This allows for a long period of growth and development before birth.
Because the offspring of placental mammals is relatively large and mature at birth, it has a good chance of surviving.
However, carrying and giving birth to a large fetus is risky for the mother.
It also requires her to eat more food.
