The Fluid Mosaic Model depicts the biological nature of the plasma membrane, with a fluid phospholipid bilayer and a mosaic of proteins.
Describe the Fluid Mosaic Model.
The Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton - Advanced
Distinguish cytoplasm from cytosol.
Name and describe three types of protein fibers that make up the cytoskeleton.
Does a cell have, or even need, a "skeleton"?
What do you get if you take some tubing, and make the tubes smaller and smaller and smaller?
You get very small tubes, or microtubes.
Very small tubes, or microtubules, together with microfilaments, form the basis of the "skeleton" inside the cell.
Cytoplasm is one component of cells that is common to all cells.
Cytoplasm is the gel-like material between the cell membrane and the nucleus.
The cytoplasm plays an important role in a cell, serving as a "jelly" in which organelles are suspended and held together by the cell membrane.
Though prokaryotic cells do not have organelles (though they do have ribosomes), they still have cytoplasm.
It is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, including the many metabolic pathways that occur within organelles, such as photosynthesis and aerobic respiration.
The cytosol , which is the watery substance that does not contain organelles, is made up of 80% to 90% water.
The cytosol plays a mechanical role by exerting pressure against the cellâ€™s plasma membrane.
This helps keep the shape of the cell.
Cytosol also acts as the site of biochemical reactions such as anaerobic glycolysis and protein synthesis.
In prokaryotes all chemical reactions take place in the cytosol.
The cytoskeleton is a cellular "scaffolding" or "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm.
