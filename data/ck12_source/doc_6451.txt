The tractor above was once a very useful piece of farm equipment.
But it got old, probably broke down a lot, and you eventually couldnâ€™t get parts for it.
You bought a new, more efficient tractor with all the latest gadgets.
There is not much of a market for old tractors, so it sits parked out of the way, exposed to the weather, and quietly rusting away.
Rust is a combination of several different oxides of iron.
The equations below show the steps involved in one of the many processes of rust formation.
2\text{Fe}(s)+\text{O}_2(g)+4\text{H}^+(aq) & \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \\4\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq)+\text{O}_2(g)+6\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) & \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \cdot \text{H}_2\text{O}(s)+8\text{H}^+(aq)
Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen.
In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust.
Rusting is one of many example of corrosion.
Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes.
Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects.
It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year.
A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion.
Some metals, such as gold and platinum, do not corrode easily because they are very resistant to oxidation by common substances.
Some other metals begin to be oxidized, but are further protected from additional corrosion by a coating formed on the surface.
Aluminum reacts with oxygen to form aluminum oxide, which remains tightly packed on the surface.
The aluminum oxide prevents the interior of the aluminum from corroding.
Not all corrosion is a result of reaction with oxygen.
Copper corrodes by reaction with carbon dioxide to form copper(II) carbonate.
