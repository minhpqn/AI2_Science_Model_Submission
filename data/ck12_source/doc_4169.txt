In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar.
Giving free nectar to any animal that happened to come along was not an efficient use of resources.
Much of the pollen might be carried to flowers of different species and therefore wasted.
As a result, many plants evolved ways to “hide” their nectar from all but very specific pollinators, which would be more likely to visit only flowers of the same species.
For their part, animal pollinators co-evolved traits that allowed them to get to the hidden nectar.
Two examples of this type of co-evolution are shown in Figure below .
Hummingbird and flowering plant symbiotic relationship
The hummingbird has a long narrow bill to reach nectar at the bottom of the tube-shaped flowers.
The bat is active at night, so bright white, night-blooming flowers attract it.
In each case, the flowering plant and its pollinator co-evolved to become better suited for their roles in the symbiotic relationship.
Some of the most recent angiosperms to evolve are grasses.
Humans started domesticating grasses such as wheat about 10,000 years ago.
Why grasses?
They have many large, edible seeds that contain a lot of nutritious stored food.
They are also relatively easy to harvest.
Since then, humans have helped shaped the evolution of grasses, as illustrated by the example in Figure below .
Grasses supply most of the food consumed by people worldwide.
What other grass seeds do you eat?
Stages of the domestication of corn
The plant on the left, called teosinte, is the ancestor of modern, domesticated corn, shown on the right.
