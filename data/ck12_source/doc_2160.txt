Which type of solar system bodies come from the farthest part of the solar system?
What are the major properties of the Sun?
Where is the Sun located?
Why is the Sun important to life on Earth?
Interior of the Sun
Describe the internal layers of the Sun.
What does the Sun look like?
Different instruments pick up different features of the Sun.
None can show us the Sun's interior.
But studies from the SOHO spacecraft and other craft allow us to study the interior.
We know a surprising amount about a body that is so hot and so far away.
Layers of the Sun
The Sun is made almost entirely of the elements hydrogen and helium.
The Sun has no solid material.
Most atoms in the Sun exist as plasma .
Plasma is superheated gas with an electrical charge.
Because the Sun is made of gases, it does not have a defined outer boundary.
Like Earth, the Sun has an internal structure.
The inner three layers make up what we would actually call “the Sun.”
Because the Sun is not solid, it does not have a defined outer boundary.
