Define latitude and longitude.
Why are GPS devices so accurate?
Direction on the Earth
Learn how to use a compass.
Describe a polar coordinate system.
How do you indicate which way the wind blows?
When an object is moving, it is not enough to describe its location.
We also need to know direction.
For example, a wind blows a storm over your school.
Where is that storm coming from?
Where is it going?
Direction is also needed to indicate where two points are relative to each other on a map.
To connect two points accurately you need a direction.
This occurs when you need to go from point A to point B.
It also happens if you want to describe where something is going.
If you are walking across a field, for example, you might say you're going north 20° east.
The most common way to find direction is by using a compass .
A compass is a device with a floating needle ( Figure below ).
The needle is a small magnet that aligns itself with the Earth’s magnetic field.
The compass needle always points to magnetic north.
