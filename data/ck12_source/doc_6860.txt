You can tell the difference between an arachnid and an insect because insects have three pairs of legs (six total).
Arachnids also have two additional pairs of appendages.
The first pair, the chelicerae , serve in feeding and defense.
The next pair, the pedipalps , help the organisms feed, move, and reproduce.
Arachnids do not have antennae or wings.
The arachnid body is organized into the cephalothorax , a fusion of the head and thorax, and the abdomen.
To adapt to living on land, arachnids have internal breathing systems, like a trachea or a book lung.
Arachnids are mostly carnivorous, feeding on the pre-digested bodies of insects and other small animals.
Several groups are venomous.
They release the venom from specialized glands to kill prey or enemies.
Several mites are parasitic, and some of those are carriers of disease.
Arachnids usually lay eggs, which hatch into immature arachnids that are similar to adults.
Scorpions, however, give birth to live young.
The arachnids are divided into eleven subgroups.
Below are the four most familiar subgroups, with a description of each ( Table below ).
Approximate Number of Species
Found all over the world, ranging from tropics to the Arctic, some in extreme environments.
All produce silk , which is used for trapping insects in webs, aiding in climbing, producing egg sacs, and wrapping prey.
Nearly all spiders inject venom to protect themselves or to kill prey.
Only about 200 species have bites that can be harmful to humans.
