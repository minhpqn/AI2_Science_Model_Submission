How much time passes until the ball travels 35\;\mathrm{m} horizontally?
What is the height of the ball after 0.5 seconds? (Assume that, when thrown, the ball is 2 \;\mathrm{m} above the ground.)
Pablo Sandoval throws a baseball with a horizontal component of velocity of 25 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
After 2 seconds, the ball is 40 \;\mathrm{m} above the release point.
Calculate the horizontal distance it has traveled by this time, its initial vertical component of velocity, and its initial angle of projection.
Also, is the ball on the way up or the way down at this moment in time?
Barry Bonds hits a 125\;\mathrm{m}(450') home run that lands in the stands at an altitude 30 \;\mathrm{m} above its starting altitude.
Assuming that the ball left the bat at an angle of 45^\circ from the horizontal, calculate how long the ball was in the air.
A golfer can drive a ball with an initial speed of 40.0 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
If the tee and the green are separated by 100\;\mathrm{m} , but are on the same level, at what angle should the ball be driven? ( Hint: you should use 2\cos{(x)}\sin{(x)} = \sin{(2x)}  at some point.)
How long will it take a bullet fired from a cliff at an initial velocity of 700 \;\mathrm{m/s} , at an angle 30^\circ below the horizontal, to reach the ground 200 \;\mathrm{m} below?
A diver in Hawaii is jumping off a cliff 45 \;\mathrm{m} high, but she notices that there is an outcropping of rocks 7 \;\mathrm{m} out at the base.
So, she must clear a horizontal distance of 7 \;\mathrm{m} during the dive in order to survive.
Assuming the diver jumps horizontally, what is his/her minimum push-off speed?
If Monte Ellis can jump 1.0 \;\mathrm{m} high on Earth, how high can he jump on the moon assuming same initial velocity that he had on Earth (where gravity is 1/6 that of Earthâ€™s gravity)?
James Bond is trying to jump from a helicopter into a speeding Corvette to capture the bad guy.
The car is going 30.0 \;\mathrm{m/s} and the helicopter is flying completely horizontally at 100 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
The helicopter is 120\;\mathrm{m} above the car and 440 \;\mathrm{m} behind the car.
How long must James Bond wait to jump in order to safely make it into the car?
A field goal kicker lines up to kick a 44 yard (40 \;\mathrm{m}) field goal.
