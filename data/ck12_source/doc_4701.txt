For example, a person comes to a new country and observes only white sheep.
This person might form the hypothesis: “All sheep in this country are white.” This statement can be called a hypothesis, because it is falsifiable - it can be tested and proved wrong; anyone could falsify the hypothesis by observing a single black sheep, shown in Figure below .
If the experimental uncertainties remain small (could the person reliably distinguish the observed black sheep from a goat or a small horse), and if the experimenter has correctly interpreted the hypothesis, finding a black sheep falsifies the "only white sheep" hypothesis.
However, you cannot call a failure to find non-white sheep as proof that no non-white sheep exist.
The statement “there are only white sheep in this country” is a hypothesis because it is open to being falsified.
However, failure to see a black sheep does not necessarily falsify the hypothesis.
A better scientific hypothesis may be that "only white sheep can survive in this country because of the existing ecosystems."
evidence :

falsifiable :
Can be proved false.
hypothesis (plural, hypotheses ):
A suggested explanation based on evidence that can be tested by observation or experimentation.
