What are these?
This picture might look like a bunch of ping-pong balls, but actually it's a picture of turtle eggs.
Notice the soft, leathery shell that is typical of reptile eggs.
Turtles are reptiles in the order Testudines.
If you have seen turtles before, what is the most noticeable thing about them?
Their shells.
Most turtle bodies are covered by a special shell developed from their ribs.
Their shells can be bony or cartilaginous , made from a more flexible supportive tissue.
About 300 species are alive today, and some are highly endangered.
Like other reptiles, turtles cannot regulate their body temperature, except with behavioral means, such as burrowing underground.
The major difference between turtles and tortoises is that the land dwelling ones are called tortoises and water dwelling are called turtles.
Turtles are broken down into two groups, based on how they bring their neck back into their shell:
Cryptodira, which can draw their neck inside and under their spine.
Pleurodira, which fold their necks to one side.
Characteristics of Turtles
Although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, they can also spend much of their lives on dry land and breathe air.
Turtles cannot breathe in water, but can hold their breath for long periods of time.
Turtles must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs.
The position of a turtle's eyes can give a clue to their natural habitat.
Most turtles that spend most of their lives on land have their eyes looking down at objects in front of them.
