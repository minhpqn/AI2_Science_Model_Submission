How many chromosomes are in a human gamete?
Explain the importance of meiosis.
Distinguish between haploid and diploid.
List the stages of meiosis.
Summarize the steps of meiosis.
Define crossing-over and explain its significance.
Do you have ALL your parents' chromosomes?
No, you only received half of your mother's chromosomes and half of your father's chromosomes.
If you inherited them all, you would have twice the number of chromosomes that you're supposed to have.
Humans typically have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
If you received all your parents' chromosomes, you would have 46 pairs!
Introduction to Meiosis
Sexual reproduction combines gametes from two parents.
Gametes are reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg.
As gametes are produced, the number of chromosomes must be reduced by half.
Why?
The zygote must contain genetic information from the mother and from the father, so the gametes must contain half of the chromosomes found in normal body cells.
When two gametes come together at fertilization, the normal amount of chromosomes results.
Gametes are produced by a special type of cell division known as meiosis .
Meiosis contains two rounds of cell division without DNA replication in between.
