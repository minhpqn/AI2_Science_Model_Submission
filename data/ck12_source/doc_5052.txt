autotroph :
Organism that produces organic compounds from energy and simple inorganic molecules; also known as a producer.
cellular respiration :
Metabolic process which transfers chemical energy from glucose (a deliverable fuel molecule) to ATP (a usable energy-rich molecule); most efficient in the presence of oxygen (aerobic).
glucose :
The carbohydrate product of photosynthesis; serves as the universal fuel for life;
C 6 H 12 O 6 .
heterotroph :
Organisms which must consume organic molecules; also known as a consumer.
respiration :
Exchange of gases between the body and the outside air.
respiration rate :
The rate of respiration; the rate of gas exchange between the body and the outside air.
Respiration is the exchange of gases between the body and the outside air.
Cellular respiration is the cellular process which transfers chemical energy from glucose to ATP.
Oxygen is essential to have efficient cellular respiration; most organisms need oxygen for a single purpose: to release energy from food for use by cells.
