These processes modify the mRNA in various ways.
Such modifications allow a single gene to be used to make more than one protein.
Splicing removes introns from mRNA (see Figure below ).
Introns are regions that do not code for proteins.
The remaining mRNA consists only of regions that do code for proteins, which are called exons .
You can watch a video showing splicing in more detail at this link:
Ribonucleoproteins are nucleoproteins that contains RNA.
Small nuclear ribonuclearproteins are involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
Editing changes some of the nucleotides in mRNA.
For example, the human protein called APOB, which helps transport lipids in the blood, has two different forms because of editing.
One form is smaller than the other because editing adds a premature stop signal in the mRNA.
Polyadenylation adds a “tail” to the mRNA.
The tail consists of a string of As (adenine bases).
It signals the end of mRNA.
It is also involved in exporting mRNA from the nucleus.
In addition, the tail protects mRNA from enzymes that might break it down.

Splicing removes introns from mRNA.
UTR is an untranslated region of the mRNA.
