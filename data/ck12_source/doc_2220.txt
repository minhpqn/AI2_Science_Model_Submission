Comet Hale-Bopp, also called the Great Comet of 1997.
The comet has two visible tails: a bright, curved dust tail and a fainter, straight tail of ions (charged atoms) pointing directly away from the Sun.
The time between one appearance of a comet and the next is called the comet’s period.
Halley’s comet, with a period of 75 years, will next be seen in 2061.
The first mention of the comet in historical records may go back as much as two millennia.
Where Comets Come From
Short-period comets have periods of about 200 years or less.
These comets come from a region beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper belt (pronounced “KI-per”).
The Kuiper belt also contains asteroids and at least two dwarf planets.
Comets with periods as long as thousands or even millions of years come from a very distant region of the solar system.
This region is called the Oort cloud.
It is about 50,000-100,000 AU from the Sun (50,000–100,000 times the distance from the Sun to Earth).
Comets are icy objects that have very elliptical orbits around the Sun.
Comet tails form as ice vaporizes and glows in the Sun's light.
Short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune, and long-period comets come from the Oort cloud far out away from the Sun.
