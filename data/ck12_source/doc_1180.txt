Mineralogists are scientists who study minerals.
They divide minerals into groups based on chemical composition.
Even though there are over 4,000 minerals, most minerals fit into one of eight mineral groups.
Silicates are the largest mineral group.
About 1,000 silicate minerals are known.
Silicate minerals are also extremely common.
They make up over 90% of Earth's crust!
Silicates contain silicon atoms and oxygen atoms.
One silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms.
These atoms form a tetrahedron ( Figure below ).
The silica tetrahedron is the building block of silicate minerals.
Most silicates contain other elements.
These elements include calcium, iron, and magnesium.

Silicate minerals are divided into six smaller groups.
In each group, the silicate pyramids join together differently.
The pyramids can stand alone.
They can form into connected circles called rings.
Some pyramids link into single and double chains.
