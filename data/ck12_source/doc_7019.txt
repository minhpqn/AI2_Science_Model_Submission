The pressure of a gas is the force the gas exerts on a certain area.
For a gas in a container, the amount of pressure is directly related to the number and intensity of atomic collisions on a container wall.
An ideal gas is a gas for which interactions between molecules are negligible, and for which the gas atoms or molecules themselves store no potential energy.
For an “ideal” gas, the pressure, temperature, and volume are simply related by the ideal gas law.
Atmospheric pressure ( 1 \;\mathrm{atm} = 101,000 Pascals) is the pressure we feel at sea level due to the weight of the atmosphere above us.
As we rise in elevation, there is less of an atmosphere to push down on us and thus less pressure.
How many molecules of gas does it take to equalize the pressure inside a 1 liter box, that originally starts with no gas inside, with the atmospheric pressure at room temperature (300 K)?
To solve this problem, we just plug in the given values into the ideal gas law.
PV&=NkT\\\N&=\frac{PV}{kT}\\\N&=\frac{101000\;\text{Pa} * 1\;\text{L}}{1.38*10^{-23}\;\text{J/K} * 300\;\text{K}}\\\N&=2.44*10^{25}\;\text{molecules}\\\

If the number of molecules is increased, how is the pressure on a particular area of the box affected?
Explain conceptually, in words rather than with equations.
Use the formula P = F / A to argue why it is easier to pop a balloon with a needle than with a finger (pretend you don’t have long fingernails).
Take an empty plastic water bottle and suck all the air out of it with your mouth.
The bottle crumples.
Why, exactly, does it do this?
You will notice that if you buy a large drink in a plastic cup, there will often be a small hole in the top of the cup, in addition to the hole that your straw fits through.
Why is this small hole necessary for drinking?
