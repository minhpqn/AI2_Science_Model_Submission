Visual Communication in Animals.
Many animals use visual cues to communicate.
Aggression is behavior that is intended to cause harm or pain.
It may involve physical violence against other individuals.
For example, two male gorillas may fight and use their canine teeth to inflict deep wounds.
Expressing aggression this way may lead to serious injury and even death.
In many species display behaviors, rather than actual physical attacks, are used to show aggression.
This helps prevent injury and death.
Male gorillas, for example, are more likely to put on a display of aggression than to attack another male.
In fact, gorillas have a whole series of display behaviors that they use to show aggression.
They beat on their chest, dash back and forth, and pound the ground with their hands.
Aggressive behavior often occurs when individuals compete for the same resources.
Animals may compete for territory, water, food, or mates.
There are two basic types of competition: intraspecific and interspecific.
Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the same species.
For example, two male deer may compete for mates by clashing their antlers together.
Interspecific competition occurs between members of different species.
For example, one species of ant may attack and take over the colony of another ant species.
