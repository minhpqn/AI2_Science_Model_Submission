This is the incident angle that corresponds to the largest possible refracted angle, 90^\circ .
No such angle
Describe how light reflects off various types of mirrors.
Students will learn how light reflects off mirrors.
Flat mirrors, concave mirrors and convex mirrors are all covered.
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} +\frac{1}{d_i} \;  ;
The len's maker's equation
Where f is the focal length of the mirror,  d_o  is the distance of the object from the mirror and  d_i  is the distance the image is formed from the mirror.
M = \frac{-d_i}{d_0}
The size of an object’s image is larger (or smaller) than the object itself by its magnification, M .
The level of magnification is proportional to the ratio of d_i and d_o .
An image that is double the size of the object would have magnification M = 2 .
R = 2f
The radius of curvature of a mirror is twice its focal length
Mirrors are made from highly reflective metal that is applied to a curved or flat piece of glass.
Converging mirrors can be used to focus light – headlights, telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and solar cookers all rely on this principle.
Converging mirrors (also known as concave mirrors) are curved towards the incoming light and focus parallel rays at the focal point.
Diverging mirrors (also known as convex mirrors) are curved away from the incoming light and do not focus, but scatter the light instead.
The focal length , f , of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens or mirror to the place where the light is focused.
This is called the focal point or focus .
