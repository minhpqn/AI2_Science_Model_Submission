Responding to the Environment
All living organisms respond to their environment.
If you step on a rock, it will just lie there, but if you step on a turtle, it may move or even snap at you.
Living things know what is going on around them, and respond to changes in the environment.
An adaptation refers to the process of becoming adjusted to an environment.
Adaptations may include structural, physiological, or behavioral traits that improve an organism's likelihood of survival, and thus, reproduction.
