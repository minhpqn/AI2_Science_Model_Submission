The activity series is a listing of elements in descending order of reactivity.
An element that is higher in the activity series is capable of displacing an element that is lower on the series in a single-replacement reaction.
This series also lists elements in order of ease of oxidation.
The elements at the top are the easiest to oxidize, while those at the bottom are the most difficult to oxidize.
The Table below shows the activity series together with each elementâ€™s oxidation half-reaction.

Notice that zinc is listed above copper on the activity series, which means that zinc is more easily oxidized than copper.
That is why copper(II) ions can act as an oxidizing agent when put into contact with zinc metal.
Ions of any metal that is below zinc, such as lead or silver, would oxidize the zinc in a similar reaction.
These types of reactions are called direct redox reactions because the electrons flow directly from the atoms of one metal to the cations of the other metal.
However, no reaction will occur if a strip of copper metal is placed into a solution of zinc ions, because the zinc ions are not able to oxidize the copper.
In other words, such a reaction is nonspontaneous.
The activity series of metal reactivities is given.
Parameters for spontaneous reactions between metals are described.
