Specifically, two noncoding, complementary RNAs, XIST and TSIX, initiate and control the inactivation process.
XIST, or X-inactive specific transcript, was discovered due to its specific expression from inactive female X chromosomes.
XIST has four unique properties:
The XIST gene produces a 17 kilo base (kb) RNA molecule; the RNA is not translated into a protein.
The XIST gene is only expressed in cells containing at least two X chromosomes; it is not normally expressed in XY cells.
Cells with more than two X chromosomes have higher levels of XIST RNA, resulting in the inactivation of the additional X chromosomes.
The result is that only one X chromosome per cell can remain active.
XIST RNA remains in the nucleus where it binds to the chromosome from which it is produced.
XIST RNA recruits additional silencing proteins to bind to the inactive X chromosome.
TSIX, on the other hand, does the opposite of XIST.
Notice that TSIX is XIST backwards.
TSIX is XIST's antisense partner.
The TSIX gene is transcribed in the opposite direction of the XIST gene, and it is transcribed across the entire XIST gene.
TSIX is a 40 kb noncoding RNA transcribed from the X chromosome that does not produce the XIST RNA.
There is an inverse relationship between TSIX and XIST expression.
The X chromosome that expresses XIST does not transcribe TSIX as XIST expression leads to inactivation of that same X chromosome.
On the other X chromosome, TSIX is expressed and XIST is not.
This suggests that TSIX is required to block XIST expression on the active X chromosome, keeping that chromosome from being inactivated.
Inheritance of Sex Chromosomes.
Mothers pass only X chromosomes to their children.
