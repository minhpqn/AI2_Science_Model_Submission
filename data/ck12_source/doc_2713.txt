During an exothermic reaction, energy is constantly given off, often in the form of heat.
All combustion reactions are exothermic reactions.
During combustion, a substance burns as it combines with oxygen, releasing energy in the form of heat and light.

Why do exothermic reactions heat up?
Explain why this reaction is exothermic:
CH 4 + F 2 â†’ CH 3 F + HF.
What is an exothermic reaction?
Why are the products of an exothermic reaction likely to be warmer than the reactants?
Describe an example of an exothermic reaction.
Conservation of Energy in Chemical Reactions
Summarize the role of energy in chemical reactions.
State the law of conservation of energy.
Explain how energy is conserved in chemical reactions.
The blue flame in this photo is burning inside a home furnace.
The fuel is natural gas, and it combines with oxygen when it burns.
This chemical reaction, called a combustion reaction, gives off a lot of energy.
Energy and Chemical Reactions
All chemical reactions involve energy.
