Scientists now know that Archaea share several traits with Eukarya that Bacteria do not share (see Table below ).
How can this be explained?
One hypothesis is that Eukarya arose when an Archaean cell fused with a Bacterial cell.
The two cells became the nucleus and cytoplasm of a new Eukaryan cell.
How well does this hypothesis fit the evidence in Table below ?
