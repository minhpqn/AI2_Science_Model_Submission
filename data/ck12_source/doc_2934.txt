What bacteria were used to create the first recombinant DNA?
In the plasmid pSC101, what does the SC stand for?
What gene did this plasmid carry?
What does DNA ligase do?
How is it used in recombinant DNA technology?
What did Cohen and Boyer do to get a bacteria to take up the recombinant plasmid they had made?
Since not all of the plasmids that Cohen and Boyer created carried both genes they were seeking to transfer, how did they isolate the bacteria that had plasmids with both genes?
What is recombinant DNA technology?
Explain the process of gene cloning.
Describe the process of animal cloning.

Would you like to clone yourself?
Although it's illegal to clone humans in the United States, it is possible to clone many types of animals.
What might be the consequences if we allowed human cloning?
Cloning is the process of creating an exact genetic replica of an organism.
The clone’s DNA is exactly the same as the parent’s DNA.
Bacteria and other single-celled organisms have long been able to clone themselves through asexual reproduction.
