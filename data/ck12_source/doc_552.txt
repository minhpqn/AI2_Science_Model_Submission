They include several lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes.

This diagram shows the parts of the immune system.
The immune system includes several organs and a system of vessels that carry lymph.
Lymph nodes are located along the lymph vessels.
The lymph organs are the red bone marrow , tonsils , spleen , and thymus gland .
They are described below ( Figure below ).
Each lymph organ has a different job in the immune system

Lymph and Lymph Vessels
Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the cardiovascular system, which you can read about in a previous concept.
Lymph vessels are like blood vessels, except they move lymph instead of blood.
Lymph is a yellowish liquid that leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues.
Where there is more inflammation, there is usually more lymph in tissues.
This lymph may contain many pathogens.
The lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels.
It then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels.
Lymph is not pumped through lymph vessels like blood is pumped through blood vessels by the heart.
Instead, muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels.
The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along.
