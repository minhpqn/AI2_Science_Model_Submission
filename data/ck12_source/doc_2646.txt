Energy is released when an atom gains valence electrons and forms a negative ion.
Fill in the ionic bonding worksheet at the following URL.
What is an ionic bond?
How does it form?
Why do metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons in the formation of ionic bonds?
Atoms of lithium (Li) and cesium (Cs) both lose electrons and become positive ions when they from ionic bonds.
Which type of atom requires more energy to become an ion?
Why?
Describe ionic compounds and how they form.
Explain how ionic compounds are named.
Identify properties and uses of ionic compounds.
The truck pictured above is spreading crystals of the salt calcium chloride on a snowy road to prevent ice from forming.
The crystals lower the freezing point of water so when the snow melts, it wonâ€™t turn to ice.
Do you know why calcium chloride lowers the freezing point of water?
The answer has to do with the type of compound that calcium chloride is.
Calcium chloride is an ionic compound.
What Are Ionic Compounds?
All compounds form when atoms of different elements share or transfer electrons.
Compounds in which electrons are transferred from one atom to another are called ionic compounds .
In this type of compound, electrons actually move between the atoms, rather than being shared between them.
