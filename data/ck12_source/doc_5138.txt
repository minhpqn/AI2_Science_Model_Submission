Upon fertilization a diploid zygote is formed.
In humans, a zygote has 46 chromosomes, 23 inherited from each parent.
The gametes, sperm and eggs, are haploid cells, with 23 chromosomes each.
In humans, each set of chromosomes contains 22 autosomes and 1 sex chromosome .
Autosomes are chromosomes that are not directly involved in determining the sex of an individual.
The sex chromosomes contain genes that determine the sex of an individual.
Whereas autosomes are found as homologous pairs in somatic cells, sex chromosomes come in two different sizes, shapes, and contain different genes.
In many organisms, including humans, the sex chromosomes are known as the X and Y chromosomes.
The Y chromosome contains genes that cause male development.
Therefore, any individual with a Y chromosome is male, and a male will have both an X and Y chromosome (XY).
Females, without a Y chromosome, will have two X chromosomes (XX).
As females have two X chromosomes, they must pass an X chromosome to all of their children.
As males have both an X chromosome (inherited from their mother) and a Y chromosome, they can give either chromosome to their children.
If a child inherits a Y from his father, he will be male; if a child inherits an X from her father, she will be female.
It therefore is the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring.
