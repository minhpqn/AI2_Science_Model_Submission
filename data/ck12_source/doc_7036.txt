The atom often (but not always) turns into a different element during the decay process.
The amount of radiation given off by a certain sample of radioactive material depends on the amount of material, how quickly it decays, and the nature of the decay product.
Big, rapidly decaying samples are most dangerous.
The measure of how quickly a nucleus decays is given by the half-life of the nucleus.
One half-life is the amount of time it will take for half of the radioactive material to decay.
The type of atom is determined by the atomic number (i.e. the number of protons).
The atomic mass of an atom is approximately the number of protons plus the number of neutrons.
Typically, the atomic mass listed in a periodic table is an average, weighted by the natural abundances of different isotopes.
The atomic mass number in a nuclear decay process is conserved.
This means that you will have the same total atomic mass number on both sides of the equation.
Charge is also conserved in a nuclear process.
It is impossible to predict when an individual atom will decay; one can only predict the probability.
However, it is possible to predict when a portion of a macroscopic sample will decay extremely accurately because the sample contains a vast number of atoms.

After 6 seconds, the mass of a sample of radioactive material has reduced from 100 grams to 25 grams.
Its half-life must be
For any radioactive material, when does its half-life,
First decrease and then increase?
