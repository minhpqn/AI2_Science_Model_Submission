Finally, lizards and snakes went their separate ways about 150 million years ago.
Reptilian phylogenetic tree
Traditional Reptile Phylogenetic Tree.
This phylogenetic tree is based on physical traits of living and fossil reptiles.
Trees based on DNA comparisons may differ from the traditional tree and from each other, depending on the DNA sequences used.
Reptile evolution is currently an area of intense research and constant revision.
The earliest amniotes appeared about 350 million years ago, and the earliest reptiles evolved from a sauropsida ancestor by about 315 million years ago.
Dinosaurs evolved around 225 million years ago and dominated animal life on land until 65 million years ago, when they all went extinct.
Other reptiles survived and evolved into the classes of reptiles that exist today.
