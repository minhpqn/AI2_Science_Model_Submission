Metals tend to lose electrons to achieve this configuration.
Nonmetals tend to gain electrons to achieve this configuration.
Use the link below to answer the following questions:
Do most elements follow the octet rule?
How does hydrogen violate the octet rule?
Does sulfur always follow the octet rule?
What are free radicals?
What is the electron configuration of a noble gas?
Why is this configuration important?
How do metals change to obey the octet rule?
How do nonmetals change to obey the octet rule?
octet rule:
Atoms tend to form compounds in ways that give them eight valence electrons and thus the electron configuration of a noble gas.
Describe how cations are formed.
Write equations to illustrate cation formation.
Ion exchange resins remove cations from water
How are cations formed?
In many parts of the country, the water contains high concentrations of minerals that stain clothes, build up deposits on bathtubs and water heaters, and create problems with soap foaming properly.
This problem is caused by what is called “hard water.” The water contains excessive amounts of cations such as iron and calcium.
These ions create a lot of problems in the water.
