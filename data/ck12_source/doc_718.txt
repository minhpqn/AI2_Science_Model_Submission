In one of the experiments, yellow light is used, and in the other experiment, green light is used.
Green light has a shorter wavelength than yellow light.
Which of the following statements is true?
The two experiments will have the same distance between the central bright band and the first dark band.
The green light experiment will have a greater distance between the central bright band and the first dark band.
The yellow light experiment will have a greater distance between the central bright band and the first dark band.
Why are the edges of shadows often fuzzy?
Interference occurs on the wall on which the shadow is falling.
Light diffracts around the edges of the object casting the shadow.
The edges of the object casting the shadow is fuzzy.
Light naturally spreads out.
Monochromatic, coherent light passing through a double slit will produce exactly the same interference pattern as when it passes through a single slit.
If monochromatic light passes through a 0.050 mm slit and is projected onto a screen 0.70 m away with a distance of 8.00 mm between the central bright band and the first dark band, what is the wavelength of the light?
A krypton ion laser with a wavelength of 524.5 nm illuminates a 0.0450 mm wide slit.
If the screen is 1.10 m away, what is the distance between the central bright band and the first dark band?
Light from a He-Ne laser (\lambda = 632.8 \ nm)  falls on a slit of unknown width.
In the pattern formed on a screen 1.15 m away, the first dark band is 7.50 mm from the center of the central bright band.
How wide is the slit?
single slit interference:  When monochromatic, coherent light falls upon a small single slit it will produce a pattern of bright and dark fringes.
These fringes are due to light from one side of the slit interacting (interfering) with light from the other side.
