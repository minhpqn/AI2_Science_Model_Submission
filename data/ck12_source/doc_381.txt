The small intestine has three segments.
The ileum is the longest segment of the small intestine, which is well over 10 feet long.
The large intestine is about 5 feet long.

This drawing shows the major organs of the digestive system.
The liver, pancreas and gallbladder are also organs of the digestive system.
Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients.
There are two types of digestion, mechanical and chemical.
In mechanical digestion , large chunks of food are broken down into small pieces.
Mechanical digestion begins in the mouth and involves physical processes, such as chewing.
This process continues in the stomach as the food is mixed with digestive juices.
In chemical digestion , large food molecules are broken down into small nutrient molecules.
This is a chemical process which also begins in the mouth as saliva begins to break down food and continues in the stomach as stomach enzymes further digest the food.
Absorption is the process that allows substances you eat to be taken up by the blood.
After food is broken down into small nutrient molecules, the molecules are absorbed by the blood.
After absorption, the nutrient molecules travel in the bloodstream to cells throughout the body.
This happens mostly in the small intestine.
Some substances in food cannot be broken down into nutrients.
They remain behind in the digestive system after the nutrients are absorbed.
Any substances in food that cannot be digested and absorbed pass out of the body as solid waste.
