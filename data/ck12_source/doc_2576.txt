Watch the following video on classes of elements.
Then, using information from the video, make a table comparing and contrasting metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.

What are metalloids?
Which elements are placed in this class of elements?
Identify physical properties of metalloids that resemble those of metals.
Which physical property of metalloids is like that of nonmetals?
Explain the variation in how metalloids react with other elements.
Do a Web quest to learn more about semiconductors and why they are used in computer chips.
Summarize what you learn in a written report or poster.
Define valence electron.
Show how to represent valence electrons with electron dot diagrams.
Describe variation in valence electrons in the periodic table.
Relate valence electrons to reactivity and electrical conductivity of elements.
Did you ever play the card game called go fish?
Players try to form groups of cards of the same value, such as four sevens, with the cards they are dealt or by getting cards from other players or the deck.
This give and take of cards is a simple analogy for the way atoms give and take valence electrons in chemical reactions.
What Are Valence Electrons?
Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that can participate in interactions with other atoms.
Valence electrons are generally the electrons that are farthest from the nucleus.
