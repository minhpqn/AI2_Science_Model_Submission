Gills for gas exchange (but many exchange gas through their skin).
The segmentation of annelids is highly adaptive.
For one thing, it allows more efficient movement.
Each segment generally has its own nerve and muscle tissues.
Thus, localized muscle contractions can move just those segments needed for a particular motion.
Segmentation also allows an animal to have specialized segments to carry out particular functions.
This allows the whole animal to be more efficient.
Annelids have the amazing capacity to regrow segments that break off.
This is called regeneration.
Annelids have a variety of structures on the surface of their body for movement and other functions.
These vary, depending on the species.
Several of the structures are described in Figure below .

Annelid External Structures.
Many annelids have bristles and other types of external structures.
Each structure is not present in all species.
Most species of annelids can reproduce both asexually and sexually.
However, leeches can reproduce only sexually.
Asexual reproduction may occur by budding or fission.
Sexual reproduction varies by species.
