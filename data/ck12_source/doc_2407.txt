With Earth’s gravity, an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 2.2 lb.
How much does a 10 kg object weigh on Earth?
A:
A 10 kg object weighs ten times as much as a 1 kg object:
10 × 2.2 lb = 22 lb
Volume is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up.
The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m 3 ), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm 3 , and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL).
How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state.
The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder.
The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them.
The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from its dimensions.
For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height.
The volume of an irregularly shaped solid can be measured by the displacement method.
You can read below how this method works.

Q:
How could you find the volume of air in an otherwise empty room?
A:
If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume from its dimensions.
