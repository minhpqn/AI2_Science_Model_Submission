Solution: \frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f} plugging in values \frac{1}{40.0}+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{8.00}
Multiplying both sides by 40x  yields  x+40=5x so 4x = 40  and x = 10.0 \text{ cm} .
Example Problem:
An object 1.00 cm high is 8.00 cm to the left of a convex lens of 6.00 cm focal length.
Find the image location and image height.
Solution: \frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f} plugging in values \frac{1}{8.00}+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{6.00}
Multiplying both sides by 24x  yields 3x + 24 = 4x  so x = 24.0 \text{ cm} .
Since the image distance is three times the object distance, the image height will be three times the object height or 3.00 cm.
Lenses are made of transparent materials, such as glass or plastic, with an index of refraction greater than that of air.
One or both of the lens faces is part of a sphere and can be concave or convex.
A lens is called a convex lens if it is thicker at the center than at the edges.
Both the mirror equation and the magnification equation apply to lenses.
Generally, when dealing with lenses, the mirror equation is renamed the Lens Equation.
Double convex lenses have focal points on both sides of the lens; these and the points at twice the focal length are used to locate objects and images.
When the object is outside 2F , the image will be between F  and 2F  on the other side and will be inverted, diminished, and real.
If the object is placed between 2F  and F , the image will appear beyond 2F  on the other side.
The image will be real, inverted, and enlarged.
For convex lenses, when the object is placed inside F , the image will be on the same side of the lens as the object and it will be virtual, upright, and enlarged.
