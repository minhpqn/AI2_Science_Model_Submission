The first horizon is the “A“ horizon.
It is more commonly called the topsoil .
The topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil.
It is the layer with the most organic material.
Humus forms from all the plant and animal debris that falls to or grows on the ground.
The topsoil is also the region with the most biological activity.
Many organisms live within this layer.
Plant roots stretch down into this layer.
The roots help to hold the topsoil in place.
Topsoil is needed to grow most crops ( Figure below ).

Good topsoil is great for growing plants.
Topsoil usually does not have very small particles like clay.
Clay-sized particles are carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground.
Many minerals dissolve in the fresh water that moves through the topsoil.
These minerals are carried down to the lower layers of soil.
Below the topsoil is the “B“ horizon.
This is also called the subsoil .
Soluble minerals and clays accumulate in the subsoil.
Because it has less organic material, this layer is lighter brown in color than topsoil.
