Hydrogen is also very plentiful.
There is a huge amount of hydrogen in ocean water.
The hydrogen in just a gallon of water could produce as much energy by nuclear fusion as burning 1,140 liters (300 gallons) of gasoline!
The hydrogen in the oceans would generate enough energy to supply all the world’s people for a very long time.
Unfortunately, using energy from nuclear fusion is far from a reality.
Scientists are a long way from developing the necessary technology.
One problem is raising temperatures high enough for fusion to take place.
Another problem is that matter this hot exists only in the plasma state.
There are no known materials that can contain plasma, although a magnet might be able to do it.
That’s because plasma consists of ions and responds to magnetism.

In nuclear fusion, two or more small nuclei combine to form a single larger nucleus, a neutron, and a tremendous amount of energy.
Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium occurs naturally in the sun and other stars.
It takes place only at extremely high temperatures.
Scientists are searching for ways to create controlled nuclear fusion reactions in order to produce safe nuclear power.
Fusion involves only harmless, plentiful elements but requires extremely high temperatures.
