Why are your senses of taste and smell important?
Imagine you open a gallon of milk, and you suddenly smell a foul odor.
Your sense of smell has informed you that the milk has spoiled.
So you pour the spoiled milk down the kitchen sink.
Your sense of smell has possibly kept you from getting sick!
Taste and Smell
The senses of taste and smell are more complicated than many people might think and have a surprisingly large impact on behavior, perception and overall health.
Imagine your sense of smell disappearing as you age.
Though this doesn't usually happen, it could provide clues about diseases of the nervous system.
What about differences in taste?
Do all foods taste the same to all people?
Are there some foods you would never eat because you don't like the taste?
Does this food taste good to other people?
Genetic differences in taste could help predict what we eat, how well our metabolism works, and even whether or not we're overweight.
These two senses actually work together to provide some of the basic sensations of everyday life.
Your sense of taste is controlled by sensory neurons , or nerve cells, on your tongue that sense the chemicals in food.
The neurons are grouped in bundles within taste buds .
Each taste bud actually has a pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside.
There are five different types of taste neurons on the tongue.
Each type detects a different taste.
