Summarize reproduction in amphibians.
Outline development of amphibians.
Describe the amphibian tadpole.
What changes must occur for these tadpoles to move onto land?
These are tadpoles of the Yellow-Bellied Toad.
Of course these tadpoles are born in the water.
You can see the beginning of the formation of the hind limbs.
Amphibian Reproduction and Development
Amphibians reproduce sexually with either external or internal fertilization.
They attract mates in a variety of ways.
For example, the loud croaking of frogs is their mating call.
Each frog species has its own distinctive call that other members of the species recognize as their own.
Most salamanders use their sense of smell to find a mate.
The males produce a chemical odor that attracts females of the species.
Unlike other tetrapod vertebrates (reptiles, birds, and mammals), amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs.
Therefore, they must lay their eggs in water so they won’t dry out.
Their eggs are usually covered in a jelly-like substance, like the frog eggs shown in Figure below .
The “jelly” helps keep the eggs moist and offers some protection from predators.
Frog Eggs.
Frog eggs are surrounded by “jelly.” What is its function?
