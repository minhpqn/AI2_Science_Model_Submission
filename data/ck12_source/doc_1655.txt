No, not all animals have two parents.
When necessary, some animals can be produced from just one parent.
Some reptiles, such as this Komodo dragon, have only one parent.
The process of creating offspring from just one individual is called asexual reproduction.
Animals and other organisms cannot live forever.
They must reproduce if their species is to survive.
But what does it mean to reproduce?
Reproduction is the ability to make the next generation, and it is one of the basic characteristics of life.
Two methods of reproduction are:
Asexual reproduction , the process of forming a new individual from a single parent.
Sexual reproduction , the process of forming a new individual from two parents.
There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, but the result is always the same: a new life begins.
When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved.
DNA must be passed from both the mother and father to the child.
Humans cannot reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually.
But having just one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms, including some insects, fish, and reptiles.
These organisms can reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring ("children") have a single parent and share the exact same genetic material as the parent.
This is very different from reproduction in humans.
Bacteria, being a prokaryotic, single-celled organism, must reproduce asexually.
The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism.
