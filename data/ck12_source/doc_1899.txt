Be able to determine the relative ages of a set of rocks.
Understand the processes that can alter a set of rocks.
What are the relative ages of these rocks?
This photo shows rock layers and a fault—the fault is the large diagonal crack running through this rock.
These features can tell us several things about relative age.
Unless the rock was turned over somehow, we can assume that the layers on top are younger than the layers on the bottom.
Since the fault separates the layers, we can tell that the fault occurred after all the layers were deposited.
Determining the Relative Ages of Rocks
Steno’s principles are essential for determining the relative ages of rocks and rock layers.
Remember that in relative dating, scientists do not determine the exact age of a fossil or rock.
They look at a sequence of rocks to try to decipher when an event occurred relative to the other events represented in that sequence.
The relative age of a rock, then, is its age in comparison with other rocks. (1) Do you know which rock is older and which is younger? (2) Do you know how old the rock's layers are in years?
For relative ages, you know #1 but not
An interactive website on relative ages and geologic time is found here:
In some cases, it is very tricky to determine the sequence of events that leads to a certain formation.
In the picture below, can you figure out what happened in what order ( Figure below )?
Write it down and then check the following paragraphs.
