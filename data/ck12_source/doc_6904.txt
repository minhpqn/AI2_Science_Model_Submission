For instance, the fundamental standing sound wave produced in a tube closed at one end is shown below.
In this case, the amplitude of the standing wave is referring to the magnitude of the air pressure variations.
This standing wave is the first harmonic and one can see that the wavelength is \lambda = 4L .
Since v = \lambda f , the frequency of oscillation is f = v/4L .
In general, the frequency of oscillation is f = nv/4L , where n is always odd.
Question The objects A, B, and C below represent graduated cylinders of length 50 cm which are filled with water to the depths of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively as shown.
a) If you blow in each of these tubes, which (A,B,C) will produce the highest frequency sound?
b) What is the wavelength of the 1st harmonic (i.e. fundamental) of tube B?
c) The speed of sound at room temperature is about 343 m/s.
What is the frequency of the 1st harmonic for tube B?
a) The water forms the bottom of the tube and thus where the node of the wave will be.
Thus the air column is where the sound wave can exist.
The larger the air column, the larger the wavelength.
Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, thus the tube with the smallest air column will have the highest frequency.
So the answer is tube C.
b) The air column is 50 cm - 20 cm = 30 cm.
The first harmonic has a quarter wavelength in the tube.
Thus  \lambda = 4 \times L  .
Thus, \lambda = 4 \times 30 \text{cm} = 120 \text{cm}
c) Using the wave equation for the first harmonic (thus, n = 1) of a tube open at one end we get f = \frac{v}{4L} = \frac{343 \text{m/s}}{1.2 \text{m}}= 286 \text{Hz}
