They are found on each side of the head.
In some species, the tympanum is covered by skin.

How do Frogs Reproduce?
Frogs typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds, or lakes.
Their larvae, or tadpoles , have gills, a tail, but no legs, and need to live in water.
If fact, they are quite similar to a fish.
Tadpoles develop into adult frogs in water ( Figure below ).
During this transformation, they develop lungs, lose their tails and form their four legs.
You may hear males "ribbiting," producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding.
Frog calls can occur during the day or night.
Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals.
When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen.
This causes the female to release her eggs.
The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them.
The life cycle of a frog
Frogs develop from tadpoles, which develop from eggs.
Notice the formation of the two powerful back legs used for jumping.
