Initiation in Prokaryotes
The initiation of translation in prokaryotes involves the assembly of the ribosome and addition of the first amino acid, methionine.
The 30S ribosomal subunit attaches to the mRNA.
Next, the specific methionine tRNA is brought into the P.
The anticodon of this tRNA will bind to the AUG (start) codon on the mRNA.
This is the only time a tRNA will be brought into the P site; all successive tRNAâ€™s will be brought to the A site as translation continues.
The 50S ribosomal subunit then binds to the 30S subunit, completing the ribosome.
Initiation in Eukaryotes
The initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes is similar to that of prokaryotes with some minor modifications.
The 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail are involved in the recruitment of the ribosome.
In eukaryotes the ribosome scans along the mRNA for the first start methionine codon.
Translation may begin at all AUG codons, however only an in-frame AUG will produce a functional polypeptide.
The tRNAs with attached amino acids are delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes), which aid in decoding the mRNA codon sequence.

Elongation is fairly similar between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
As translation begins, the start tRNA is sitting on the AUG codon in the P site of the ribosome, so the next codon available to accept a tRNA is at the A site.
Elongation proceeds after initiation with the binding of an tRNA to the A site.
The next tRNA binds to the codon, bringing the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome, and a peptide bond joins between the start methionine and the next amino acid.
This reaction is catalyzed by the ribosome.
The new polypeptide chain is released from the initial tRNA.
