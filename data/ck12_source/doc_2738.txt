Identify shapes of saturated hydrocarbon molecules.
You can tell that this sponge is saturated with water because when it is squeezed, the water pours out.
When something is saturated with water, it already holds as much water as possible.
Compounds called hydrocarbons, which contain only carbon and hydrogen, can also be saturated, but not with water.
What Are Saturated Hydrocarbons?
Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds between carbon atoms.
They are the simplest class of hydrocarbons.
They are called saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen.
You can see an example of a saturated hydrocarbon in the Figure below .
In this compound, named ethane, each carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms.
In the structural formula, each dash (-) represents a single covalent bond, in which two atoms share one pair of valence electrons.
Ethane is a saturated hydrocarbon
Q:
What is the chemical formula for ethane?
A:
The chemical formula is C 2 H 6 .
What’s in a Name?
Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes .
The name of specific alkanes always ends in – ane .
