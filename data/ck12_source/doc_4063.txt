They decompose dead wood and other tough plant material.
Fungal hyphae are adapted to efficient absorption of nutrients from their environments, because hyphae have high surface area-to-volume ratios.
These adaptations are also complemented by the release of hydrolytic enzymes that break down large organic molecules such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids into smaller molecules.
These molecules are then absorbed as nutrients into the fungal cells.
One enzyme that is secreted by fungi is cellulase , which breaks down the polysaccharide cellulose .
Cellulose is a major component of plant cell walls.
In some cases, fungi have developed specialized structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts, which penetrate into the host cells for nutrient uptake by the fungus.
Fungal mycelia.
Fungi absorb nutrients from the environment through mycelia.
The branching mycelia have a high surface-area-to-volume ratio which allows for efficient absorption of nutrients.
Some fungi digest nutrients by releasing enzymes into the environment.
A mycorrhiza (Greek for "fungus roots") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant.
In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells.
This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis.
The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plantâ€™s root system.
The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.
Fungi are heterotrophic.
They get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from the environment.
Fungi, along with bacteria that are found in soil, are the primary decomposers of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems.
