What happens when chlorophyll is struck by sunlight?
What is the immediate fate of the energy absorbed by chlorophyll?
What is a by-product of the light reactions?
Summarize what happens during the light reactions of photosynthesis.
What is the chemiosmotic gradient?
Explain the role of the first electron transport chain in the formation of ATP during the light reactions of photosynthesis.
Write the overall photosynthesis equation.
Describe the function of the Calvin cycle.
Describe the roles of NADPH and ATP in the Calvin Cycle.
Summarize how photosynthesis stores energy in sugar.
Other than being green, what do all these fruits and vegetables have in common?
They are full of energy.
Energy in the form of glucose.
The energy from sunlight is briefly held in NADPH and ATP, which is needed to drive the formation of sugars such as glucose.
And this all happens in the Calvin cycle.
The Calvin Cycle
Making Food “From Thin Air”
You’ve learned that the first, light-dependent stage of photosynthesis uses two of the three reactants, water and light, and produces one of the products, oxygen gas (a waste product of this process).
All three necessary conditions are required – chlorophyll pigments, the chloroplast “theater,” and enzyme catalysts.
The first stage transforms light energy into chemical energy, stored to this point in molecules of ATP and NADPH.
