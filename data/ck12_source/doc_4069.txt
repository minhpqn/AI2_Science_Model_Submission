How are they classified?
Classification of Fungi
For a long time, scientists considered fungi to be members of the plant kingdom because they have obvious similarities with plants.
Both fungi and plants are immobile, have cell walls, and grow in soil.
Some fungi, such as lichens , even look like plants (see Figure below ).

The Kingdom Fungi
Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants.
We now know that they have unique physical, chemical, and genetic traits that set them apart from plants and other eukaryotes.
For example, the cell walls of fungi are made of chitin , not cellulose.
Also, fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms, whereas plants make their own food.
These are just a few of the reasons fungi are now placed in their own kingdom.
Classification of fungi below the level of the kingdom is controversial.
There is no single, widely-accepted system of fungal classification.
Most classifications include several phyla (the next major taxon below the kingdom).
Three of the most common phyla are compared in Table below .
