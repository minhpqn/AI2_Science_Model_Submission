Their 40S subunit has an 18S RNA (1900 nucleotides) and 33 proteins.
The large subunit is composed of a 5S RNA (120 nucleotides), 28S RNA (4700 nucleotides), a 5.8S RNA (160 nucleotides) subunits and about 49 proteins.
The ribosomes found in chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotes also consist of large and small subunits bound together with proteins into one 70S particle.
These organelles are believed to be descendants of bacteria and as such their ribosomes are similar to those of bacteria.
ribonucleoprotein :
A nucleoprotein that contains RNA; includes the ribosome, vault ribonucleoproteins, and small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs).
ribosome :
A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).
ribozyme :
An RNA molecule with a tertiary structure that enables it to catalyze a chemical reaction.
Svedberg unit :
A non-SI unit for sedimentation rate; technically a measure of time that offers a measure of particle size; 10 -13 seconds (100 fs).
translation :
The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.
Ribosomes are small organelles and are the site of protein synthesis.
They are found in all cells.
Ribosomes are composed of a large and small subunit.
Prtokaryotic ane eukaryotic ribosomal subunits differ in size.
What is the role of the ribosome?
What is a significant difference between the structure of a ribosome and other organelles?
