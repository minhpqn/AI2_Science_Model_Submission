The potential difference in the case of moving a wire through a magnetic field is produced by the work done on the charges by whatever is pushing the wire through the field.
The  EMF (or voltage) depends on the magnetic field strength, B , the length of the wire in the magnetic field, l , and the velocity of the wire in the field.
EMF = Blv
This calculation is based on the wire moving perpendicularly through the field.
If the wire moves an angle to the field, then only the component of the wire perpendicular to the field will generate EMF .
Example Problem:
A 0.20 m piece of wire that is part of a complete circuit moves perpendicularly through a magnetic field whose magnetic induction is 0.0800 T.
If the speed of the wire is 7.0 m/s, what  EMF is induced in the wire?
Solution:
EMF = Blv = (0.0800 \ N/A \cdot m)(0.20 \ m)(7.0 \ m/s) = 0.11 \ N \cdot m/C = 0.11 \ J/C = 0.11 \ V
If a wire that is part of a complete circuit is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts a force on the individual electrons in the wire, which causes a current to flow.
