The number of neutrons, N , is N = A - Z .
Nuclei that have the same number of protons in the nucleus but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes.
Each element has its own square in the periodic table.
Each elemental square on the periodic table contains the chemical symbol for the element, the atomic number, and the atomic weight.
The atomic weight of an element is a weighted average of its isotopes.
Follow up questions:
Nucleus #1 has 6 protons and a mass number of 14 while nucleus #2 has 7 protons and a mass number of 14.  Are these isotopes or are they nuclei of different elements?
Nucleus #1 has 5 protons and a mass number of 12 while nucleus #2 has 5 protons and a mass number of 13.  Are these isotopes or are they nuclei of different elements?
What do different isotopes of a given element have in common?
How are they different?
What is the element name of the atom represented by ^{232}_{92} X ?
How many protons and how many neutrons does the nucleus in problem #2 have?
Using the following data, calculate the atomic weight of magnesium.
Magnesium-24 = 78.70%
Magnesium-25 = 10.13%
Magnesium-26 = 11.17%
nucleus:
The nucleus is the very dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom.
neutron:
A neutron is an uncharged elementary particle that has a mass nearly equal to that of the proton and is present in all known atomic nuclei except the hydrogen-1 atom.
