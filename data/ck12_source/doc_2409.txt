Physical Properties of Matter
Define physical property.
Give examples of physical properties of matter.
Both of these people are participating in a board sport, but the man on the left is snowboarding in Norway while the woman on the right is sandboarding in Dubai.
Snow and sand are both kinds of matter, but they have different properties.
What are some ways snow and sand differ?
One difference is the temperature at which they melt.
Snow melts at 0°C, whereas sand melts at about 1600°C!
The temperature at which something melts is its melting point.
Melting point is just one of many physical properties of matter.
What Are Physical Properties?
Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to an entirely different substance.
Physical properties are typically things you can detect with your senses.
For example, they may be things that you can see, hear, smell, or feel.
