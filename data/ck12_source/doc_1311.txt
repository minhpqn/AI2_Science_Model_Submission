Damage due to the Good Friday Earthquake in Alaska
The 1964 Good Friday Earthquake centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska released the second most amount of energy of any earthquake in recorded history.

Great Indian Ocean Earthquake
Nearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of plate boundaries.
About 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin because it is lined with convergent and transform boundaries ( Figure below ).
The region around the Pacific is called the Pacific Ring of Fire due to its earthquakes and volcanoes.
About 15% take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt.
Convergence is causing the Indian Plate to run into the Eurasian Plate.
The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries.
A few earthquakes take place away from plate boundaries.
These are intraplate earthquakes.
Map of strong earthquake epicenters
Earthquake epicenters for magnitude 8.0 and greater events since 1900.
The earthquake depth shows that most large quakes are shallow focus, but some subducted plates cause deep focus quakes.
Small earthquakes are extremely common, but the largest earthquakes are extremely rare.
The vast majority of earthquakes happen at plate boundaries.
The Pacific Ocean basin has the most earthquakes due to convergent and transform plate boundaries.
The Himalaya region has the second most due to the convergence of India and Asia.
