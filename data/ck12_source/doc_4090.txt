Bird #3 is able to pull small seeds out of small spaces.
In his diary, Darwin pointed out how each animal is well-suited for its particular environment.
The shapes of the finch beaks on each island were well-matched with the seeds available on that island, but not the seeds on other islands.
For example, a larger and stronger beak was needed to break open large seeds on one island, and a small beak was needed to eat the small seeds on a different island.
Charles Darwin developed what we now call "the theory of evolution by natural selection."
Darwin's observations on the Galápagos Islands suggested that animals are well-suited for their specific environments.
