The Genetic Code - Advanced
Explain how the Genetic Code is a three letter code, and describe its role in translating nucleotides into amino acids.
Explain that a reading frame is the group of three bases in which the mRNA is read, and describe how interrupting the reading frame may have severe consequences on the protein.
Discuss what is meant by the universal genetic code.
How do you go from four nucleotide letters to 20 amino acids?
You need a code.
And the code that changes the information embedded in DNA and RNA into ordered amino acids and proteins is the genetic code.
And every living organism uses the same genetic code.
The Genetic Code
So how exactly is the language of nucleotides used to code for the language of amino acids?
How can a code of only As, Cs, Gs, and Us carry information for 20 different amino acids?
The genetic code is the code in which the language of nucleotides is used to create the language of amino acids.
Cracking the Code
A code of at least three letters has to be the answer.
A one letter code would only be able to code for four amino acids.
A two letter code could only code for 16 amino acids.
With a three letter code, there are 64 possibilities.
