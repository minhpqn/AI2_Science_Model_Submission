Make a table comparing and contrasting vaporization and evaporation.
Define boiling point.
What is the boiling point of pure water?
Suppose you place an aluminum pot containing water over the flame on a stovetop.
Before long, the water starts boiling and turning to water vapor.
The pot becomes very hot but otherwise appears to be unchanged by the increase in temperature.
Based on these observations, what can you conclude about the boiling point of aluminum?
Define evaporation, and describe how it occurs.
Identify factors that affect the rate of evaporation.
Explain evaporative cooling.
The clothes on this clothesline are soaking wet, but before too long they will be completely dry.
How does this happen?
Where does the water go?
And what factors might help the clothes on the line dry more quickly?
From Liquid to Gas Without Boiling
Evaporation explains why clothes dry on a clothesline.
Evaporation is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas without becoming hot enough to boil.
It occurs when individual liquid particles at the exposed surface of the liquid absorb just enough energy to overcome the force of attraction with other liquid particles.
If the surface particles are moving in the right direction, they will pull away from the liquid and move into the air.
This is illustrated in the Figure below .
