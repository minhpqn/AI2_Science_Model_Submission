This process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after its discover, Melvin Calvin.
The Calvin cycle uses CO 2 and the energy temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH to make the sugar glucose.
Diagram of the steps of photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a two stage process.
As is depicted here, the energy from sunlight is needed to start photosynthesis.
The initial stage is called the light reactions as they occur only in the presence of light.
During these initial reactions, water is used and oxygen is released.
The energy from sunlight is converted into a small amount of ATP and an energy carrier called NADPH.
Together with carbon dioxide, these are used to make glucose (sugar) through a process called the Calvin Cycle.
NADP + and ADP (and Pi, inorganic phosphate) are regenerated to complete the process.
Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast of the plant cell.
Carbon dioxide, water, and the sun's energy are necessary for the chemical reactions of photosynthesis.
The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen.
