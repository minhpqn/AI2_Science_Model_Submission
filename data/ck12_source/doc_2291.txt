Introduction to Physical Science
Are you curious about other planets?
Did you ever wish you could explore them like the Mars rover in this picture?
If so, then you’re thinking like a scientist.
Scientists are curious about things in nature, and they do investigations to better understand them.
They often use technology—from microscopes to Mars rovers—to extend their own senses so they can learn even more.
In this unit, you’ll read about how scientists think and how they investigate and explore the natural world.
Nature of Science
Explain the goal of science.
Describe how science advances knowledge.
Design a scientific experiment.
Does the word science make you think of high-tech labs and researchers in white coats like the ones in this picture?
This is often an accurate image of science but not always.
If you look up science in a dictionary, you would find that it comes from a Latin word that means “having knowledge.” However, this isn’t an adequate definition either.
What Is Science?
Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having knowledge.
Science is a way of learning about the natural world that is based on evidence and logic.
In other words, science is a process, not just a body of facts.
Through the process of science, our knowledge of the world advances.
