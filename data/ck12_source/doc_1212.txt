Fossils can be pieces of the organism, like bones.
They can also be traces of the organism, like footprints.
Sediments are transported by water, wind, ice, or gravity.
These agents move them from the place where they formed.
The sediments are then deposited in a location.
Sediments will eventually settle out of water ( Figure below ).
For example, rivers carry lots of sediment.
Where the water slows, it dumps these sediments along its banks, into lakes and the ocean.
Cobbles, pebbles, and sand on a beach are all sediments
Cobbles, pebbles, and sands are the sediments that are seen on this beach.
When sediments settle out of water, they form horizontal layers.
A layer of sediment is deposited.
Then the next layer is deposited on top of that layer.
So each layer in a sedimentary rock is younger than the layer under it ( Figure below ).
Rock layers on top of the Grand Canyon are newer than the bottom ones
The rock layers at the Grand Canyon are horizontal.
We know that layers at the bottom are older than layers at the top.
Sediments are deposited in many different types of environments.
Beaches and deserts collect large deposits of sand.
Sediments also end up at the bottom of the ocean and in lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, and swamps.
