Many prokaryotes have an extra layer, called a capsule, outside the cell wall.
The capsule protects the cell from chemicals and from drying out.
It also allows the cell to stick to surfaces and to other cells.
Because of this, many prokaryotes can form biofilms, like the one shown in Figure below .
A biofilm is a colony of prokaryotes that is stuck to a surface such as a rock or a host’s tissues.
The sticky plaque that collects on your teeth between brushings is a biofilm.
It consists of millions of bacteria.
Most prokaryotes also have long, thin protein structures called flagella (singular, flagellum ).
They extend from the plasma membrane.
Flagella help prokaryotes move.
They spin around a fixed base, causing the cell to roll and tumble.
As shown in Figure below , prokaryotes may have one or more flagella.

The greatly magnified biofilm shown here was found on a medical catheter (tubing) removed from a patient’s body.

Flagella in prokaryotes may be located at one or both ends of the cell or all around it.
They help prokaryotes move toward food or away from toxins.
Many organisms form spores for reproduction.
