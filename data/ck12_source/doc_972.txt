Laser light is highly directional because of the parallel mirrors.
The laser beam is very small, typically around  \frac{1}{2} mm in diameter.
The light is monochromatic , coherent, and very intense.
The concentrated power of laser light is used in a variety of ways.
In medicine, lasers can be used to repair the retina in an eye.
Lasers can also be used in surgery in place of a knife to cut flesh with little loss of blood (the laser cauterizes as it cuts).
In industry, lasers are used to cut steel and to weld materials together.
Lasers may, in the future, be used to start nuclear fusion reactions.
The word laser is an acronym.
It stands for L ight A mplification by S timulated E mission of R adiation.
A continuous electric discharge like that in a neon sign can be used to put atoms in the excited state.
The helium-neon lasers often seen in science classrooms and used as laser pointers are continuous lasers.
The photons emitted by the atoms are collected by placing the glass tube containing the atoms between two parallel mirrors.
One mirror reflects all the light striking it while the other mirror allows some small percentage of the light to pass through.
The light which passes out of the tube produces the laser beam.
The light from a laser is monochromatic, coherent, and very intense.
