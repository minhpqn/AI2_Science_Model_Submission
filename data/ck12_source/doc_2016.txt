Living Things in the Ocean
Marine organisms range in size from tiny bacteria to the largest known animal, the blue whale.
All are adapted for life in salt water.
Most are adapted for extreme pressures.
When you think of life in the ocean, do you think of fish?
Actually, fish are not the most common life forms in the ocean.
Plankton are the most common.
Plankton make up one of three major groups of marine life.
The other two groups are nekton and benthos ( Figure below ).
Plankton, nekton, and benthos are the three groups of living things in the oceans
Living things in the oceans are placed in these three groups.
Plankton are living things that float in the water.
Most plankton are too small to see with the unaided eye ( Figure below ).
Plankton are unable to move on their own.
Ocean motions carry them along.
There are two main types of plankton:
Phytoplankton are “plant-like” plankton.
Since they make food by photosynthesis, they live in the photic zone.
Most are algae.
Zooplankton are “animal-like” plankton that include tiny animals and fish larvae.
