As the cartilage with this abnormal protein is the precursor to bone formation, this process is hindered, and these children have severe phenotypes.
Some mutations lead to death in utero .
Similar dominant negative mutations are characteristic of the type I collagen disorders and the Osteogenesis Imperfecta phenotypes, which are also known as Brittle-Bone sides.

chromosomal alteration :
A large change in chromosome structure.
constitutively :
Always on under all conditions; usually due to a mutation; such as when a receptor is active even without the binding of its ligand.
dominant negative mutations :
Mutation that results in an altered gene product that acts in a dominant manner to the wild-type gene product.
frameshift mutation :
Mutations which alter the mRNA reading frame.
gain-of-function mutation :
Mutation that results in the gene product or protein having a new and abnormal function.
germline mutation :
Mutation in the DNA within a gamete; can be passed on to descendents.
haploinsufficiency :
Occurs when not enough gene product is produced; characteristic of occurances when a diploid organism only has a single functional copy of a gene.
loss-of-function mutation :
Mutation that results in a gene product or protein having less or no function.
