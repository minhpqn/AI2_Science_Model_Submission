Magnetite crystals in fresh volcanic rocks point to the current magnetic north pole ( Figure below ).
Location of the Earth's current north magnetic pole
Earthâ€™s current north magnetic pole is in northern Canada.
Older rocks that are the same age and are on the same continent point to the same location.
However, the location they point to is not the current north magnetic pole.
Older rocks that are different ages and are on the same continent do not point to the same location.
None of them point to the current magnetic north pole.
Rocks on different continents that are the same age point to different locations.
Only recent rocks point to the current north magnetic pole.
How did the geologists explain this?
There is only one logical explanation.
There was almost certainly only one north magnetic pole through Earth's history.
The north magnetic pole is very likely in the same spot it has always been.
If these two things are true, then the continents have moved.
Support for Wegener's Idea
Geologist tested the idea that the pole remained fixed but the continents moved.
They fitted the continents together as Wegener had done.
They moved them into the positions where they had been at the time the magnetite crystals cooled.
The magnetite crystals pointed to the current north magnetic pole ( Figure below ).
The magnetic pole seemed to have moved, but had not.
