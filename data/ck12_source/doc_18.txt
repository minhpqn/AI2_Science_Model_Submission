Explain your resoning fully.
What is the difference between basic and applied science?
What is an example of applied science?
Describe how microscopes are used in the life sciences.
Identify how cells were first identified.
How can we see the details of bacteria?
With the naked eye, bacteria just look like a slimy smear on a petri dish.
How can we study them in more detail?
The invention of the microscope has allowed us to see bacteria, cells, and other things too small to be seen with the naked eye.
Microscopes, tools that you may get to use in your class, are some of the most important tools in biology ( Figure below ).
A microscope is a tool used to make things that are too small to be seen by the human eye look bigger.
Microscopy is the study of small objects using microscopes.
Look at your fingertips.
Before microscopes were invented in 1595, the smallest things you could see on yourself were the tiny lines in your skin.
