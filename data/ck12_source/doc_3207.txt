How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its pitch.
Pitch, in turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves.
High-frequency sound waves produce high-pitched sounds, and low-frequency sound waves produce low-pitched sounds.
Infrasound has wave frequencies too low for humans to hear.
Ultrasound has wave frequencies too high for humans to hear.

What is the pitch of sound?
How is the pitch of sound related to the frequency of sound waves?
Define infrasound and ultrasound.
Describe the Doppler effect.
Explain why the Doppler effect occurs.
Has this ever happened to you?
You hear a siren from a few blocks away.
The source is a police car that is racing in your direction.
As the car approaches, zooms past you, and then speeds off into the distance, the sound of its siren keeps changing in pitch.

Do you know why this happens?
The answer is the Doppler effect.
