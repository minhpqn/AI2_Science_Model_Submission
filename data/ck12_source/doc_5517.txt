physical chemistry:  The study of the both the macroscopic and the atomic properties and phenomena in chemical systems.
organic chemistry:  The study of carbon-containing chemicals.
Carbon is one of the most abundant elements on Earth and is capable of forming a tremendously vast number of chemicals (over twenty million so far).
inorganic chemistry:
The study of chemicals that do not, in general, contain carbon.
analytical chemistry:
The study of the composition of matter, focusing on separating, identifying, and quantifying chemicals in samples of matter.
biochemistry:
The study of chemical processes that occur in living things.
