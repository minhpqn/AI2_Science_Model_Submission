Can you guess what it is?
Itâ€™s a model of a certain type of matter.
Some types of matter are elements, or pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances.
Many other types of matter are compounds.
The model above represents a compound.
The compound it represents is carbon dioxide, a gas you exhale each time you breathe.
What Is a Compound?
A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically.
For example, the compound carbon dioxide forms when one atom of carbon (grey in the model above) combines with two atoms of oxygen (red in the model).
Another example of a compound is water.
It forms when two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom.
