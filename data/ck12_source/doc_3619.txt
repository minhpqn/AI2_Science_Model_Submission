Outline the stages of meiosis.
Describe how chromosomes separate in meiosis I and meiosis II.
How do you make a cell with half the DNA?
Meiosis.
This allows cells to have half the number of chromosomes, so two of these cells can come back together to form a new organism with the complete number of chromosomes.
This process not only helps produce gametes, it also ensures genetic variation.
The process that produces haploid gametes is meiosis.
Meiosis is a type of cell division in which the number of chromosomes is reduced by half.
It occurs only in certain special cells of the organisms.
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate, and haploid cells form that have only one chromosome from each pair.
Two cell divisions occur during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced.
The two cell divisions are called meiosis I and meiosis II.
The overall process of meiosis is summarized in Figure below .

An illustrated overview of meiosis
Overview of Meiosis.
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different daughter cells.
This diagram shows just the nuclei of the cells.
Notice the exchange of genetic material that occurs prior to the first cell division.
