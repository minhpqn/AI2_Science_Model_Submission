The weak nuclear force is transferred by the exchange of force-carrying fundamental particles called W and Z bosons.
This force is also a very short-range force that works only within the nucleus of the atom.
It is much weaker than the strong force or electromagnetic force that are also at work inside the atom.
Unlike these other two forces, the weak nuclear force does not bind subatomic particles together in an atom.
Instead, it changes subatomic particles from one type to another.
The Figure below shows one way this can happen.
In this figure, an up quark in a proton is changed by the weak force to a down quark.
This changes the proton (uud) to a neutron (udd).

Q:
If the weak force causes a proton to change to a neutron, how does this change the atom?
A:
The resulting atom represents a different element.
Thatâ€™s because each element has a unique number of protons.
For example, all atoms of helium have two protons.
If one of the protons in a helium atom changes to a neutron, the resulting atom would have just one proton, so the atom would no longer be a helium atom.
Instead it would be a hydrogen atom, because all hydrogen atoms have a single proton.
The electromagnetic force of attraction between negative electrons and positive protons in the nucleus keeps electrons in the area surrounding the nucleus.
The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positive protons in the nucleus is overcome by the strong nuclear force between protons and neutrons.
This force holds the nucleus together.
