The poles are often mapped this way to avoid distortion.
A gnomic projection is best for use over a small area.
A gnomonic projection places a flat piece of paper on a point somewhere on Earth and projects an image from that point

In 1963, Arthur Robinson made a map with more accurate sizes and shapes of land areas.
He did this using mathematical formulas.
The formulas could directly translate coordinates onto the map.
This type of projection is shaped like an oval rather than a rectangle ( Figure below ).
A Robinson projection better represents the true shapes and sizes of land areas
A Robinson projection better represents the true shapes and sizes of land areas.
Robinson’s map is more accurate than a Mercator projection.
The shapes and sizes of continents are closer to true.
Robinson's map is best within 45° of the Equator.
Distances along the Equator and the lines parallel to it are true.
However, the scales along each line of latitude are different.
In 1988, the National Geographic Society began to use Robinson’s projection for its world maps.
A map projection is a way to show a three-dimensional figure in two dimensions.
All map projections have some distortion.
Different types have distortions in different locations and of different amounts.
Robinson's project is different from the rest because it uses mathematical formulas.
