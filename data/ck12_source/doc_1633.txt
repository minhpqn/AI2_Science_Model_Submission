How does the food you eat provide energy?
When you need a quick boost of energy, you might reach for an apple or a candy bar.
But cells do not "eat" apples or candy bars; these foods need to be broken down so that cells can use them.
Through the process of cellular respiration , the energy in food is changed into energy that can be used by the body's cells.
Initially, the sugars in the food you eat are digested into the simple sugar glucose , a monosaccharide .
Recall that glucose is the sugar produced by the plant during photosynthesis.
The glucose, or the polysaccharide made from many glucose molecules, such as starch , is then passed to the organism that eats the plant.
This organism could be you, or it could be the organism that you eat.
Either way, it is the glucose molecules that holds the energy.
Specifically, during cellular respiration, the energy stored in glucose is transferred to ATP ( Figure below ).
ATP , or adenosine triphosphate, is chemical energy the cell can use.
It is the molecule that provides energy for your cells to perform work, such as moving your muscles as you walk down the street.
But cellular respiration is slightly more complicated than just converting the energy from glucose into ATP.
Cellular respiration can be described as the reverse or opposite of photosynthesis.
During cellular respiration, glucose, in the presence of oxygen, is converted into carbon dioxide and water.
Recall that carbon dioxide and water are the starting products of photosynthesis.
What are the products of photosynthesis?
The process can be summarized as: glucose + oxygen â†’ carbon dioxide + water.
During this process, the energy stored in glucose is transferred to ATP.
Energy is stored in the bonds between the phosphate groups (PO 4 - ) of the ATP molecule.
