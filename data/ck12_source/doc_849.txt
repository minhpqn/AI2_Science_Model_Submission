Could decomposers be added to a food chain?
Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms, so simple food chains are rare in nature.
There are also many different species of fish and sharks.
So a food chain cannot end with a shark; it must end with a distinct species of shark.
A food chain does not contain the general category of "fish," it will contain specific species of fish.
In ecosystems, there are many food chains.
Since feeding relationships are so complicated, we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem.
A food web ( Figure below ) shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem.
If you expand our original example of a food chain, you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks.
A food web shows many more arrows, but still shows the flow of energy.
A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships.

A food chain is a diagram that shows feeding interactions in an ecosystem through a single pathway.
A food web is a diagram that shows feeding interactions between many organisms in an ecosystem through multiple intersecting pathways.
