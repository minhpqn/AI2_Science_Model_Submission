Which mechanism(s) is/are the most important influences on evolution?
Identify the four forces of evolution.
Why is mutation needed for evolution to occur, even though it usually has little effect on allele frequencies?
What is founder effect?
Give an example.
Explain why genetic drift is most likely to occur in a small population.
Describe natural selection.
Explain how new species may originate.
Discuss how natural selection can keep a harmful allele in a gene pool.
Summarize natural selection for polygenic traits.
Distinguish stabilizing selection from directional selection and from disruptive selection.
Does this type of fitness have anything to do with natural selection?
Usually not.
There are countless ways in which an organism can be more "fit," or better adapted to its habitat.
And we probably do not know about most of these adaptations.
Natural selection occurs when there are differences in fitness among members of a population.
As a result, some individuals pass more genes to the next generation.
This causes allele frequencies to change.
Sickle Cell and Natural Selection
The example of sickle-cell anemia is described in the Figure below and Table below .
