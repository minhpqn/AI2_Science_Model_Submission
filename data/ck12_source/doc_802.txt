Clumped species are closer together, which allows for easier reproduction
Clumped species are closer together.
This may allow for easier reproduction.
These cacti are dispersed due to competition for water
A population of cacti in the Sonoran Desert generally shows even dispersion due to competition for water.
Ecologists also study the birth and death rates of the population.
Together these give the growth rate (the birth rate minus the death rate), which tells how fast (or slow) the population size is changing.
The birth rate is the number of births within a population during a specific time period.
The death rate is the number of deaths within a population during a specific time period.
Knowing the birth and death rates of populations gives you information about a populationâ€™s health.
For example, when a population is made up of mostly young organisms and the birth rate is high, the population is growing.
A population with equal birth and death rates will remain the same size.
Populations that are decreasing in size have a higher death rate than birth rate.
A population is a group of organisms of the same species, all living in the same area and interacting with each other.
Scientists can study many aspects of a population, including density, dispersion, and birth and death rates.
