What does Le Châtelier’s principle state?
If the forward reaction is favored in the equilibrium, what will increase?
If the reverse reaction is favored in the equilibrium, what will increase?
Le Châtelier’s principle:
When a chemical system that is at equilibrium is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond in order to relieve the stress.
Effect of Concentration
Describe the effects of concentration changes on the equilibrium of a reaction.
The pH in a solution can be influenced by the addition or removal of H+ ions
Phenolphthalein is one of those chemicals that has one structure in a high acid environment and another structure in a low acid environment.
If the hydrogen ion concentration is high, the compound is colorless, but turns red if the hydrogen ion concentration is low.
By adding hydrogen ions to the solution or removing them through a chemical reaction, we can vary the color of the dye.
Effect of Concentration
A change in concentration of one of the substances in an equilibrium system typically involves either the addition or the removal of one of the reactants or products.
Consider the Haber-Bosch process for the industrial production of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gases.
\text{N}_2(g)+3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftarrows 2\text{NH}_3(g)
If the concentration of one substance in a system is increased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that removes that substance.
When more N 2 is added, the forward reaction will be favored because the forward reaction uses up N 2 and converts it to NH 3 .
The forward reaction speeds up temporarily as a result of the addition of a reactant.
The position of equilibrium shifts as more NH 3 is produced.
The concentration of NH 3 increases, while the concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease.
