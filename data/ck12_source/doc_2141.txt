It is possible for a nation rich in a resource to control who gets it.
They can also control the price.
Who Uses Natural Resources?
Rich nations use more natural resources than poor nations.
In fact, the richest 20 percent of people use 85 percent of the world’s resources.
What about the poorest 20 percent of people?
They use only 1 percent of the world's resources ( Figure below ).
Graph of oil consumption per capita
The U.S. uses more than its share of oil.
What if everyone used resources this way?
We would need five times more space to produce what was used! (Note:
Per capita means “per person.”)
More People, More Resources
Every 20 minutes, the human population adds 3,500 more people.
More people need more resources.
For example, we now use five times more fossil fuels than we did in 1970.
The human population is expected to increase for at least 40 years.
What will happen to resource use?
The availability of a resource depends on how much of it there is, how much it costs to get, and where it is located.
Politics plays an important role in resource availability.
