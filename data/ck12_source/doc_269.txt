the rifle has a great deal more mass than the bullet.
the momentum of the rifle is unchanged.
the impulse on the rifle is less than the impulse on the bullet.
none of these.
Law of Conservation of Momentum:
The total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant regardless of changes within the system.
Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions
Use the conservation of momentum and vector analysis to solve two-dimensional collision problems.
Review vector components.
Billiards involves collisions in two dimensions
In a game of billiards, it is important to be able to visualize collisions in two dimensions â€“ the best players not only know where the target ball is going but also where the cue ball will end up.
Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions
Conservation of momentum in all closed systems is valid, regardless of the directions of the objects before and after they collide.
Most objects are not confined to a single line, like trains on a rail.
Rather, many objects, like billiard balls or cars, can move in two dimensions.
Conservation of momentum for these objects can also be calculated; momentum is a vector and collisions of objects in two dimensions can be represented by axial vector components.
To review axial components, revisit Vectors:
