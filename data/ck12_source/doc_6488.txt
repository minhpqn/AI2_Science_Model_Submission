The voltage produced by a fresh dry cell is 1.5 V, but decreases during use.
An alkaline battery is a variation on the zinc-carbon dry cell.
The alkaline battery has no carbon rod and uses a paste of zinc metal and potassium hydroxide instead of a solid metal anode.
The cathode half-reaction is the same, but the anode half-reaction is different.
Anode (oxidation): \text{Zn}(s) + \text{2O}H^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn(OH)}_2(s) + 2e^-
Advantages of the alkaline battery are that it has a longer shelf life and the voltage does not decrease during use.
Lead Storage Batteries
A battery is a group of electrochemical cells combined together as a source of direct electric current at a constant voltage.
Dry cells are not true batteries since they are only one cell.
The lead storage battery is commonly used as the power source in cars and other vehicles.
It consists of six identical cells joined together, each of which has a lead anode and a cathode made of lead(IV) oxide (PbO 2 ) packed on a metal plate.
Lead storage batteries are reusable batteries found in cars
A lead storage battery, such as those used in cars, consists of six identical electrochemical cells and is rechargeable.
The cathode and anode are both immersed in an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, which acts as the electrolyte.
The cell reactions are:
& \text{Anode (oxidation):} && \text{Pb}(s) + \text{SO}{_4}^{2-}(aq) \rightarrow \text{PbSO}_4(s) + 2e^- \\& \text{Cathode (reduction):} && \text{PbO}_2(s) + 4\text{H}^+ + \text{SO}{_4}^{2-}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{PbSO}_4(s) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \\\hline& \text{Overall:} && \text{Pb}(s) + \text{PbO}_2(s) + 4\text{H}^+(aq) + 2\text{SO}{_4}^{2-}(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{PbSO}_4(s) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
Each cell in a lead storage battery produces 2 V, so a total of 12 V is generated by the entire battery.
This is used to start a car or power other electrical systems.
Unlike a dry cell, the lead storage battery is rechargeable.
Note that the forward redox reaction generates solid lead(II) sulfate which slowly builds up on the plates.
