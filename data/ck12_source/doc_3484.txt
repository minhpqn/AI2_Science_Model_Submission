The type of bond that forms between molecules is called a hydrogen bond .
Bonds between molecules are not as strong as bonds within molecules.
There are just many more hydrogen bonds in water (between water molecules) than there are covalent bonds within a molecule.
The hydrogen bonds may not be strong, but in water they are strong enough to hold together nearby molecules.

Hydrogen Bonding in Water Molecules.
Hydrogen bonds form between nearby water molecules.
How do you think this might affect water’s properties?
Properties of Water
Hydrogen bonds between water molecules explain some of water’s properties.
For example, hydrogen bonds explain why water molecules tend to stick together.
Have you ever watched water drip from a leaky faucet or from a melting icicle?
If you have, then you know that water always falls in drops rather than as separate molecules.
The dew drops in Figure below are another example of water molecules sticking together.

Drops of dew cling to a spider web in this picture.
Can you think of other examples of water forming drops? (Hint:
What happens when rain falls on a newly waxed car?)
Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F).
