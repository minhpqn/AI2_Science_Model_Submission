Electrons have a much lower wavelength, which makes it possible to get a resolution a thousand times better than with a light microscope.
The TEM allows scientists to study the topographical, morphological, compositional and crystalline details in the cell or different materials near the atomic levels, as seen in the Figure below .
Development of the TEM was quickly followed in 1935 by the development of the scanning electron microscope (SEM).
The SEM forms an image of a sample by scanning it with a beam of electrons.
The electrons interact with the atoms that make up the sample producing signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography, morphology and composition.
Although it is not as powerful as its TEM counterpart, the interactions that take place on the surface of the specimen provide a greater depth of view, higher resolution and more detailed surface picture.
Electron Microscope Image of Organelles.
An electron microscope produced this image of a cell.
The 1980s saw the development of the first scanning probe microscopes.
The first was the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981.
Scanning Probe Microscopy forms images of surfaces using a physical probe that scans the specimen.
The most recent developments in light microscope largely center on the rise of fluorescence microscopy.
A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence and phosphorescence instead of (or sometimes, in addition to) reflection and absorption to study properties of organic or inorganic samples.

KQED:
The World's Most Powerful Microscope
Lawrence Berkeley National labs uses a $27 million electron microscope to make images to a resolution of half the width of a hydrogen atom.
This makes it the world's most powerful microscope.
