If it didn’t, you would go right through it or else it would tip over.
You can watch a video about actions and reactions at this URL:
Newton’s third law of motion states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
This means that forces always act in pairs.
Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, but they are not balanced forces because they act on different objects so they don’t cancel out.
Watch this video about Newton’s third law of motion, and then answer the questions below.

Cody seems a little reluctant to launch himself down this ramp at Newton’s Skate Park.
It will be his first time down the ramp, and he knows from watching his older brother Jerod that he’ll be moving fast by the time he gets to the bottom.
The faster he goes, the harder it will be to stop.
