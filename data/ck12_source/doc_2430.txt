A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportions.
The substances in a mixture do not combine chemically, so they retain their physical properties.
A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout.
A heterogeneous mixture varies in its composition.
Mixtures can be classified on the basis of particle size into three different types: solutions, suspensions, and colloids.
The components of a mixture retain their own physical properties.
These properties can be used to separate the components by filtering, boiling, or other physical processes.

Iron filings are attracted by a magnet.
This is a physical property of iron but not of most other materials, including sand.
How could you use this difference in physical properties to separate a mixture of iron filings and sand?
Define physical change, and give examples of physical change.
Explain how physical changes can be reversed.
These stunning rock arches in Utah were carved by wind-blown sand.
Repeated scouring by the sand wore away the rock, bit by tiny bit, like sandpaper on wood.
