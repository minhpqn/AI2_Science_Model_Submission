Why do some drops fall faster instead of slower when you increase the voltage?
In another universe, where the unit for charge is the “mork,” a physicist performed the Millikan oil drop experiment and measured the following charges on a series of oil drops.
2.62 \times 10^{-13} mork
5.14 \times 10^{-13} mork
3.93 \times 10^{-13} mork
6.55 \times 10^{-13} mork
1.31 \times 10^{-13} mork
Which of the following is the best choice for the charge on an electron in morks?
2.62 \times 10^{-13} mork
6.55 \times 10^{-13} mork
1.31 \times 10^{-13} mork
1.6 \times 10^{-13} mork
None of these.
An oil drop weighs 1.9 \times 10^{-15} \ N and is suspended in an electric field of  6.0 \times 10^3 \ N/C .
What is the charge on the drop?
How many excess electrons does it carry?
Millikan oil drop experiment:
The purpose of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment (1909) was to measure the electric charge of the electron.
He did this by carefully balancing the gravitational and electric forces on tiny charged droplets of oil suspended between parallel charged metal plates.
