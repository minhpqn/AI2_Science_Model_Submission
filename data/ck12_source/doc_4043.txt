If two protist spores are close together, they can fuse to form a diploid zygote.
This is a type of sexual reproduction.
The zygote then undergoes meiosis, producing haploid cells that repeat the cycle.
Spirogyra has a complex life style
Spirogyra is a genus of algae with a complex life cycle.
Each organism consists of rectangular cells connected end-to-end in long filaments.
Protists get food in one of three ways.
They may ingest, absorb, or make their own organic molecules.
Ingestive protists ingest, or engulf, bacteria and other small particles.
They extend their cell wall and cell membrane around the food item, forming a food vacuole .
Then enzymes digest the food in the vacuole.
Absorptive protists absorb food molecules across their cell membranes.
This occurs by diffusion .
These protists are important decomposers.
Photosynthetic protists use light energy to make food.
They are major producers in aquatic ecosystems.
Protists have nuclear membranes around their DNA.
They also have other membrane-bound organelles.
Many protists live in aquatic habitats, and most are motile, or able to move.
Protists have complex life cycles that may include both sexual and asexual reproduction.
