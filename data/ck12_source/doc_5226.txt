Predicting Offspring Phenotypes
You can predict the percents of phenotypes in the offspring of this cross from their genotypes.
B is dominant to b , so offspring with either the BB or Bb genotype will have the purple-flower phenotype.
Only offspring with the bb genotype will have the white-flower phenotype.
Therefore, in this cross, you would expect three out of four (75 percent) of the offspring to have purple flowers and one out of four (25 percent) to have white flowers.
These are the same percents that Mendel obtained in his first experiment.
The Punnett square is visual representation of Mendelian inheritance.
dihybrid cross :
A cross in which the inheritance of two characteristics are tracked at the same time.
monohybrid cross :
A hybridization in which only one characteristic is examined.
Punnett square :
A diagram that helps predict the probable inheritance of alleles in different crosses.
A Punnett square shows all the possible genotypes that can result from a given cross.
It is also used to predict possible phenotypes in offspring.
