All volcanoes share the same basic features.
First, mantle rock melts.
The molten rock collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface.
As the rock heats, it expands.
The hot rock is less dense than the surrounding rock.
The magma rises toward the surface through cracks in the crust.
A volcanic eruption occurs when the magma reaches the surface.
Lava can reach the surface gently or explosively.
An explosive eruption produces huge clouds of volcanic ash.
Chunks of the volcano fly high into the atmosphere.
Explosive eruptions can be tens of thousands of times as powerful as an atomic bomb ( Figure below ).
Hot magma beneath the surface mixes with water.
This forms gases.
The gas pressure grows until it must be released.
The volcano erupts in an enormous explosion.
Eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in 2010
Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland spewed ash into the atmosphere in This was a fairly small eruption, but it disrupted air travel across Europe for six days.
Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky.
The material may form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear explosion.
Hot fragments of rock, called pyroclasts , fly up into the air at very high speeds.
