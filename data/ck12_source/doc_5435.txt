The leucine-zipper (or the basic leucine zipper) domain contains an alpha helix with a leucine at every 7 th amino acid.
If two leucine zipper domains find one another, the leucines can interact like the teeth in a zipper, allowing the dimerization of two proteins.
When binding to the DNA, the leucine residues bind to the sugar-phosphate backbone while the helices sit in the major grooves.
The helix-turn-helix is a major structural motif common in homeobox proteins involved the regulation of development.
It is composed of two alpha helices joined by a short strand of amino acids.
The zinc finger domain consists of a DNA recognition helix and two antiparallel beta sheet structures.
It is stabilized by coordinating zinc ions with regularly spaced zinc-coordinating histidine or cysteine residues.
The Kr√ºppel gap gene (see the Regulation of Gene Expression:
Eukaryotic (Advanced) concept) is a zinc-finger protein.
The helix-loop-helix domain is characterized by two alpha helices connected by a loop, allowing DNA binding.
Specific Transcription Factors
Specific transcription factors are factors that are specific for regulating specific genes.
They are not ubiquitous for all RNA polymerase II associated genes.
Specific factors vary considerably depending on the cis-regulatory sequences associated with the promoter region of a gene.
Examples of specific transcription factors
Heat shock factor
Sp1 = specificity protein 1
AP-1 = activator protein 1
C/EBP = CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein
ATF/CREB = activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding
