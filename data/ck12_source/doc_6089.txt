Why does the pressure drop when you increase the volume?
What defines the pressure of a gas?
Why does an increase in the number of molecules increase the pressure?
Why does an increase in temperature increase the pressure?
rigid container:
One that is incapable of expanding or contracting.
State Boyle’s Law.
Use Boyle’s Law to calculate volume-pressure relationships.
Weather balloons expand and eventually burst as they travel to higher altitudes
How important is it to check the weather?
Each day, hundreds of weather balloons are launched.
Made of a synthetic rubber and carrying a box of instruments, the helium-filled balloon rises up into the sky.
As it gains altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less and the balloon expands.
At some point the balloon bursts due to the expansion, the instruments drop (aided by a parachute) to be retrieved and studied for information about the weather.
Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry.
He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half.
Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant.
An inverse relationship is described in this way.
As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases.
