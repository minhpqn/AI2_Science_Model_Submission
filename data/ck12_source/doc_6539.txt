Acetylene torches are used to weld metal
Better Than A Hacksaw
One of the most effective ways to cut metal is with an oxy-acetylene torch.
Very high temperatures are obtained when acetylene burns in oxygen.
Mixed 1:1 with oxygen, a temperature of over 3000°C can be achieved.
The amount of energy released is high – the net heat of combustion is 1300 kJ/mole.
Safety precautions need to be observed since the gas is very explosive.
For welding and cutting, the oxy-acetylene torch is one of the best ways to go.
Alkenes and Alkynes
An alkene is a hydrocarbon with one or more carbon-carbon double covalent bonds .
The simplest alkene is composed of two carbon atoms and is called ethene (shown below).
Each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms in addition to the double bond between them.
Ethene is the simplest alkene
The hybridization of each carbon atom is sp 2 with trigonal planar geometry.
All the atoms of the molecule lay in one plane.
Like the alkane series, the names of alkenes are based on the number of atoms in the parent chain.
Naming follows the same rules as for alkanes, with the addition of using a number to indicate the location of the double bond.
Propene (C 3 H 6 ) has three carbons total, while butene (C 4 H 8 ) has four.
The general formula for alkenes with one double bond is C n H 2n .
Alkenes are called unsaturated hydrocarbons.
