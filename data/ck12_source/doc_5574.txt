What would you do without a computer?
Over the last few decades, computers have proven to be extremely useful tools for organizing and processing information.  You put data into the computer (such as the structural parameters of a compound) and your output can be a detailed diagram of how that molecule looks in three dimensions.  The computer and its programs transform input data into a useful final product.
