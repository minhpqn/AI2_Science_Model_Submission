Solution:
Because of the law of conservation of momentum, we know that p_{A \text{before}}+p_{B \text{before}}=p_{A \text{after}} + p_{B \text{after}}
m_A v_A+m_B v_B=m_A v{^\prime}_A+m_B v{^\prime}_B
(2.0 \ \text{kg})(2.0 \ \text{m/s})+(4.0 \ \text{kg})(1.0 \ \text{m/s})=(2.0 \ \text{kg})(1.0 \ \text{m/s})+(4.0 \ \text{kg})(v_B{^\prime} \ \text{m/s})
4.0 \ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}+4.0 \ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}=2.0 \ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} + 4v_B{^\prime} \ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
v_B{^\prime}=1.5 \ \text{m/s}
After the collision, ball  B is moving westward at 1.5 m/s.
Example Problem:
A railroad car whose mass is 30,000. kg is traveling with a velocity of 2.2 m/s due east and collides with a second railroad car whose mass is also 30,000. kg and is at rest.
If the two cars stick together after the collision, what is the velocity of the two cars?
Solution:  Note that since the two trains stick together, the final mass is m A +m B , and the final velocity for each object is the same.
Thus the conservation of momentum equation, m_A v_A+m_B v_B=m_A v{^\prime}_A+m_B v{^\prime}_B , can be rewritten m_A v_A+m_B v_B=\left(m_A+m_B\right) v{^\prime}
(30, 000. \ \text{kg})(2.2 \ \text{m/s})+(30, 000. \ \text{kg})(0 \ \text{m/s})=(60, 000. \ \text{kg})(v^\prime \ \text{m/s})
v^\prime=\frac{66000}{60000}=1.1 \ \text{m/s}
After the collision, the two cars move off together toward the east with a velocity of 1.1 m/s.
A closed system is one in which both the object exerting a force and the object receiving the force are inside the system.
In a closed system, momentum is always conserved.
