Q:
Wave amplitude is the maximum distance particles of matter move when a wave passes through them.
Why would amplifying the sound waves as they pass through the middle ear improve hearing?
A:
Amplified sound waves have more energy.
This increases the intensity and loudness of the sounds, so they are easier to hear.
The stirrup in the middle ear passes the amplified sound waves to the inner ear through the oval window.
When the oval window vibrates, it causes the cochlea to vibrate as well.
The cochlea is a shell-like structure that is full of fluid and lined with nerve cells called hair cells.
Each hair cell has many tiny “hairs,” as you can see in the magnified image below .
When the cochlea vibrates, it causes waves in the fluid inside.
The waves bend the “hairs” on the hair cells, and this triggers electrical impulses.
The electrical impulses travel to the brain through nerves.
Only after the nerve impulses reach the brain do we hear the sound.

Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter.
The ear gathers and amplifies sound waves and changes them to electrical signals.
The brain receives the signals and interprets them as the sounds we hear.
The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum.
These structures gather sound waves, funnel them into the ear, and pass the vibrations to the middle ear.
