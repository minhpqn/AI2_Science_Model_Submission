This causes the waves to steepen until they break and fall over, carrying water onto the shore as surf.
At the following URL, read the article about surfing and ocean waves.
Then answer the questions below.
Describe how you can simulate ocean waves in a bathtub,
Why may ocean waves get bigger as they travel farther away from a storm?
Identify three factors that contribute to the formation of good surfing waves.
What is a surface wave?
Describe how particles of the medium move in a surface wave.
Explain how surface waves change when they reach shallow water near shore.
Define wave amplitude.
State how to measure the amplitude of transverse and longitudinal waves.
Explain what determines the amplitude of a wave.
On a windy day, moving air particles strike these flags and transfer their energy of motion to particles of fabric.
The energy travels through the fabric in waves.
You can see the waves rippling through the brightly colored cloth.
The windier the day is, the more vigorously the flags wave.
What’s the Matter?
Waves that travel through matter—such as the fabric of a flag—are called mechanical waves.
The matter they travel through is called the medium.
When the energy of a wave passes through the medium, particles of the medium move.
