Look back at the electromagnet hanging from the crane in the opening photo.
It is useful to turn on its magnetic field so it can pick up the metal car parts.
It is also useful to turn off its magnetic field so it can drop the parts into the train car.
An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material.
The magnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar.
The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar makes an electromagnet very strong.
Electromagnets can be turned on or off and their strength can be changed by controlling the electric current.
Experiment with the electromagnet simulation at the following URL.
Then fill in the blanks in the sentences below.
Increasing the number of loops in the wire coil __________ the strength of the magnetic field.
Decreasing the voltage of the direct current __________ the strength of the magnetic field.
Each time the alternating current changes direction, the magnetic field __________.
When the amplitude of the alternating current is greater, the strength of the magnetic field is __________.
The more quickly the alternating current changes direction, the more quickly the magnetic field __________.
