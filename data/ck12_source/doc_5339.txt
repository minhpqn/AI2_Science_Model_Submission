RNA Structure - Advanced
Describe the structure and function of RNA.
Protein or RNA molecule?
Actually both.
This represents the chemical structure of the ribosome of Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
It is made of both protein and RNA.
The RNA in this ribosome, though, has protein-like properties.
RNAs are able to fold back onto themselves, folding into three-dimensional structures with functional properties.
Sometimes these are enzymatic properties, such as those found in the ribosome.
RNA structure differs from DNA structure in three specific ways.
Both are nucleic acids and made out of nucleotides ; however, RNA is single stranded while DNA is double stranded.
RNA nucleotides, like those from DNA, have three parts: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and a base.
RNA contains the 5-carbon sugar ribose , whereas in DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose.
