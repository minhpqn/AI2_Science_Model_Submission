Partly movable joints allow only a little movement.
Your backbone has partly movable joints between the vertebrae ( Figure below ).
The joints between your vertebrae are only partially movable
The joints between your vertebrae are partially movable.
Movable joints allow the most movement.
Movable joints are also the most common type of joint in your body.
Your fingers, toes, hips, elbows, and knees all provide examples of movable joints.
The surfaces of bones at movable joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage.
The cartilage reduces friction between the bones.
Ligaments often cross a joint, holding two nones together.
For example, there are numerous ligaments connecting the leg bones across the knee joint.
Types of Movable Joints
Four types of movable joints are discussed here.
In a ball-and-socket joint , the ball-shaped surface of one bone fits into the cup-like shape of another.
Examples of a ball-and-socket joint include the hip ( Figure below ) and the shoulder.
Ball and socket joints allow for a wide range of flexibility
Your hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint.
The “ball” end of one bone fits into the “socket” of another bone.
These joints can move in many different directions.
In a hinge joint , the ends of the bones are shaped in a way that allows motion in two directions, forward and backward.
