clone :
A genetically identical copy; may be a gene, a cell or an organism; an organism that is genetically identical to its parent.
DNA ligase :
Enzyme that can attach together (ligates) strands of DNA with double strand breaks.
gel electrophoresis :
An analytical technique used to separate DNA fragments by size and charge; can also be used to separate RNA and proteins.
gene cloning :
The process of isolating a DNA sequence of interest for the purpose of making multiple copies of it.
ligation :
The process of forming a bond to join two nucleotide pairs; joining DNA with double strand breaks.
plasmid :
A small circular piece of DNA that is physically separate from, and can replicate independently of, chromosomal DNA within a cell.
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) :
A repeating series of cycles used to amplify millions of times specific regions of a DNA strand.
recombinant DNA :
