Like most other nonmetals, fluorine cannot conduct electricity, and its electrons explain this as well.
An electric current is a flow of electrons.
Elements that readily give up electrons (the metals) can carry electric current because their electrons can flow freely.
Elements that gain electrons instead of giving them up cannot carry electric current.
They hold onto their electrons so they cannot flow.
Nonmetals are elements that generally cannot conduct electricity.
They are the second largest class of elements after metals.
Examples of nonmetals include hydrogen, carbon, chlorine, and helium.
Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, so many nonmetals are gases.
Nonmetals are also poor conductors of heat, and solid nonmetals are dull and brittle.
Some nonmetals are very reactive, whereas others are not reactive at all.
It depends on the number of electrons in their outer energy level.
Reactive nonmetals tend to gain electrons.
This explains why they cannot conduct electricity, which is a flow of electrons.

The science teacher in the video does an experiment in which he tests the reactivity of four nonmetal gases.
How does he test them?
What is the outcome of the experiment?
Based on this outcome, what conclusion can you draw?
