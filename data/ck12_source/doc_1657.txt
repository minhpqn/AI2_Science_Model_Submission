In a hive, the sexually produced eggs become workers, while the asexually produced eggs become drones.
Diagram of reproduction by binary fission
Bacteria reproduce by binary fission.
Shown is one bacterium reproducing and becoming two bacteria.
During sexual reproduction, two parents are involved.
Most animals are dioecious , meaning there is a separate male and female sex, with the male producing sperm and the female producing eggs.
When a sperm and egg meet during fertilization , a zygote , the first cell of a new organism, is formed ( Figure below ).
This process combines the genetic material from both parents.
The resulting organism will be genetically unique.
The zygote will divide by mitosis and grow into the embryo.
During sexual reproduction, a sperm fertilizes an egg
During sexual reproduction, a sperm fertilizes an egg.
Let's explore how animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually:
Animals often have gonads , organs that produce eggs or sperm.
The male gonads are the testes , and the female gonads are the ovaries .
Testes produce sperm; ovaries produce eggs.
Sperm and egg, the two sex cells, are known as gametes , and can combine two different ways, both of which combine the genetic material from the two parents.
Gametes have half the amount of the genetic material of a regular body cell; they are haploid cells.
In humans, gametes have one set of 23 chromosomes.
Gametes are produced through a special type of cell division known as meiosis .
