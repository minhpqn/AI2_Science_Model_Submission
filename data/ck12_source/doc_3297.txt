When charged particles are close enough to exert force on each other, their electric fields interact.
This is illustrated in the Figure below .
The lines of force bend together when particles with different charges attract each other.
The lines bend apart when particles with like charges repel each other.
At the following URL, play “Electric Field of Dreams” to experience interacting fields of two or more charged particles.
Field lines of two close charges
Note : +q = positive charge and –q = negative charge
Q:
What would the lines of force look like around two negative particles?
A:
They would look like the lines around two positive particles, except the arrows would point toward, rather than away from, the negative particles.
An electric field is a space surrounding a charged particle where the particle exerts electric force.
When charged particles are close enough to exert force on each other, their electric fields interact.
Particles with opposite charges attract each other.
Particles with like charges repel each other.
Play electric field hockey at the following URL until you score at least one goal.
Then write a brief paragraph describing what you did to score a goal.
