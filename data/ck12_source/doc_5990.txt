The formula for ethanol is C 2 H 5 OH.
Write the balanced equation for the combustion of ethanol.
Step 1:
Plan the problem
Ethanol and oxygen are the reactants.
As with a hydrocarbon, the products of the combustion of an alcohol are carbon dioxide and water.
Step 2:
Solve
Write the skeleton equation:
\text{C}_2\text{H}_5 \text{OH}(l)+\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 (g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
Balance the equation.
\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}(l)+3\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{CO}_2(g)+3\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
Step 3:
Think about your result
Combustion reactions must have oxygen as a reactant.
Note that the water that is produced is in the gas rather than the liquid state because of the high temperatures that accompany a combustion reaction.
Combustion reaction is defined and examples are given.
Write the reactions and balance the equations for the questions on the sheet found on this web site:
What is needed for a combustion reaction to take place?
What is formed in any combustion reaction?
