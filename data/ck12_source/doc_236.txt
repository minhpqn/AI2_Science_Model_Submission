Projectile Motion for an Object Launched at an Angle
When an object is projected from rest at an upward angle, its initial velocity can be resolved into two components.
These two components operate independently of each other.
The upward velocity undergoes constant downward acceleration which will result in it rising to a highest point and then falling backward to the ground.
The horizontal motion is constant velocity motion and undergoes no changes due to gravity.The analysis of the motion involves dealing with the two motions independently.
Parabolic path of an object launched at an angle
Example Problem:
A cannon ball is fired with an initial velocity of m/s at an angle of 45° above the horizontal.  What maximum height will it reach and how far will it fly horizontally?
Solution:
The first step in the analysis of this motion is to resolve the initial velocity into its vertical and horizontal components.
v_{\text{i}-\text{up}} = (100. \ \text{m/s})(\sin 45^\circ) = (100. \ \text{m/s})(0.707) = 70.7 \ \text{m/s}
v_{\text{i}-\text{horizontal}} = (100. \ \text{m/s})(\cos 45^\circ) = (100. \ \text{m/s})(0.707) = 70.7 \ \text{m/s}
We will deal with the vertical motion first.
The vertical motion is symmetrical.
As the object rises to its highest point and then falls back down, it will travel the same distance in each direction, and take the same amount of time.
This is often hard to accept, but the amount of time the object takes to come to a stop at its highest point is the same amount of time it takes to return to where it was launched from.
Similarly, the initial velocity upward will be the same magnitude (opposite in direction) as the final velocity when it returns to its original height.
There are several ways we could approach the upward motion.
We could calculate the time it would take gravity to bring the initial velocity to rest.
