Structures of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
Fatty Acids.
Saturated fatty acids have straight chains, like the three fatty acids shown in the upper left.
Unsaturated fatty acids have bent chains, like all the other fatty acids in the figure.
Unsaturated Fatty Acids
In unsaturated fatty acids , some carbon atoms are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
Instead, they are bonded to other groups of atoms.
Wherever carbon binds with these other groups of atoms, it causes chains to bend (see Figure above ).
The bent chains cannot be packed together very tightly, so unsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature.
Plants use unsaturated fatty acids to store energy.
Some examples are shown in Figure below .
Plant products with unsaturated fatty acids
These plant products all contain unsaturated fatty acids.
Types of Lipids
Lipids may consist of fatty acids alone, or they may contain other molecules as well.
For example, some lipids contain alcohol or phosphate groups.
They include
triglycerides: the main form of stored energy in animals.
phospholipids: the major components of cell membranes.
steroids: serve as chemical messengers and have other roles.
