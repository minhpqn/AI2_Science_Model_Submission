One of Pascal’s major contributions is known as Pascal’s law .
This law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid.

A Simple Example
A simple example may help you understand Pascal’s law.
Toothpaste is a fluid that is enclosed in a tube with a small opening at one end.
Look at the toothpaste tube in the Figure below .
When any part of the tube is squeezed, toothpaste squirts out the open end.
The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste.
When the pressure reaches the open end, it forces toothpaste out through the opening.
Pascal's law can be illustrated with a tube of toothpaste
Using Fluid Pressure
The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very useful—besides getting toothpaste out of a tube!
For example, hydraulic brakes in a car use fluid to transmit pressure, and when they do, they also increase force.
You can see how hydraulic brakes work in the Figure below .
Hydraulic brakes utilize Pascal's law
Q :
In this diagram, how can you tell that the force applied by the brake cylinder is greater than the force applied by the brake pedal mechanism?
