Which of the following chemical equations represents a decomposition reaction?
H 2 SO 3 → H 2 O + SO 2
2Na + Cl 2 → 2NaCl
2K + 2H 2 O → 2KOH + H 2

What a job!
The man hanging from the burning helicopter in the photo above is a stunt man.
He fills in for the lead actor in the movie in dangerous scenes like this one.
Like other stunt workers, he has special training to do such dangerous work as safely as possible.
Replacing actors with stunt workers is common in action movies.
Some chemical reactions also involve replacements.
More reactive elements replace less reactive elements in compounds.
