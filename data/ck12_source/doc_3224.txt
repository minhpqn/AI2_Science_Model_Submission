When waves travel through matter, they lose some energy to the matter as they pass through it.
But when waves travel through space, no energy is lost.
Therefore, electromagnetic waves don’t get weaker as they travel.
However, the energy is “diluted” as it travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an ever-larger area.
Electromagnetic Wave Interactions
When electromagnetic waves strike matter, they may interact with it in the same ways that mechanical waves interact with matter.
Electromagnetic waves may:
reflect, or bounce back from a surface;
refract, or bend when entering a new medium;
diffract, or spread out around obstacles.
Electromagnetic waves may also be absorbed by matter and converted to other forms of energy.
Microwaves are a familiar example.
When microwaves strike food in a microwave oven, they are absorbed and converted to thermal energy, which heats the food.
Sources of Electromagnetic Waves
The most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth is the sun.
Electromagnetic waves travel from the sun to Earth across space and provide virtually all the energy that supports life on our planet.
Many other sources of electromagnetic waves depend on technology.
Radio waves, microwaves, and X rays are examples.
We use these electromagnetic waves for communications, cooking, medicine, and many other purposes.
Electromagnetic waves are waves that consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields.
