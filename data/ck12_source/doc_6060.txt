How can we use melting points to assess the purity of a compound?
Define melting point.
What happens when a material melts?
Would you expect ethane (C 2 H 6 ) to have a higher or lower melting point than water?
Explain your answer.
incompressible:
Unable to be compressed.
melting point:
The temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid.
vibrational motion:
Back and forth movement.
Give examples of materials that undergo sublimation.
Sublimation will eventually cause frozen objects to dry
How did the early settlers do their laundry in the winter?
Of course, they could wash the clothes inside, but where to dry them?
There were no dryers available, so the clothes had to be hung up to dry.
In the winter, you would expect that ice would form on the clothes, but that didn’t happen.
Even in freezing weather, the water might freeze initially, but would eventually go off as a vapor – from solid ice directly to the gas stage.
There are still families today who have to rely on this cumbersome process to get their laundry done.
