Like other vectors, a force can be represented with an arrow.
You can see some examples in the Figure below .
The length of each arrow represents the strength of the force, and the way the arrow points represents the direction of the force.
Representation of a force using an arrow
Q :
How could you use arrows to represent the forces that start Coltonâ€™s scooter moving?
A :
Colton pushes against the ground behind him (to the right in the Figure above ).
The ground pushes back with equal force to the left, causing the scooter to move in that direction.
Force arrows A and B in example 2 in the Figure above ) could represent these forces.
Force is defined as a push or pull acting on an object.
Forces include gravity, friction, and applied force.
Force causes changes in the speed or direction of motion.
These changes are called acceleration.
The SI unit for force is the Newton (N).
Force is a vector because it has both size and direction.
Like other vectors, it can be represented by an arrow.
Apply different types of forces to materials in the interactive animated lab at the following URL.
Then answer the questions below.
What is compression, and how does it affect materials?
