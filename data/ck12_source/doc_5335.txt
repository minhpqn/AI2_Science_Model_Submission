DNA helicase :
The enzyme that breaks the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together during DNA replication.
DNA ligase :
Enzyme that can attach together (ligates) strands of DNA with double strand breaks.
DNA polymerase :
The enzyme that builds a new DNA strand during DNA replication.
DNA replication :
The process of copying DNA prior to cell division (eukaryotes) or reproduction (prokaryotes).
lagging strand :
The DNA strand at the opposite side of the replication fork from the leading strand.
leading strand :
The DNA strand that DNA polymerase constructs in the 5' â†’ 3' direction.
Okazaki fragments :
Short fragments of DNA that comprise the lagging strand.
primase :
An enzyme that builds a short RNA primer on the lagging strand during DNA replication.
replication fork :
Site where DNA helices unwinds the DNA, allowing DNA replication to proceed.
semi-conservative :
DNA replication process where half of the parent DNA molecule is conserved in each of the two daughter DNA molecules.
