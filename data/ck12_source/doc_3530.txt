The features unique to plant cells can be seen in Figure below .
Organelles in a plant cell
In addition to containing most of the organelles found in animal cells, plant cells also have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids.
These three features are not found in animal cells.
The Cell Wall
A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell.
The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well.
The cell wall provides structural support and protection.
Pores in the cell wall allow water and nutrients to move into and out of the cell.
The cell wall also prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell.
Microtubules guide the formation of the plant cell wall.
Cellulose is laid down by enzymes to form the primary cell wall.
Some plants also have a secondary cell wall.
The secondary wall contains a lignin, a secondary cell component in plant cells that have completed cell growth/expansion.
The Central Vacuole
Most mature plant cells have a central vacuole that occupies more than 30% of the cell's volume.
The central vacuole can occupy as much as 90% of the volume of certain cells.
The central vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast .
The central vacuole has many functions.
Aside from storage, the main role of the vacuole is to maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall.
