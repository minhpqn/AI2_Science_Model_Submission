Q :
Why is it harder to start and stop the skateboard than it is to keep it rolling?
A :
The reason is inertia.
What Is Inertia?
Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion.
All objects have inertia, whether they are stationary or moving.
Inertia explains Newton’s first law of motion, which states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.
That’s why Newton’s first law of motion is sometimes called the law of inertia.

Q :
You probably don’t realize it, but you experience inertia all the time, and you don’t have to ride a skateboard.
For example, think about what happens when you are riding in a car that stops suddenly.
Your body moves forward on the seat and strains against the seat belt.
Why does this happen?
A :
The brakes stop the car but not your body, so your body keeps moving forward because of inertia.
Wearing a seat belt is important because of inertia
Inertia explains why it’s important to always wear a seat belt.
