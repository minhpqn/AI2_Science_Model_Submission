Marine biomes have more salt and are characteristic of the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries.
Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of temperature or moisture.
Instead, their main limiting factors are the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water.
Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes.
Organisms that live in marine biomes must be adapted to the salt in the water.
For example, many have organs for excreting excess salt.
Marine biomes include the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries ( Figure below ).
The oceans are the largest of all the ecosystems.
They can be divided into four separate zones based on the amount of sunlight.
Ocean zones are also divided based on their depth and their distance from land.
Each zone has a great diversity of species.
Within a coral reef , the dominant organisms are corals.
Corals consist partially of algae, which provide nutrients via photosynthesis.
Corals also extend tentacles to obtain plankton from the water.
Coral reefs include several species of microorganisms, invertebrates, fishes, sea urchins, octopuses, and sea stars.
Estuaries are areas where freshwater streams or rivers merge with the ocean.

Freshwater biomes are defined by their low salt concentration, usually less than 1%.
Plants and animals in freshwater regions are adjusted to the low salt content and would not be able to survive in areas of high salt concentration, such as the ocean.
