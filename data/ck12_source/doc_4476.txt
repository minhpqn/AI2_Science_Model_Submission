In fact, you are constantly making new bone tissue.
That means that you are also constantly getting rid of bone.
Bone is full of blood and nerves and all sorts of cells and proteins, making it an extremely complex living tissue.
Structure of Bones
Many people think of bones as being dead, dry, and brittle.
These adjectives correctly describe the bones of a preserved skeleton, but the bones in a living human being are very much alive.
As shown in Figure below , the basic structure of bones is bone matrix , which makes up the underlying rigid framework of bones, composed of both compact bone and spongy bone.
The bone matrix consists of tough protein fibers, mainly collagen , that become hard and rigid due to mineralization with calcium crystals.
Bone matrix is crisscrossed by blood vessels and nerves and also contains specialized bone cells that are actively involved in metabolic processes.

Bone matrix provides bones with their basic structure.
Notice the spongy bone in the middle, and the compact bone towards the outer region.
The osteon is the functional unit of compact bone.
There are three types of specialized cells in human bones: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts.
These cells are responsible for bone growth and mineral homeostasis.
Osteoblasts make new bone cells and secrete collagen that mineralizes to become bone matrix.
They are responsible for bone growth and the uptake of minerals from the blood.
Osteocytes regulate mineral homeostasis.
