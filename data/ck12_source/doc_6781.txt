Energy is conserved.
Thus one can get a large force for a small distance equal to a small force for a large distance.
Mechanical advantage equals the distance of effort divided by the distance the object moves.
It is also equal to the output force divided by the input force.
You need to push a 500 kg grand piano onto a stage that is 3 m above the ground.
If you can only apply a maximum force of 1000 N, what is the minimum distance from the stage that you should begin building your ramp?
We should start this problem by determining the mechanical advantage required to move the piano based on the weight of the piano and the force you can apply.
We'll define F_{out} to be the force it would take to lift the piano straight up and F_{in} to be the force you can apply.
MA&=\frac{F_{out}}{F_{in}}\\\MA&=\frac{500\;\text{kg} * 9.8\;\text{m/s}^2}{1000\;\text{N}}\\\MA&=\frac{4900\;\text{N}}{1000\;\text{N}}\\\MA&=4.9\\\
Now we can use this to find how long the ramp needs to be.
Now we can just use the Pythagorean theorem to determine how far away from the stage the ramp should start.
