How much current is supplied to the resistance?
How many joules of energy is provided by the heater in 10.0 s?
I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{120.0 \ V}{25.0 \ \Omega}=4.8 \ A
E = I^2Rt = (4.8 \ A)^2(25.0 \ \Omega)(10.0 \ s) = 5760 \ \text{joules}
Think again about the power grid.
When electricity is transmitted over long distances, some amount of energy is lost in overcoming the resistance in the transmission lines.
We know the equation for the power dissipated is given by P = I^2R .
The energy loss can be minimized by choosing the material with the least resistance for power lines, but changing the current also has significant effects.
Consider a reduction of the current by a power of ten:
How much power is dissipated when a current of 10.0 A passes through a power line whose resistance is 1.00 Ω?
P = I^2R = (10.0 \ A)^2(1.00 \ \Omega) = 100. \ \text{Watts}
How much power is dissipated when a current of 1.00 A passes through a power line whose resistance is 1.00 Ω?
P = I^2R = (1.00 \ A)^2(1.00 \ \Omega) = 1.00 \ \text{Watts}
The power loss is reduced tremendously by reducing the magnitude of the current through the resistance.
Power companies must transmit the same amount of energy over the power lines but keep the power loss minimal.
They do this by reducing the current.
From the equation P = VI , we know that the voltage must be increased to keep the same power level.
Even though the companies that supply electrical energy are often called “power” companies, they are actually selling energy.
Your electricity bill is based on energy, not power.
The amount of energy provided by electric current can be calculated by multiplying the watts (J/s) by seconds to yield joules.
