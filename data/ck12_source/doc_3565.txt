The grana consist of sac-like membranes, known as thylakoid membranes.
These membranes contain photosystems , which are groups of molecules that include chlorophyll , a green pigment.
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes.
The stroma is the space outside the thylakoid membranes, as shown in Figure below .
This is where the reactions of the Calvin cycle take place.
In addition to enzymes, two basic types of molecules - pigments and electron carriers – are key players in this process and are also found in the thylakoid membranes.
You can take a video tour of a chloroplast at Encyclopedia Britannica:
Chloroplast :
The interior of a chloroplast, showing chlorophyll
A chloroplast consists of thylakoid membranes surrounded by stroma.
The thylakoid membranes contain molecules of the green pigment chlorophyll.
Electron carrier molecules are usually arranged in electron transport chains (ETCs).
These accept and pass along energy-carrying electrons in small steps ( Figure below ).
In this way, they produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical energy.
Electrons in transport chains behave much like a ball bouncing down a set of stairs – a little energy is lost with each bounce.
However, the energy “lost” at each step in an electron transport chain accomplishes a little bit of work, which eventually results in the synthesis of ATP.
The light reactions of photosynthesis
This figure shows the light reactions of photosynthesis.
This stage of photosynthesis begins with photosystem II (so named because it was discovered after photosystem I).
Find the two electrons (2 e - ) in photosystem II, and then follow them through the electron transport chain (also called the electron transfer chain) to the formation of NADPH.
