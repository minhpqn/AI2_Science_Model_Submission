What is its angular velocity after collapse?
A merry-go-round consists of a uniform solid disc of 225 \;\mathrm{kg} and a radius of 6.0 \;\mathrm{m} .
A single 80 \;\mathrm{kg} person stands on the edge when it is coasting at 0.20 revolutions per sec.
How fast would the device be rotating after the person has walked 3.5 \;\mathrm{m} toward the center. (The moments of inertia of compound objects add.)

The lessons here cover rotational motion, including important problem solving techniques.
