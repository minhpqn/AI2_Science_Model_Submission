Ouch, that hurts!
Bees are beautiful creatures that help plants flourish.
They carry pollen from one plant to another to facilitate plant growth and development.
But, they can also be troublesome when they sting you.
For people who are allergic to bee venom, this can be a serious, life-threatening problem.
For the rest of us, it can be a painful experience.
When stung by a bee, one first-aid treatment is to apply a paste of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to the stung area.
This weak base helps with the itching and swelling that accompanies the bee sting.
Calculating pH of Weak Acid and Base Solutions
The  K_a and  K_b values have been determined for a great many acids and bases, as shown in Tables 21.5 and 21.6.
These can be used to calculate the pH of any solution of a weak acid or base whose ionization constant is known.
Sample Problem:
Calculating the pH of a Weak Acid
Calculate the pH of a 2.00 M solution of nitrous acid (HNO 2 ).
The K_a for nitrous acid is 4.5 Ã— 10 -4 .
Step 1:
List the known values and plan the problem.
initial [HNO 2 ] = 2.00 M
K_a=4.5 \times 10^{-4}
pH = ?
