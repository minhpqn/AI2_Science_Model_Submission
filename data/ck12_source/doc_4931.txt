However, biofilms are not considered a multicellular organism, but this and other colonial organisms were probably the first step toward the evolution of multicellular organisms.
Colonial algae of the genus ''Volvox''
Colonial algae of the genus Volvox .
A colony of single-cell organisms is known as colonial organisms .
The difference between a multicellular organism and a colonial organism is that the individual organisms that form a colony or biofilm can, if separated, survive on their own, while cells from a multicellular organism (e.g., liver cells) cannot.
Colonial organisms were probably one of the first evolutionary steps towards multicellular organisms.
Algae of the genus Volvox are an example of the bridge between colonial organisms and multicellular organisms.
Each Volvox , shown in Figure above , is a colonial organism.
It is made of up to 50,000 photosynthetic flagellate algae that are grouped together into a hollow sphere.
Volvox live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700.
The Volvox sphere has a distinct front and back end.
The colony of cells can swim in a coordinated fashion.
The cells have eyespots, which are more developed in the cells near the front.
This enables the colony to swim towards light.
Origin of Multicellularity
The oldest known multicellular organism is a red algae Bangiomorpha pubescens , fossils of which were found in 1.2 billion year old rock.
However, the first organisms were single celled.
How multicellular organisms developed is the subject of much debate.
Scientists think that multicellularity arose from cooperation between many organisms of the same species.
The Colonial Theory proposes that this cooperation led to the development of a multicellular organism.
