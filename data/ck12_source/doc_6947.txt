where q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, B is the magnetic field value and  \theta  is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector.
Note that for problems where the direction of the particle and the direction of the magnetic field are perpendicular then
F_B = qvB
also, recall that
F = qE
E = V \Delta x && \text{ for a constant electric field}
As moving charges create magnetic fields, so they experience forces from magnetic fields generated by other materials.
The magnitude of the force experienced by a particle traveling in a magnetic field depends on the charge of the particle  (q)  , the velocity of the particle  (v)  , the strength of the field (B)  , and, importantly, the angle between their relative directions  (\theta) :
There is a second right hand rule that will show the direction of the force on a positive charge in a magnetic field: point your index finger along the direction of the particleâ€™s velocity .
If your middle finger points along the magnetic field, your thumb will point in the direction of the force.
NOTE:
For negative charge reverse the direction of the force (or use your left hand)
For instance, if a positively charged particle is moving to the right, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going out of the page, while if a positively charged particle is moving to the left, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going into the page:

Find the Magnetic Field
Question :
An electron is moving to the east at a speed of 1.8\times10^6\;\mathrm{m/s} .
It feels a force in the upward direction with a magnitude of 2.2\times10^{-12}\;\mathrm{N} .
What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field this electron just passed through?
