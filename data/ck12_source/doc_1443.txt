Under some conditions, a glacier will move extremely fast.
Under other conditions, the glacier may not move and will become an ice sheet.
Because the ice is moving, glaciers have cracks called crevasses ( Figure below ).
There is a large crevasse at the top of an alpine glacier called a bergshrund .
Below the bergshrund, the ice is moving downhill.
Above the bergshrund, the ice is stuck to the mountain.
Crevasses in a glacier are the result of movement
Crevasses in a glacier are the result of movement.
Glaciers are melting back in many locations around the world.
When a glacier no longer moves, it is called an ice sheet.
This usually happens when it is less than 0.1 km2 in area and 50 m thick.
In Glacier National Park ( Figure below ), many glaciers have become ice sheets.
In 1850, the park had 150 glaciers.
There are only about 25 today.
The reason that there is so much melting is that summer temperatures have risen.
Scientists estimate that the park will have no active glaciers as early as 2020.
Satellite image of Glacier National Park, and its shrinking glaciers
This satellite image shows Grinnell Glacier, Swiftcurrent Glacier, and Gem Glacier in 2003.
The outlines show the extent of the glaciers in Gem Glacier is only 0.020 km 2 (5 acres) in area.
This makes it about one-fifth the size of the smallest active glaciers.
