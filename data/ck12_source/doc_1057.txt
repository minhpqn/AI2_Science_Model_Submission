Death Valley, the driest spot in the United States, is found there.
Mt.
Shasta, at the north end of the Sierra Nevada, is the southernmost remaining volcanic cone in the Cascades Range.
East of the image of California is Nevada.
Very different from California, Nevada is extremely arid.
The Basin and Range province consists of a set of mountains and valleys.
You can see the ranges as dark brown rocky regions and the valleys as lighter brown.
Map of major geographic features of the Pacific Northwest
North of California along the Pacific Coast is Oregon, Washington, and then British Columbia in Canada.
This region is similar to California in having a coastal range, a central valley (at least in part of Oregon), and very arid lands east of the high Cascades mountains.
The Cascades are a chain of volcanoes that run through Oregon and Washington, and into British Columbia ( Figure above ).
Some of them are easily spotted on this image as white spots in the midst of the green forests of the Cascades Range.
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming
Map of major geographic features of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming
This image shows the states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

Arid lands lie to the east.
The states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming are located east of the Pacific Northwest.
The landscape ranges from mountainous forests to deserts ( Figure above ).
