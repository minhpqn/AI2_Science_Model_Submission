Plant Reproduction and Life Cycle
Define alternation of generations.
Outline plantsâ€™ reproductive cycle.
Distinguish a sporophyte from a gametophyte.
Do all plants have flowers?
No, plants do not all have flowers.
For example, the mosses and ferns pictured here are both types of plants.
However, they never produce flowers.
They don't produce seeds, either.
They do, however, make tiny spores to reproduce.
Plant Reproduction and Life Cycle
The life cycle of a plant is very different from the life cycle of an animal.
Humans are made entirely of diploid cells (cells with two sets of chromosomes, referred to as ''2n'').
Our only cells that are haploid cells (cells with one set of chromosomes, ''n'') are sperm and egg cells.
