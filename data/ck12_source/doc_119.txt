How do birds reproduce?
We know that chickens lay eggs.
But how do they do that?
It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate.
In birds, this will involve a type of display, usually performed by the male.
Some displays are very elaborate and may include dancing, aerial flights, or wing or tail drumming.
Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females.
If they are successful at attracting a female, it will lead to breeding.
Birds reproduce by internal fertilization , during which the egg is fertilized inside the female.
Like reptiles, birds have cloaca , or a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste.
The male brings his sperm to the female cloaca.
The sperm fertilizes the egg.
Then the hard-shelled egg develops within the female.
The hard-shelled eggs have a fluid-filled amnion , a thin membrane forming a closed sac around the embryo.
Eggs are usually laid in a nest.
Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors?
Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs ( Figure below ).
This gives the eggs protection against predation.
Some species, like ground-nesting nightjars, have pale eggs, but the birds camouflage the eggs with their feathers.
To protect their young, different species of birds make different nests.
