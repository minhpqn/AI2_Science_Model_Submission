To get a better feel for projectile motion, try these interactive animations:
(Click on the applet “Cannon.”)
Projectile motion is movement of an object in a curved path toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and the downward force of gravity acting on it.
Examples of objects that have projectile motion include arrows and cannon balls.
Play the game at the following URL by shooting the cannon at a stationary target.
Experiment with three variables—cannon power, height of barrel, and angle of barrel—until you find at least three different combinations of variables that allow the cannon ball to hit the target.
Record the values for the three combinations of variables.
Then summarize what you learned by doing the activity.
What is projectile motion?
When does it occur?
How might knowledge of projectile motion help you shoot baskets in basketball?
Define orbital motion and explain why it occurs.
Describe the orbits of Earth around the sun and the moon around Earth.
As you can see in this NASA photo, Earth is tiny compared with the massive sun.
The sun’s gravity is relatively strong because the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to their masses.
Gravity between the sun and Earth pulls Earth toward the sun, but Earth never falls into the sun.
Instead, it constantly revolves around the sun, making one complete revolution every 365 days.
Q :
Why doesn’t the sun’s gravity pull Earth down to the surface of the sun?
