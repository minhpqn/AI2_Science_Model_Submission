The thermal energy, or heat, of an object is obtained by adding up the kinetic energy of all the molecules within it.
Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the molecules.
Absolute zero is the temperature where molecular motion stops and is the lowest possible temperature.
Zero on the Celsius scale is the freezing point of water and 100째C is the boiling point of water.
The relationship between Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales is given by K = 째C + 273.15.
The following video demonstrates how some materials conduct heat better than others.

If you had beeswax attached to one end of a metal skewer and you placed the other end of the skewer in a flame, what would happen after a few minutes?
Which contains more heat, a coffee cup of boiling water or a bathtub of room temperature water?
thermal energy:
The total energy of a substance particles due to their translational movement or vibrations.
heat: energy transferred from one body to another by thermal interactions.
