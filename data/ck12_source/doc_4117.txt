The two groups hunt different prey species, eat different foods, sing different songs, and have different social interactions ( Figure below ).
Two groups of Gal√°pagos Island finch species lived in the same space, but each had his or her own distinct mating signals.
Members of each group selected mates according to different beak structures and bird calls.
The behavioral differences kept the groups separated until they formed different species.
Two groups of orcas may live in the same part of the Pacific Ocean, but do not mate
Scientists suspect that two types of orca whales live in the same part of the Pacific Ocean for part of the year, but they do not mate.
Speciation, the creation of a new species, can happen through natural selection or artificial selection.
Reproductive isolation is necessary for speciation to occur, and this can happen through a geographic barrier (allopatric speciation) or without a geographic barrier (sympatric speciation).
Different behaviors can result in sympatric speciation.
