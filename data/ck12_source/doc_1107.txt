This is shown as paths (A) and (B).
If the cannonball is launched at a fast speed, Earth curves away at the same rate that the cannonball falls.
The cannonball then goes into a circular orbit, as in path (C).
If the cannonball is launched even faster, it could go into an elliptical orbit (D).
It might even leave Earth’s gravity and go into space (E).
Isaac Newton cannonball orbit
Isaac Newton explained how a cannonball fired from a high point with enough speed could orbit Earth.
Unfortunately, Newton’s idea would not work in real life.
A cannonball launched at a fast speed from Mt.
Everest would burn up in the atmosphere.
However, a rocket can launch straight up, then steer into orbit.
It won't burn up in the atmosphere.
So a rocket can carry a satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into orbit.
Satellites have different views depending on their orbit.
Satellites may be put in a low orbit.
These satellites orbit from north to south over the poles.
These satellites view a different part of Earth each time they circle.
Imaging and weather satellites need this type of view.
Satellites may be placed so that they orbit at the same rate the Earth spins.
The satellite then remains over the same location on the surface.
