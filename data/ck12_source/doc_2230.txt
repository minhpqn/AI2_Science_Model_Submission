There are currently five dwarf planets in our solar system:
Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres.
Most dwarf planets are similar to planets, except that they haven't cleared their space of debris.
Pluto was thought to be larger than it is because its large moon made the dwarf planet look bigger than it is.
