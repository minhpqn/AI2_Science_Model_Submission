Why is DNA analysis the most important tool of the forensic scientist?
Describe forensic STR analysis.
What's a fingerprint made of DNA?
DNA fingerprinting creates a pattern based on an individual's unique DNA.
This can be used as an unique identifier for a person.
As you can imagine, this would be a key tool of the forensic scientist.
Applications of DNA Technology:
Forensic DNA Analysis
You know that DNA can be used to distinguish individuals from each other.
You may have heard that DNA can also be used to match evidence and suspects and help solve crimes.
This is demonstrated on shows like CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation .
But how is this done?
How is a genetic fingerprint , or a DNA fingerprint , which is a DNA pattern unique to each individual (except identical twins), created?
Genetic fingerprinting, or DNA fingerprinting, distinguishes between individuals of the same species using only samples of their DNA.
DNA fingerprinting has thus become one of the most powerful tools of the forensic scientist, enabling law enforcement personnel to match biological evidence from crime scenes to suspects.
As any two humans have the majority of their DNA sequence in common, those sequences which demonstrate high variability must be analyzed.
This DNA analysis was first developed using DNA hybridization techniques, but now is almost exclusively PCR-based.
DNA fingerprinting was developed by Sir Alec Jeffreys in 1985.
Genetic fingerprinting exploits highly variable repeating sequences.
