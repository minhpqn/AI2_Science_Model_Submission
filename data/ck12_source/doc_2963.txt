Q:
Jerod is riding his bike at a constant speed.
As he rides down his street he is moving from east to west.
At the end of the block, he turns right and starts moving from south to north, but he’s still traveling at the same speed.
Has his velocity changed?
A:
Although Jerod’s speed hasn’t changed, his velocity has changed because he is moving in a different direction.
Q:
How could you use vector arrows to represent Jerod’s velocity and how it changes?
A:
The arrows might look like this:
Calculating Average Velocity
You can calculate the average velocity of a moving object that is not changing direction by dividing the distance the object travels by the time it takes to travel that distance.
You would use this formula:
This is the same formula that is used for calculating average speed.
It represents velocity only if the answer also includes the direction that the object is traveling.
Let’s work through a sample problem.
Toni’s dog is racing down the sidewalk toward the east.
The dog travels 36 meters in 18 seconds before it stops running.
The velocity of the dog is:
