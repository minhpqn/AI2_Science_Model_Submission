They form the walls of internal organs such as the heart and stomach.
You can flex your biceps like a body builder, but you cannot control the muscles inside you.
Itâ€™s a good thing that they work on their own without any conscious effort on your part, because movement of these muscles is essential for survival.
What Are Muscles?
The muscular system consists of all the muscles of the body.
Muscles are organs composed mainly of muscle cells, which are also called muscle fibers .
Each muscle fiber is a very long, thin cell that can do something no other cell can do.
It can contract, or shorten.
Muscle contractions are responsible for virtually all the movements of the body, both inside and out.
There are three types of muscle tissues in the human body: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues.
They are shown in Figure below and described below.
You can also watch an overview of the three types at this link:

Types of muscle tissue
Types of Muscle Tissue.
Both skeletal and cardiac muscles appear striated, or striped, because their cells are arranged in bundles.
Smooth muscles are not striated because their cells are arranged in sheets instead of bundles.
Muscle tissue in the walls of internal organs such as the stomach and intestines is smooth muscle .
When smooth muscle contracts, it helps the organs carry out their functions.
For example, when smooth muscle in the stomach contracts, it squeezes the food inside the stomach, which helps break the food into smaller pieces.
