What happens next depends on the core's mass.
The core might be less than about four times the mass of the sun.
In this case, the star will become a neutron star.
A neutron star ( Figure below ) is made almost entirely of neutrons.
A neutron star has more mass than the sun; yet, it is only a few kilometers in diameter.

A pulsar is a rotating neutron star that emits radiation in pulses.
A pulsar can only be seen when the beam is pointing toward Earth.
Pictured below is a nebular that looks like a cosmic hand ( Figure below ).
There is a bright swirl of gas in the wrist of the hand.
A very tiny but bright neutron star is in the center of that swirl.

The core remaining after a supernova could be more than about five times the mass of the sun.
In this case, the core collapses to become a black hole .
Black holes are unimaginably dense.
Not even light can escape their gravity ( Figure below )!
This is why they are black.
