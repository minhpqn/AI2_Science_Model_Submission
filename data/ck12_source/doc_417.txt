List blood types in humans.
Describe how blood type is determined.
Explain universal donors and universal recipients.
What's your type?
As this woman donates blood, you can see her blood collecting in a special bag.
This bag is coded with her blood type.
That makes it possible for doctors and nurses to match up the blood she is giving to a recipient that has the same blood type.
Do you know what your blood type is?
Maybe you have heard people say that they have type A or type O blood.
Blood type is a way to describe the type of antigens , or proteins, on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).
There are four blood types;
A, B, AB, and O.
Type A blood has type A antigens on the RBCs in the blood.
Type AB blood has A and B antigens on the RBCs.
Type B has B antigens on the RBCs.
Type O does not have either A or B antigens.
The ABO blood group system is important if a person needs a blood transfusion.
A blood transfusion is the process of putting blood or blood products from one person into the circulatory system of another person.
The blood type of the recipient needs to be carefully matched to the blood type of the donor.
That's because different blood types have different types of antibodies, or proteins, released by the blood cells.
