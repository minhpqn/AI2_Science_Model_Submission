That force is friction between the skateboard and the pavement.
The force of friction is unbalanced because Nina is no longer pushing with her foot to keep the skateboard moving.
That’s why the skateboard stops.
Skateboarder changing direction
Corey’s friend Jerod likes to skate on the flat banks at Newton’s Skate Park.
That’s Jerod in the Figure above .
As he reaches the top of a bank, he turns his skateboard to go back down.
To change direction, he presses down with his heels on one edge of the skateboard.
This causes the skateboard to turn in the opposite direction.
Can you turn a skateboard like Jerod?

Q :
How does Jerod use Newton’s first law of motion to change the direction of his skateboard?
A :
Pressing down on just one side of a skateboard creates an unbalanced force.
The unbalanced force causes the skateboard to turn toward the other side.
In the picture, Jerod is pressing down with his heels, so the skateboard turns toward his toes.
Newton’s first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.
