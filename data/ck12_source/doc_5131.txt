Asexual reproduction in prokaryotic organisms; produces two identical cells.
division septum :
The cell wall that forms between daughter cells at the end of mitosis in plant cells or just before separation in bacteria.
prokaryotic :
From a single-celled organism that lacks a nucleus; prokaryote.
prokaryotic cell :
Typical of simple, single-celled organisms, such as bacteria; lack a nucleus and other membrane bound organelles.
Binary fission is a form of cell division in prokaryotic organisms that produces identical offspring.
What is asexual reproduction?
What is binary fission?
Describe the process of prokaryotic cell division.
What is division septum?
Eukaryotic Cell Division - Advanced
Describe cell division in eukaryotes.
Explain the main differences between cell division in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
Are these cells prokaryotic or eukaryotic?
Notice the nucleus.
Eukaryotic cell division is more complicated than prokaryotic division because of this organelle.
Having more than one chromosome and ensuring that all daughter cells receive a full compliment of chromosomes is no easy task.
