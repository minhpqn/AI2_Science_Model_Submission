He proposed that all cells arise only from other cells.
The collective observations of all three scientists form the Cell Theory, which states that:
all organisms are made up of one or more cells,
all the life functions of an organism occur within cells,
all cells come from preexisting cells.
Cells with different functions often have different shapes.
The cells pictured in Figure below are just a few examples of the many different shapes that cells may have.
Each type of cell in the figure has a shape that helps it do its job.
For example, the job of the nerve cell is to carry messages to other cells.
The nerve cell has many long extensions that reach out in all directions, allowing it to pass messages to many other cells at once.
Do you see the tail-like projections on the algae cells?
Algae live in water, and their tails help them swim.
Pollen grains have spikes that help them stick to insects such as bees.
How do you think the spikes help the pollen grains do their job? ( Hint:
Insects pollinate flowers.)
Pictures of various cell types illustrating cell diversity
As these pictures show, cells come in many different shapes.
How are the shapes of these cells related to their functions?
Four Common Parts of a Cell
Although cells are diverse, all cells have certain parts in common.
