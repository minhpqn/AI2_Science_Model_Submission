The atomic number will decrease by one while the atomic weight does not change.
A positron is often designated by Î² + .
Carbon-11 emits a positron to become boron-11:
{^{11}_{\phantom{0}6}\text{C}} \rightarrow {^{11}_{\phantom{0}5}\text{B}} + {^{\phantom{+}0}_{+1} \beta}
Radioactive decay processes are described.
