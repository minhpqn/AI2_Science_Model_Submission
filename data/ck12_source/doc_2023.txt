Coral reefs are very beautiful and very diverse.
Reefs can form interesting shapes in the oceans.
Remember that there are many volcanoes in the ocean.
Coral reefs can form on volcanoes in tropical water.
Since the volcanoes are cones, the reef forms in a circle around the volcano.
Eventually the volcano becomes inactive.
The mountain subsides and erodes so that it is below sea level.
This leaves a circular coral reef ( Figure below ).
The remnants of a volcano are surrounded by the circular reef
In this image of Maupiti Island in the South Pacific, the remnants of the volcano are surrounded by the circular reef.
Eventually, all that is left is a reef island called an atoll .
A lagoon is found inside the reef.
The open ocean is a vast area.
Food washes down from the land.
Food is also created by photosynthesizing plankton.
Zooplankton and larger animals feed on the phytoplankton and on each other.
Larger animals such as whales and giant groupers may live their entire lives in the open water.
In the deepest ocean, survival is almost impossible ( Figure below ).
Itâ€™s very rare to find a meal, so the fish there use very little energy.
They are very small.
