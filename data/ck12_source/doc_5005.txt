Substance that forms as a result of a chemical reaction.
reactant :
Substance involved in a chemical reaction that is present at the beginning of the reaction.
All chemical reactions require activation energy, which is the energy needed to get a reaction started.
Rates of chemical reactions depend on factors such as the concentration of reactants and the temperature at which reactions occur.
Both factors affect the ability of reactant molecules to react.
