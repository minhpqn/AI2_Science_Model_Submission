The outer layer is tough and waterproof.
It is very difficult for pathogens to get through this layer of skin.
The skin's many layers helps keep most pathogens out
This drawing shows that the skin has many layers.
The outer layer is so tough that it keeps out most pathogens.
The mouth and nose are not lined with skin.
Instead, they are lined with mucous membranes .
Other organs that are exposed to the outside world, including the lungs and stomach, are also lined with mucous membranes.
Mucous membranes are not tough like skin, but they have other defenses.
One defense of mucous membranes is the mucus they release.
Mucus is a sticky, moist substance that covers mucous membranes.
Most pathogens get stuck in the mucus before they can do harm to the body.
Many mucous membranes also have cilia.
Cilia in the lungs are pictured below ( Figure below ).
Cilia are tiny finger-like projections.
They move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings.
When you clear your throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body.
Cilia lining the lungs help sweep mucus and pathogens out of the lungs
This is what the cilia lining the lungs look like when they are magnified.
Their movements constantly sweep mucus and pathogens out of the lungs.
