Two of the most common vision problems are nearsightedness and farsightedness.
Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects appear blurry.
The eyeball is longer than normal, focusing images front of the retina.
Concave lenses can correct the problem.
Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry.
The eyeball is shorter than normal, focusing images behind the retina.
Convex lenses can correct the problem.

Electric Charge and Electric Force
Define electric charge.
Describe electric forces between charged particles.
A lightning bolt is like the spark that gives you a shock when you touch a metal doorknob.
Of course, the lightning bolt is on a much larger scale.
But both the lightning bolt and spark are a sudden transfer of electric charge.
Introducing Electric Charge
Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching.
All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms.
