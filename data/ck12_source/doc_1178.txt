Diamonds and graphite are both made from carbon
Diamonds (A) and graphite (B) are both made of only carbon, but they're not much alike.
The patterns of atoms affect a mineral's physical properties.
A mineral's crystal shape is determined by the way the atoms are arranged.
For example, you can see how atoms are arranged in halite ( Figure below ).
Below, you can see how salt crystals look under a microscope ( Figure below ).
Salt crystals are all cubes whether they're small or large.
Salt crystals are cubic in shape
Under a microscope, salt crystals are cubes.
In this crystal, the corners have worn away.
Physical properties help scientists identify different minerals; this is explored in the concept "Mineral Identification."
A mineral is an inorganic, crystalline solid.
A mineral forms through natural processes.
It has a definite chemical composition.
Minerals can be identified by their characteristic physical properties.
They include crystalline structure, hardness, density, breakage, and color.
