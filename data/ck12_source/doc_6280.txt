Molar Heat of Combustion
Many chemical reactions are combustion reactions.  It is often important to know the energy produced in such a reaction so we can determine which fuel might be the most efficient for a given purpose.
The molar heat of combustion (He)  is the heat released when one mole of a substance is completely burned.
Typical combustion reactions involve the reaction of a carbon-containing material with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water as products.  If methanol is burned in air, we have:
\text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \quad \text{He}= 890 \text{ kJ/mol}
In this case, one mole of oxygen reacts with one mole of methanol to form one mole of carbon dioxide and two moles of water.
It should be noted that inorganic substances can also undergo a form of combustion reaction:
2\text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \ \text{Mg}
In this case there is no water and no carbon dioxide formed.  These reactions are generally not what we would be talking about when we discuss combustion reactions.

Calculation of Heat of Combustion
Heats of combustion are usually determined by burning a known amount of the material in a bomb calorimeter with an excess of oxygen.  By measuring  the temperature change, the heat of combustion can be determined.
A 1.75 gram sample of ethanol is burned and produced a temperature increase of 55°C in 200 grams of water.  Calculate the molar heat of combustion.
Step 1:  List the known quantities and plan the problem.
mass of ethanol = 1.55 grams
molar mass of ethanol = 46.1 g/mol
mass of water = 200 grams
c_{p} \ \text{water}: 4.18 \text{ J/g}^\circ \text{C}
temperature increase = 55°C
