Molecular Biology - Advanced
What molecule determines many of your traits?
Biology of the Molecule.
This concept focuses on DNA and proteins, and specifically how the "instructions" in DNA are used to make proteins.
This model depicts a protein binding to DNA.
Notice the "spiral staircase" shape of the DNA molecule, with the globular wrapped protein around it.
DNA - Advanced
Describe the role of DNA.
What large organic molecule has a spiral shape, and may be the most important molecule to life?
Here’s a hint: molecules like this one determine who you are.
They contain genetic information that controls your characteristics.
They determine your eye color, facial features, and other physical attributes.
What molecule is it?
You probably answered “DNA.” Today, it is commonly known that DNA is the genetic material.
For a long time, scientists knew such molecules existed.
They were aware that genetic information was contained within organic molecules.
However, they didn’t know which type of molecules play this role.
In fact, for many decades, scientists thought that proteins were the molecules that carry genetic information.
In these concepts, you will learn how scientists discovered that DNA carries the code of life.
