Freezing point is a physical property of matter.
The freezing point of pure water is 0째C.
Below this temperature, water exists as ice.
Above this temperature, it exists as liquid water or water vapor.
Many other substances have much lower or higher freezing points than water.
You can see some examples in the Table below .
The freezing point of pure water is included in the table for comparison.
Freezing Point (째C)
Q:
What trend do you see in this table?
A:
Substances in the table with freezing points lower than water are gases.
Substances in the table with freezing points higher than water are solids.
Q:
Sodium is a solid at room temperature.
Given this information, what can you infer about its freezing point?
A:
You can infer that the freezing point of sodium must be higher than room temperature, which is about 20째C.
The freezing point of sodium is actually 98째C.
Freezing is the process in which a liquid changes to a solid.
