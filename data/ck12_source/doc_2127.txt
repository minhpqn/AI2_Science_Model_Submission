Strip mining is like open pit mining but with material removed along a strip.
A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads.

Open pit mining is a form of surface mining, extracting ores close to Earth's surface.
Placers are valuable minerals found in stream gravels.
California’s nickname, the Golden State, can be traced back to the discovery of placer deposits of gold in 1848.
The gold weathered out of hard metamorphic rock in the western Sierra Nevada.
The rock also contained deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, chromite, and other valuable minerals.
The gold traveled down rivers and then settled in gravel deposits.
Currently, California has active mines for gold and silver.
Non-metal minerals such as sand and gravel, which are used for construction, are also mined in California and elsewhere.
Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earth’s surface.
Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores.
An underground ore deposit can be approached from above, below, or sideways.
The direction depends on the placement of the ore body, its depth, the concentration of ore, and the strength of the surrounding rock.
An example of an underground mine can be seen below ( Figure below ).
Underground mining is very expensive and dangerous.
Fresh air and lights must also be brought into the tunnels for the miners.
Accidents are far too common.
