The mountain range separated as the continents drifted.
Climate is found in zones around the planet.
Warm tropical climates are mostly found near the Equator.
Glaciers are mostly found nearer the poles.
Wegener assumed that these things were true in the ancient past.
Wegener looked at evidence from ancient glaciers.
Glaciers are found in very cold climates near the poles.
The evidence left by some ancient glaciers is very close to the Equator.
Did glaciers once exist near the poles?
Wegener knew that this was extremely unlikely!
However, if the continents had moved, the glaciers would have been centered close to the South Pole.
Coral reefs are found only in warm water.
Coal swamps are also found in tropical and subtropical environments.
Wegener discovered ancient coal seams and coral reef fossils in areas that are much too cold today.
Wegener thought that ancient coral and coal plants existed at about the same latitude where they are found today.
He again stated that it was the continents that moved.

Alfred Wegener made an observation.
Africa and South America appeared to fit together like puzzle pieces.
