Work can be done on the gas in order to compress it.
If you plot pressure on the vertical axis and volume on the horizontal axis, the work done in any complete cycle is the area enclosed by the graph.
For a partial process, work is the area underneath the curve, or P\Delta\!V .
Question :A heat engine operates at a temperature of 650\mathrm{K} .
The work output is used to drive a pile driver, which is a machine that picks things up and drops them.
Heat is then exhausted into the atmosphere, which has a temperature of 300\mathrm{K} .
a) What is the ideal efficiency of this engine?
b) The engine drives a 1200\mathrm{kg} weight by lifting it 50m in 2.5 sec .
What is the engineâ€™s power output?
c) If the engine is operating at 50\% of ideal efficiency, how much power is being consumed?
d) How much power is exhausted?
e) The fuel the engine uses is rated at 2.7\times 10^6\mathrm{J/kg} .
How many kg of fuel are used in one hour?
a) We will plug the known values into the formula to get the ideal efficiency.
\eta = 1 -\frac{T_{\mathrm{cold}}}{T_\mathrm{hot}}=1-\frac{300\mathrm{K}}{650\mathrm{K}}=54\%
b) To find the power of the engine, we will use the power equation and plug in the known values.
P=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{Fd}{t}=\frac{mad}{t}=\frac{1200\mathrm{kg}\times 9.8\mathrm{m/s^2}\times 50\mathrm{m}}{2.5\mathrm{sec}}=240\mathrm{kW}
c) First, we know that it is operating at 50\% of ideal efficiency.
We also know that the max efficiency of this engine is 54\% .
So the engine is actually operating at .5\times 54\%=27\% of 100\% efficiency.
