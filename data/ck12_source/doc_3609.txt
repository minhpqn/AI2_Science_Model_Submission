Chromosome.
After DNA replicates, it forms chromosomes like the one shown here.
Chromosomes and Genes
The DNA of a chromosome is encoded with genetic instructions for making proteins.
These instructions are organized into units called genes .
Most genes contain the instructions for a single protein.
There may be hundreds or even thousands of genes on a single chromosome.
Human cells normally have two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent.
There are 23 chromosomes in each set, for a total of 46 chromosomes per cell.
Each chromosome in one set is matched by a chromosome of the same type in the other set, so there are actually 23 pairs of chromosomes per cell.
Each pair consists of chromosomes of the same size and shape that also contain the same genes.
The chromosomes in a pair are known as homologous chromosomes .
Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins.
Chromosomes form after DNA replicates; prior to replication, DNA exists as chromatin.
Chromosomes contain genes, which code for proteins.
Human cells normally have 46 chromosomes, made up of two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent.
