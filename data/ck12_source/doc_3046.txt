It’s just as massive as a very large building, but it’s not even resting on land.
It’s a giant cruise ship, and it’s floating on water.
The ship weighs about 100,000 metric tons.
How can such a tremendous weight float on water?
Why doesn’t it sink to the bottom of the ocean instead?

Archimedes Takes a Bath
Did you ever notice when you get into a bathtub of water that the level of the water rises?
More than 2000 years ago, a Greek mathematician named Archimedes noticed the same thing.
He observed that both a body and the water in a tub can’t occupy the same space at the same time.
As a result, some of the water is displaced, or moved out of the way.
