All the material moves together in big chunks.
Slumps may happen when a layer of slippery, wet clay is underneath the rock and soil on a hillside.
Or they may occur when a river (or road) undercuts a slope.
Slump leaves behind crescent-shaped scars on the hillside.

Creep is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside.
Creep occurs so slowly you canâ€™t see it happening.
You can only see the effects of creep after years of movement ( Figure below ).
The slowly moving ground causes trees, fence posts, and other structures on the surface to tilt downhill.

As the hillside moves down slope a tree tries to stand up straight.
The tree ends up with a bent trunk.
Prevention and Awareness
Landslides cause $1 billion to $2 billion damage in the United States each year.
Mass wasting is responsible for traumatic and sudden loss of life and homes in many areas of the world.
Some communities have developed landslide warning systems.
Around San Francisco Bay, the National Weather Service and the U.S.
Geological Survey use rain gauges to monitor soil moisture.
If soil becomes saturated, the weather service issues a warning.
