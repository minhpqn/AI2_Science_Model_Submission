The diagram represents an oxygen molecule, so it’s not a new compound.
Oxygen normally occurs in diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules.
Several other elements also occur as diatomic molecules: hydrogen, nitrogen, and all but one of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine).
At the URL below, you can see an animation of electron sharing in a molecule of chlorine.
Electron sharing in oxygen molecule
Q:
How many electrons do these two oxygen atoms share?
How many covalent bonds hold the oxygen molecule together?
A:
The two oxygen atoms share two pairs of electrons, so two covalent bonds hold the oxygen molecule together.
Why Covalent Bonds Form
Covalent bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons.
Look at the oxygen atoms in the Figure above .
Alone, each oxygen atom has six valence electrons.
By sharing two pairs of valence electrons, each oxygen atom has a total of eight valence electrons.
This fills its outer energy level, giving it the most stable arrangement of electrons.
The shared electrons are attracted to both oxygen nuclei, and this force of attraction holds the two atoms together in the oxygen molecule.
A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons.
Covalent bonds form only between atoms of nonmetals.
The two atoms that are held together in a covalent bond may be atoms of the same element or different elements.
