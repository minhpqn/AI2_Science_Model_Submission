Radar stands for ra dio d etection and r anging.
In police radar, a radar gun sends out short bursts of microwaves.
The microwaves reflect back from oncoming vehicles and are detected by a receiver in the radar gun.
The frequency of the reflected waves is used to compute the speed of the vehicles.
Radar is also used for tracking storms, detecting air traffic, and other purposes.
Radar can be used to measure the speed of moving cars
Q:
How are reflected microwaves used to determine the speed of oncoming cars (see Figure above )?
A:
As the car approaches the radar gun, the reflected microwaves get bunched up in front of the car.
Therefore, the waves the receiver detects have a higher frequency than they would if they were being reflected from a stationary object.
The faster the car is moving, the greater the increase in the frequency of the waves.
This is an example of the Doppler effect, which can also occur with sound waves.
Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelength, frequency, and energy.
The full range of electromagnetic waves makes up the electromagnetic spectrum.
Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with relatively long wavelengths and low frequencies.
They are used for microwave ovens, cell phones, and radar.
A cell phone encodes the sounds of the callerâ€™s voice in microwaves by changing the frequency of the waves.
The encoded microwaves then travel through the air to a cell tower and eventually to the receiver of the person being called.
The receiver decodes the microwaves and changes them back to sounds.
