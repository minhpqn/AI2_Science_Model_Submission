This flowchart shows how most fossils form.
Other Ways Fossils Form
Fossils may form in other ways.
With complete preservation, the organism doesn't change much.
As pictured below ( Figure below ), tree sap may cover an organism and then turn into amber .
The original organism is preserved so that scientists might be able to study its DNA.
Organisms can also be completely preserved in tar or ice.

Molds and casts are another way organisms can be fossilized.
A mold is an imprint of an organism left in rock.
The organism's remains break down completely.
Rock that fills in the mold resembles the original remains.
The fossil that forms in the mold is called a cast ( Figure below ).
Molds and casts usually form in sedimentary rock.
With compression ( Figure below ), an organism's remains are put under great pressure inside rock layers.
This leaves behind a dark stain in the rock.
