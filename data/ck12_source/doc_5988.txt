The skeleton (unbalanced) equation:
\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \overset{\text{elec}}{\rightarrow} \text{H}_2 (g)+\text{O}_2 (g)
Note the abbreviation “elec” above the arrow to indicate the passage of an electric current to initiate the reaction.
Balance the equation.
2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \overset{\text{elec}}{\rightarrow} 2\text{H}_2(g)+\text{O}_2(g)
Step 3:
Think about your result
The products are elements and the equation is balanced.
A definition of decomposition reaction and example reactions are given.
Write the reactions (including names and balanced equations) as requested on the following web site:
What is a decomposition reaction?
What is usually needed for a decomposition reaction to take place?
Are elements always the product of a decomposition reaction?
decomposition reaction:
A reaction in which a compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.
Define combustion reaction.
Write the products of combustion reactions when given the starting materials.
A marshmallow burning on a stick is a combustion reaction
How do you cook the perfect marshmallow?
Roasting marshmallows over an open fire is a favorite past-time for campers, outdoor cook-outs, and just gathering around a fire in the back yard.
