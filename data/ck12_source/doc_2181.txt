Motion and Appearance
Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise as viewed from its North Pole.
All of the other planets rotate counterclockwise.
Venus turns slowly, making only one turn every 243 days.
This is longer than a year on Venus!
It takes Venus only 225 days to orbit the Sun.
Because the orbit of Venus is inside Earth’s orbit, Venus always appears close to the Sun.
You can see Venus rising early in the morning, just before the Sun rises ( Figure below ).
For this reason, Venus is sometimes called “the morning star.” When it sets in the evening, just after the Sun sets, it may be called “the evening star.” Since planets only reflect the Sun’s light, Venus should not be called a star at all!
Venus is very bright because its clouds reflect sunlight very well.
Venus is the brightest object in the sky besides the Sun and the Moon.
Venus and the moon in the night sky

Like Mercury, but unlike Earth, Venus does not have a moon.
Venus has a very thick, toxic atmosphere.
Venus has lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The atmosphere has a very strong greenhouse effect and therefore traps a lot of heat.
Venus has fewer impact craters than Mercury or the Moon.
