Compare condensation to hydrolysis reactions.
Carbon.
Element number six.
Right in the middle of the first row of the Periodic Table.
So what?
Carbon is the most important element to life.
Without this element, life as we know it would not exist.
As you will see, carbon is the central element in compounds necessary for life-organic compounds.
These compounds include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.
The Significance of Carbon
Why is carbon so important to organisms?
The answer lies with carbonâ€™s unique properties.
Carbon has an exceptional ability to bind with a wide variety of other elements.
Carbon makes four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds, allowing carbon atoms to form multiple stable bonds with other small atoms, including hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
Carbon atoms can also form stable bonds with other carbon atoms.
In fact, a carbon atom may form single, double, or even triple bonds with other carbon atoms.
This allows carbon atoms to form a tremendous variety of very large and complex molecules.
Carbon has the ability to form very long chains of interconnecting C-C bonds.
This property allows carbon to form the backbone of organic compounds , carbon-containing compounds, which are the basis of all known organic life.
Nearly 10 million carbon-containing organic compounds are known.
