When you push down the lever to turn on the toaster, the metal heating element inside starts to glow orange or red almost instantly.
You can see the glowing heating element inside this yellow toaster.
The glowing metal shows that the heating element has become very hot.
It gets hot so quickly because metals are good conductors of thermal energy.
Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching.
Thermal conduction occurs when particles of warmer matter bump into particles of cooler matter and transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles.
Conduction is usually faster in certain solids and liquids than in gases.
Materials that are good conductors of thermal energy are called thermal conductors .
Metals are especially good thermal conductors because they have freely moving electrons that can transfer thermal energy quickly and easily.
Besides the heating element inside a toaster, another example of a thermal conductor is a metal radiator, like the one in the Figure below .
When hot water flows through the coils of the radiator, the metal quickly heats up by conduction and then radiates thermal energy into the surrounding air.
Metal radiators quickly heat up
Q:
Thermal conductors have many uses, but sometimes it’s important to prevent the transfer of thermal energy.
Can you think of an example?
A:
One example is staying warm on a cold day.
You will stay warmer if you can prevent the transfer of your own thermal energy to the outside air.
One way to retain your own thermal energy on a cold day is to wear clothes that trap air.
That’s because air, like other gases, is a poor conductor of thermal energy.
