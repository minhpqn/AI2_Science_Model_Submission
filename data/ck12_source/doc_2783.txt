The substance that dissolves it is called the solvent .
The solute is present in a lesser amount that the solvent.
When the solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles, which spread throughout the solvent.
Q:
In bronze, what are the solute and solvent?
A:
Because bronze consists mainly of copper, copper is the solvent and tin is the solute.
The two metals are combined in a hot, molten state, but they form a solid solution at room temperature.
Whatâ€™s Your State?
In the example of bronze, a solid (tin) is dissolved in another solid (copper).
However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution.
For example, in a saltwater solution, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water).
The Table below describes examples of solutions consisting of solutes and solvents in various states of matter.
