Light also provides energy to split water molecules into electrons, hydrogen ions, and oxygen gas.
The oxygen gas is released as “waste”, but it is the source of the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere.
The captured energy is stored in the bonds of molecules, NADPH and ATP.
Hydrogen ions are pumped into the thylakoids, forming an electrochemical gradient whose energy builds ATP molecules.
Summarize the events of the light reactions of photosynthesis.
What is photolysis and describe the importance of photolysis.
Explain the role of the first electron transport chain in the formation of ATP during the light reactions of photosynthesis.
What are the final products of the light reaction?
The Calvin Cycle - Advanced
Trace the flow of energy and materials through the Calvin cycle.
Other than being green, what do all these fruits and vegetables have in common?
They are full of energy.
Energy in the form of glucose.
Fruit and vegetable plants, like all plants, are autotrophs and producers, producing energy from sunlight.
The energy from sunlight is briefly held in NADPH and ATP, which is needed to drive the formation of sugars such as glucose.
And this all happens in the Calvin Cycle.
Photosynthesis Stage II:
The Calvin Cycle - Making Food “From Thin Air”
During the light-dependent stage of photosynthesis, two of the three reactants (water and light) were used to produce oxygen gas, one of the products (and essentially a waste product of this process).
All three necessary conditions are required – the chloroplast with chlorophyll pigments, and enzyme catalysts.
