There are 10 millimeters in 1 centimeter and 100 centimeters in 1 meter.
Metric prefixes are used to distinguish between units of different size.
These prefixes all derive from either Latin or Greek terms.
For example, mega comes from the Greek word \mu \acute{\varepsilon} \gamma\alpha\varsigma , meaning “great”
Table below lists the most common metric prefixes and their relationship to the central unit that has no prefix.
Length is used as an example to demonstrate the relative size of each prefixed unit.
1 gigameter (Gm) = 10 9 m
1 megameter (Mm) = 10 6 m
1 kilometer (km) = 1000 m
1 hectometer (hm) = 100 m
1 dekameter (dam) = 10 m
1 meter (m)
1 decimeter (dm) = 0.1 m
1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 m
1 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 m
1 micrometer (μm) = 10 -6 m
1 nanometer (nm) = 10 -9 m
1 picometer (pm) = 10 -12 m
There are more prefixes - some of them rarely used.
Have you ever heard of a zeptometer?
