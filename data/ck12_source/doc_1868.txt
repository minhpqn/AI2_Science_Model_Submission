Earthquakes, which may occur on Californiaâ€™s abundant faults, can also trigger landslides.
To be safe from landslides:
Be aware of your surroundings.
Notice changes in the natural world.
Look for cracks or bulges in hillsides, tilting of decks or patios, or leaning poles or fences when rainfall is heavy.
Sticking windows and doors can indicate ground movement.
This is because soil pushes slowly against a house and knocks windows and doors out of alignment.
Look for landslide scars.
Landslides are most likely to happen where they have occurred before.
Plant vegetation and trees on the hillside around your home.
This helps hold the soil in place.
Help to keep a slope stable by building retaining walls.
Installing good drainage in a hillside may keep the soil from getting saturated.
Landslides are sudden and massive falls of rock down a slope.
Landslides may be very destructive or even deadly.
Slump and creep are slower types of mass wasting.
Mudflows or lahars, which are volcanic mudflows, are mass movements that contain a lot of water.
Mass wasting is more likely to occur on slopes that are wet, have weak rock, or are undercut.
An earthquake or other ground shaking can trigger a landslide.
To avoid being in a landslide, be aware of signs in a hillside, such as cracks or bulges and old landslide scars.
