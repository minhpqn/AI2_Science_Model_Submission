Deductive Reasoning:
Deduction
Deduction involves determining a single fact from a general statement; it is only as accurate as the statement.
For example, we know that all organisms are made of cells and need to maintain homeostasis and must reproduce to stay alive.
Therefore, since humans are organisms, we can then deduce that humans are made of cells, maintain homeostasis and reproduce.
Deductions are based on valid reasoning.
The reasoning in the following argument is valid, because there is no way in which the reasons 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false:
Reason 1:
All humans are mortal.
Reason 2:
Albert Einstein is a human.
Conclusion:
Albert Einstein is mortal ( Figure below ).
Albert Einstein (1879â€“1955) Deductive reasoning has helped us determine that Albert Einstein is a mortal being.
Inductive Reasoning:
Induction
Induction involves determining a general statement that is very likely to be true from several facts.
For example, if we have had a test every Tuesday for the past three months, we will have a test next Tuesday (and every Tuesday after that).
Induction contrasts strongly with deduction.
Even in the best, strongest cases of induction, the truth of the reason does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.
