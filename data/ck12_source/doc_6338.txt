Read the material on pressure at the link below and answer the following questions:
How is pressure directly related to an equilibrium constant?
What is done to related pressures to moles?
If you decrease P, what has to happen to the mole fractions of C and D?
Why does the pressure increase in the middle picture?
How is the stress due to increased pressure relieved?
Why does an increase in pressure slow the rate of CaCO 3 decomposition?
Define a non-reversible reaction.
List the generic products of non-reversible reactions.
A fire is an irreversible reaction
Whereâ€™s the fire?
Fires are a part of life.
Some fires clear the land and allow new growth.
Other fires provide warmth on a cold night.
Unfortunately, many fires are destructive, leaving damage in their wake.
All fires leave the environment changed, never to revert back to the original situation.
The carbon dioxide and water generated by a fire go off into the atmosphere and do not return.
The change is permanent and irreversible.
Going to Completion
When one of the products of a reaction is removed from the chemical equilibrium system as soon as it is produced, the reverse reaction cannot establish itself and equilibrium is never reached.
