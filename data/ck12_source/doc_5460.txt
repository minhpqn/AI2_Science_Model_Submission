Recombinant DNA is engineered through the combination of two or more DNA strands, combining DNA sequences which would not normally occur together.
In other words, selected DNA (or the DNA of "interest") is inserted into an existing organismal genome, such as a bacterial plasmid DNA, or some other sort of vector.
The recombinant DNA can then be inserted into another cell, such as a bacterial cell, for amplification and possibly production of the resulting protein.
This process is called transformation , the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the uptake, incorporation, and expression of foreign genetic material.
Recombinant DNA technology was made possible by the discovery of restriction endonucleases.
In The RNA message is sometimes edited at , Rich Rioberts and Phil Sharp discuss the development of tools and techniques to analyze DNA.
Restriction Enzyme Digestion and Ligation
Restriction enzymes or restriction endonucleases are prokaryotic enzymes that recognize and cut DNA at specific sequences, called restriction sites.
It is believed that they evolved as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA, such as viral DNA.
Over 3,000 restriction enzymes have been identified.
Some of the more common restriction enzymes are shown in the table below, where up and down arrows show the sites of cleavage.
Restriction enzymes are named based on the prokaryotic organism they are isolated from.
For example, those isolated from Escherichia coli would begin with Eco.
As the Table below shows, digestion with the restriction enzymes will result in overlapping or blunt ends.
EcoRI produces overlapping "sticky" ends: the enzyme cleaves between the G and A on both strands.
On the other hand, SmaII restriction enzyme cleavage produces "blunt" ends.
The enzyme cleaves between the G and C on both strands.
