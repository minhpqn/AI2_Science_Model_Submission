What’s in a Word?
The words dependent and independent are used by students and teachers on a daily basis.
In fact, they are probably used quite frequently.
You may tell your parent or guardian that you are independent enough to go to the movies on your own with your friends.
You could say that when you bake a cake or make a cup of hot chocolate, the taste of these are dependent on what ingredients you use.
In the English language, the term dependent means to be unable to do without, whereas independent means to be free from any outside influence.
What about in mathematics?
What do the terms dependent and independent actually mean?
This lesson will explore the mathematics of independence and dependence.
What are Venn Diagrams and Why are They Used?
In probability, a Venn diagram is a graphic organizer that shows a visual representation for all possible outcomes of an experiment and the events of the experiment in ovals.
Normally, in probability, the Venn diagram will be a box with overlapping ovals inside.
Look at the diagram below:
The S represents all of the possible outcomes of an experiment.
It is called the sample space.
The ovals A and B represent the outcomes of the events that occur in the sample space.
Let’s look at an example.
Let’s say our sample space is the numbers from 1 to 10.
Event A is randomly choosing one of the odd numbers from 1 to 10, and event B is randomly choosing one of the prime numbers from 1 to 10.
Remember that a prime number is a number whose only factors are 1 and itself.
