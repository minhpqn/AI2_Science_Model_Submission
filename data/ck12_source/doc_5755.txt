Hydrogen and Alkali Metals
Identify the elements in group 1 of the periodic table.
Explain why group 1 elements are very reactive.
List other properties of alkali metals.
You probably think of water as a substance that can put out fires.
But some elements are so reactive that they burn in water.
In fact, they virtually explode in water.
Thatâ€™s what is happening in the photo above.
About 3 pounds of sodium were added to water, and the result was this explosive reaction.
Why is sodium such a reactive element?
In this lesson you will find out.
The First Group
Sodium (Na) is an element in group 1 of the periodic table of the elements.
This group (column) of the table is shown below.
It includes the nonmetal hydrogen (H) and six metals that are called alkali metals .
Elements in the same group of the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons.
These are the electrons in their outer energy level that can be involved in chemical reactions.
Valence electrons determine many of the properties of an element, so elements in the same group have similar properties.
All the elements in group 1 have just one valence electron.
