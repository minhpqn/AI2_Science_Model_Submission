The fetus rapidly puts on body fat and gains weight during the last couple of months.
By the end of the 38 th week, all of the organs are working, and the fetus is ready to be born.
This is when birth normally occurs.
A baby born before this time is considered premature.
The Amniotic Sac and Placenta
During pregnancy, other structures also develop inside the mother’s uterus.
They are the amniotic sac, placenta, and umbilical cord ( Figure below ).
The fetus is surrounded by the fluid-filled amniotic sac and is linked to the mother by the umbilical cord
Surrounding the fetus is the fluid-filled amniotic sac.
The placenta and umbilical cord are also shown here.
They provide a connection between the mother’s and fetus’s blood for the transfer of nutrients and gases.
The amniotic sac is a membrane that surrounds the fetus.
It is filled with water and dissolved substances, known as amniotic fluid.
Imagine placing a small plastic toy inside a balloon and then filling the balloon with water.
The toy would be cushioned and protected by the water.
It would also be able to move freely inside the balloon.
The amniotic sac and its fluid are like a water-filled balloon.
They cushion and protect the fetus.
They also let the fetus move freely inside the uterus.
The placenta is a spongy mass of blood vessels.
