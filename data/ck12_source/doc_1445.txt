How do glaciers serve as a water resource for people and organisms in the summertime?
Introduction to Groundwater
Define aquifer and explain how aquifers form and recharge.
What are these faucets tapping into?
This certainly is an odd sight!
We expect to see water at Earth's surface, but coming out of solid rock?
Amazingly, much of Earth's fresh water is hidden from sight.
It is present in rock and soil.
In fact, 20 times more of Earth’s liquid freshwater is found below the surface than on the surface.
Freshwater below Earth’s surface is called groundwater .
The water infiltrates, or seeps down into, the ground from the surface.
How does this happen?
And where does the water go?
Porous and Impermeable Rock
Water infiltrates the ground because soil and rock may have air spaces between the grains.
These pores, or tiny holes, result in the rock's porosity .
If water can move through a rock, the rock is permeable .
Eventually, the water reaches a layer of rock that is not porous.
This rock is impermeable .
Water stops moving downward when it reaches an impermeable layer.
