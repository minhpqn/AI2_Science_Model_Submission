Oil is a type of lipid.
Lipids are molecules such as fats, oils, and waxes.
The most common lipids in your diet are probably fats and oils.
Fats are solid at room temperature, whereas oils are fluid.
Animals use fats for long-term energy storage and to keep warm.
Plants use oils for long-term energy storage.
When preparing food, we often use animal fats, such as butter, or plant oils, such as olive oil or canola oil.
There are many more type of lipids that are important to life.
One of the most important are the phospholipids that make up the protective outer membrane of all cells ( Figure below ).
These lipid membranes are impermeable to most water soluble compounds.

Nucleic acids are long chains of nucleotides.
Nucleotides are made of a sugar, a nitrogen-containing base, and a phosphate group.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the two main nucleic acids.
DNA is a double-stranded nucleic acid.
DNA is the molecule that stores our genetic information ( Figure below ).
