This pattern of stripes is like what they discovered on the seafloor.
In this image, there is a dusky purple stripe in the center.
Other colored stripes are symmetrical about the dusky purple stripe.
In the oceans, magnetic stripes are symmetrical about a mid-ocean ridge axis.
What does this have to do with continental drift?
Warships also carried magnetometers.
Like the echo sounders, the magnetometers were used to search for submarines.
The magnetometers also revealed a lot about the magnetic properties of the seafloor.
Looking at the magnetism of the seafloor, scientists discovered something astonishing.
Many times in Earthâ€™s history, the magnetic poles have switched positions.
North becomes south, and south becomes north!
When the north and south poles are aligned as they are now, geologists say it is normal polarity .
When they are in the opposite position, they say that it is reversed polarity .
Scientists were even more surprised to discover a pattern of magnetism on the seafloor.
There are stripes with different magnetism.
Some stripes have normal polarity and some have reversed polarity.
These stripes surround the mid-ocean ridges.
There is one long stripe with normal magnetism at the top of the ridge.
Next to that stripe are two long stripes with reversed magnetism.
One is on either side of the normal stripe.
