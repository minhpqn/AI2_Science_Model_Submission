This effect manifests itself by causing time to go slower near a massive object.
The theory suggests that time on the top of a mountain runs faster than it does at sea level.
Gravity's slowing down of time also affects the frequency of light waves and therefore their color.
Light becomes bluer as it approaches a massive object and redder as it moves away.
This effect was first observed in 1960 by Robert Pound and Glen Rebka, who shot gamma rays up to the top of a building and measured the change in their color as they got farther away from the Earth.
Masses placed in space cause the space to be curved.
Curved space causes masses moving in a straight line to follow a curved path.
Curved space also caused time to run more slowly.
