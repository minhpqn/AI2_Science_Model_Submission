Object inside the focal point
Once again, we can trace two rays to locate the image.
A ray that originates at the focal point and passes through the tip of the object will reflect parallel to the principal axis.
The second ray we trace is the ray that leaves the tip of the object and strikes the mirror parallel to the principal axis.
Below is the ray diagram for this situation.
The rays are reflected from the mirror and as they leave the mirror, they diverge.
These two rays will never come back together and so a real image is not possible.
When an observer looks into the mirror, however, the eye will trace the rays backward as if they had followed a straight line.
The dotted lines in the sketch show the lines the rays would have followed behind the mirror.
The eye will see an image behind the mirror just as if the rays of light had originated behind the mirror.
The image seen will be enlarged and upright.
Since the light does not actually pass through this image position, the image is virtual.
Virtual image formed by a concave mirror
Example Problem:
A 1.00 cm tall object is placed 10.0 cm from a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 30.0 cm.
Determine the image distance and image size.
Solution:
Since the radius of curvature is 30.0 cm, the focal length is 15.0 cm.
The object distance of 10.0 cm tells us that the object is between the focal point and the mirror.
\frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f}  and plugging known values yields  \frac{1}{10.0}+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{15}
