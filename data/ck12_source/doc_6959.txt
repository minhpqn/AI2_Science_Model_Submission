Generators and Motors
Describe how a generator (and thus motor) works.
Students will learn how a generator (and thus motor) works.
The lesson is on a conceptual basis and compliments the lesson on electromagnetic induction.
emf = -\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}&& \text{Faraday's Law of Induction} \Phi = N \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} &&\text{ Electromagnetic Flux}
