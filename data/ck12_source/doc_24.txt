Scientists who work outdoors are also required to follow safety regulations.
These safety regulations are designed to prevent harm to themselves, other humans, animals, and the environment.
If scientists work outside the country, they are required to learn about and follow the laws and restrictions of the country in which they are doing research.
For example, entomologists following monarch butterfly ( Figure below ) migrations between the United States and Mexico must follow regulations in both countries.
Before biologists can study protected wildlife or plant species, they must apply for permission to do so, usually from the government.
This is important to protect these fragile species.
For example, if scientists collect rare butterflies, they must first get a permit.
They must also be careful to not disturb the habitat.
