Scientists used carbon-14 dating to estimate its age.
Carbon-14 is one of several radioisotopes that scientists use to estimate the ages of fossils and other ancient materials.
What Are Radioisotopes?
All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, but they may have different numbers of neutrons.
Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive.
These isotopes are called radioisotopes .
Their nuclei are unstable, so they break down, or decay, and emit radiation.
Q:
What makes the nucleus of a radioisotope unstable?
A:
The nucleus may be unstable because it has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons.
For a nucleus with a small number of protons to be stable, the ratio of protons to neutrons should be 1:1.
For a nucleus with a large number of protons to be stable, the ratio should be about 1:1.5.
An Example:
Carbon-14
Find carbon in the Figure below , and youâ€™ll see that its atomic number is 6.
This means that all carbon atoms have 6 protons per nucleus.
Almost all carbon atoms also have 6 neutrons per nucleus.
These carbon atoms are called carbon-12, where 12 is the number of protons (6) plus neutrons (6).
