How is evolution defined in this resource?
How is macroevolution related to microevolution?
How are genetic changes introduced?
What is genetic drift?
Compare microevolution to macroevolution.
Why are populations, rather than individuals, the units of evolution?
What is a gene pool?
Assume that a population of 50 individuals has the following numbers of genotypes for a gene with two alleles, B and b :
BB = 30, Bb = 10, and bb = 10.
Calculate the frequencies of the two alleles in the populationâ€™s gene pool.
Define Hardy-Weinberg theorem and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
State the conditions required for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Summarize the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation.
Why is balance important?
To these individuals, the importance of maintaining balance is obvious.
If balance, or equilibrium, is maintained within a population's genes, can evolution occur?
No.
But maintaining this type of balance today is difficult.
The Hardy-Weinberg Theorem
Godfrey Hardy was an English mathematician.
