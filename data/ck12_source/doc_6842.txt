The sea urchin mainly feeds on algae on the coral and rocks, along with decomposing matter such as dead fish, mussels, sponges, and barnacles.
Deposit feeders, which are organisms that feed on small pieces of organic matter, usually in the top layer of soil.
Sea cucumbers are deposit feeders, living on the ocean floor.
They eat the tiny scrap particles that are usually abundant in the environments that they inhabit.
Active hunters, which are organisms that actively hunt their prey.
Many sea stars are predators, feeding on mollusks like clams by prying apart their shells and actually placing their stomach inside the mollusk shell to digest the meat.
How do Echinoderms Reproduce?
Echinoderms reproduce sexually.
In most echinoderms, eggs and sperm cells are released into open water, and fertilization takes place when the eggs and sperm meet.
This is called external fertilization, and is typical of many marine animals.
The release of sperm and eggs often occurs when organisms are in the same place at the same time.
Internal fertilization takes place in only a few species.
Some species even take care of their offspring, like parents!
Echinoderms show radial symmetry and have an endoskeleton and a unique water vascular system.
Some have spines.
Echinoderms generally reproduce by external fertilization; regeneration is fairly common among echinoderms.
