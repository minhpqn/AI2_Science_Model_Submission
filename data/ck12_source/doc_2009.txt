This is done by certain bacteria in the soil.
It’s called “fixing” nitrogen.
Human Actions and the Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients needed by plants.
That’s why most plant fertilizers contain nitrogen.
Adding fertilizer to soil allows more plants to grow.
As a result, a given amount of land can produce more food.
So far, so good.
But what happens next?
Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil.
Runoff carries it away.
The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans.
Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water.
Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control.
Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ).
Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water.
After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue.
The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water.
This creates a dead zone.
A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen.
