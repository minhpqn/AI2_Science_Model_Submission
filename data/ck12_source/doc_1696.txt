Lightning and Thunder
During a thunderstorm, some parts of a thunderhead become negatively charged.
Other parts become positively charged.
The difference in charge creates lightning.
Lightning ( Figure below ) is a huge release of electricity.
Lightning can jump between oppositely charged parts of the same cloud, between one cloud and another, or between a cloud and the ground.
Lightning blasts the air with energy.
The air heats and expands so quickly that it explodes.
This creates the loud sound of thunder .
Do you know why you always hear the boom of thunder after you see the flash of lightning?
Itâ€™s because light travels faster than sound.
If you count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder, you can estimate how far away the lightning was.
A lapse of five seconds is equal to about a mile.
