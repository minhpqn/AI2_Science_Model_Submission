Describe the ways in which scientists can learn about what's in Earth's interior.
How deep can we go into Earth's interior?
Not very deep, that's for sure!
The deepest a drill hole has gotten was the Kola Superdeep Borehole.
That hole got to 40,230 feet (12,262 m), about one-third of the way into the crust in that area.
So learning about what's deeper requires less direct methods.
