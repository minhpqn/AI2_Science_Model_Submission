Do you ever notice how your hair stands up when you are cold or afraid?
Tiny muscles in the dermis pull on hair follicles which cause hair to stand up.
The resulting little bumps in the skin are commonly called "goosebumps" ( Figure below ).

Oil Glands and Sweat Glands
Glands and hair follicles open out into the epidermis, but they start in the dermis.
Oil glands ( Figure above ) release, or secrete an oily substance, called sebum , into the hair follicle.
Sebum “waterproofs” hair and the skin surface to prevent them from drying out.
It can also stop the growth of bacteria on the skin.
It is odorless, but the breakdown of sebum by bacteria can cause odors.
If an oil gland becomes plugged and infected, it develops into a pimple.
Up to 85% of teenagers get pimples, which usually go away by adulthood.
Frequent washing can help decrease the amount of sebum on the skin.
Sweat glands ( Figure above ) open to the skin surface through skin pores.
They are found all over the body.
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface helps to lower skin temperature.
The skin also releases excess water, salts, sugars, and other wastes, such as ammonia and urea, in sweat.

Skin serves many functions, from acting as a barrier that keeps particles and water out of the body, to helping to cool the body.
