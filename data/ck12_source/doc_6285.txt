Sodium and chlorine react to form sodium chloride (see video below).
Hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water.
Like other reactions, these are accompanied by either the absorption or release of heat.
The standard heat of formation (\Delta H{_f}^\circ) is the enthalpy change associated with the formation of one mole of a compound from its elements in their standard states.
The standard conditions for thermochemistry are 25°C and 101.3 kPa.
Therefore, the standard state of an element is its state at 25°C and 101.3 kPa.
For example, iron is a solid, bromine is a liquid, and oxygen is a gas under those conditions.
The standard heat of formation of an element in its standard state is by definition equal to zero.
The  \Delta H{_f}^\circ=0 for the diatomic elements, H 2 (g), N 2 (g), O 2 (g), F 2 (g), Cl 2 (g), Br 2 (l), and I 2 (g).
The graphite form of solid carbon is its standard state with \Delta H{_f}^\circ = 0 , while diamond is not its standard state.
Some standard heats of formation are listed in the Table below .
