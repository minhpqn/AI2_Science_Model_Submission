Now letâ€™s draw the Venn diagram to represent this example.
We know that:
S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\!\\A = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}\!\\B = \{2, 3, 5, 7\} Notice that 3 of the prime numbers are part of both sets and are, therefore, in the overlapping part of the Venn diagram.
The numbers 4, 6, 8, and 10 are the numbers not part of A or B, but they are still members of the sample space.
Now you try.
Example 1 2 coins are tossed one after the other.
Event A consists of the outcomes when tossing heads on the first toss.
Event B consists of the outcomes when tossing heads on the second toss.
Draw a Venn diagram to represent this example.
Solution:
We know that:
S = \{HH,HT, TH, TT\}\!\\A = \{HH,HT\}\!\\B = \{HH,TH\} Notice that event A and event B share the Heads + Heads outcome and that the sample space contains Tails + Tails, which is neither in event A nor event B.
Example 2 Event A represents randomly choosing a student from ABC High School who holds a part-time job.
Event B represents randomly choosing a student from ABC High School who is on the honor roll.
Draw a Venn diagram to represent this example.
Solution:
We know that:
S = {students in ABC High School} A = {students holding a part-time job} B = {students on the honor roll} Notice that the overlapping oval for A and B represents the students who have a part-time job and are on the honor roll.
The sample space, S, outside the ovals represents students neither holding a part-time job nor on the honor roll.
In a Venn diagram, when events A and B occur, the symbol used is \cap.
