A thin layer of clay was deposited over much of Earth’s surface.
The clay has large amount of the element iridium.
Iridium is rare on Earth but common in asteroids.
This unusual clay layer has been used to match rock up layers all over the world.
It also led to the hypothesis that a giant asteroid struck Earth and caused the dinosaurs to go extinct.
Using Index Fossils
Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers in different places ( Figure below ).
If two rock layers have the same index fossils, then they’re probably about the same age.

Using Index Fossils to Match Rock Layers.
Rock layers with the same index fossils must have formed at about the same time.
The presence of more than one type of index fossil provides stronger evidence that rock layers are the same age.
A single rock unit contains the story of the geology of that location.
To understand the geology of a region, scientists use correlation.
To correlate rock units, something distinctive must be present in each.
This can include an index fossil, a unique rock type, a key bed, or a unique sequence of rocks.
A key bed can be global.
An example is the iridium layer that was deposited at the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions.
