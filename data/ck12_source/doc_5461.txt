Cloning of a segment of DNA of interest can easily be carried out with restriction enzyme digestion, followed by ligation and transformation or transfection.
In the classical restriction enzyme digestion and ligation cloning protocols, cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps:
isolation of the DNA of interest (or target DNA),
transfection (or transformation), and
a screening/selection procedure.

Isolation of DNA
Initially, the DNA fragment to be cloned must be isolated.
This DNA of interest may be a gene, part of a gene, a promoter, or another segment of DNA, and is frequently isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or restriction enzyme digestion.
As discussed above, a restriction enzyme is an enzyme that cuts double-stranded DNA at a specific sequence.
The enzyme makes two incisions, one through each strand of the double helix, without damaging the nitrogenous bases.
