The video "Walking with Monsters" is a depiction of the evolution of life from water onto land:  (4:43).
Evolution of Chordates
Another major step in animal evolution was the evolution of a notochord.
A notochord is a rigid rod that runs the length of the body.
It supports the body and gives it shape (see Figure below ).
It also provides a place for muscles to anchor, and counterbalances them when they contract.
Animals with a notochord are called chordates.
They also have a hollow nerve cord that runs along the top of the body.
Gill slits and a tail are two other chordate features.
Many modern chordates have some of these structures only as embryos.
A tunicate, which is a primitive, deep-sea chordate
This tunicate is a primitive, deep-sea chordate.
It is using its notochord to support its head, while it waits to snatch up prey in its big mouth.
Evolution of Vertebrates
Vertebrates evolved from primitive chordates.
This occurred about 550 million years ago.
The earliest vertebrates may have been jawless fish, like the hagfish in Figure below .
Vertebrates evolved a backbone to replace the notochord after the embryo stage.
They also evolved a cranium , or bony skull, to enclose and protect the brain.
Hagfish are very simple vertebrates
