The chromosomes line up one on top of each other along the middle of the cell, similar to how they line up in mitosis.
The spindle is attached to the centromere of each chromosome.
Anaphase II:
The sister chromatids separate as the spindle shortens and move to opposite ends of the cell.
Telophase II:
A nuclear envelope forms around the chromosomes in all four cells.
This is followed by cytokinesis.
After cytokinesis, each cell has divided again.
Therefore, meiosis results in four haploid genetically unique daughter cells, each with half the DNA of the parent cell ( Figure below ).
In human cells, the parent cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), so the cells produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes.
These cells will become gametes.
An overview of meiosis
An overview of meiosis.
Meiosis is a process of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half and produces sex cells, or gametes.
Meiosis is divided into two parts:
Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
Each part is similar to mitosis and can be divided into the same phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
Crossing-over occurs only during prophase I.
Four genetically unique haploid cells result from meiosis.
