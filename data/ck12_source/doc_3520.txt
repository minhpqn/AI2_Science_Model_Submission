Only chromosomes stain clearly enough to be seen under a microscope.
The word chromosome comes from the Greek word chroma (color), and soma (body), due to its ability to be stained strongly by dyes.
The Nuclear Envelope
The nuclear envelope is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material.
It separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm.
The nuclear envelope is made of two lipid bilayers, an inner membrane and an outer membrane.
The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope.
These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
The nucleus of many cells also contains a non-membrane bound organelle called a nucleolus , shown in Figure below .
The nucleolus is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes.
Ribosomes are organelles made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm.
The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding the genetic messages within another type of RNA (called mRNA), into amino acids.
After being made in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm, where they direct protein synthesis.
Organelles in a cell
The eukaryotic cell nucleus.
Visible in this diagram are the ribosome-studded double membranes of the nuclear envelope, the DNA (as chromatin), and the nucleolus.
Within the cell nucleus is a viscous liquid called nucleoplasm, similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus.
The chromatin (which is normally invisible), is visible in this figure only to show that it is spread throughout the nucleus.
The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle, found in most eukaryotic cells, which stores the genetic material (DNA).
