The genetic information is a set of instructions that tell your cells what to do.
DNA is an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid .
As you may recall, nucleic acids are a type of macromolecule that store information.
The deoxyribo part of the name refers to the name of the sugar that is contained in DNA, deoxyribose.
DNA may provide the instructions to make up all living things, but it is actually a very simple molecule.
DNA is made of a very long chain of nucleotides.
In fact, in you, the smallest DNA molecule has well over 20 million nucleotides.
Nucleotides are composed of three main parts:
a phosphate group.
a 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA).
a nitrogen-containing base.
The only difference between each nucleotide is the identity of the base.
There are only four possible bases that make up each DNA nucleotide: adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).
The Genetic Code
The various sequences of the four nucleotide bases make up the genetic code of your cells.
It may seem strange that there are only four letters in the “alphabet” of DNA.
But since your chromosomes contain millions of nucleotides, there are many, many different combinations possible with those four letters.
But how do all these pieces fit together?
James Watson and Francis Crick won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for piecing together the structure of DNA.
Together with the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, they determined that DNA is made of two strands of nucleotides formed into a double helix , or a two-stranded spiral, with the sugar and phosphate groups on the outside, and the paired bases connecting the two strands on the inside of the helix ( Figure below ).
