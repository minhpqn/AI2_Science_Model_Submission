Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that uses an RNA intermediate to elongate the 3' end of DNA strands in the telomere regions after each replication cycle.
RNA replication is the copying of one RNA to another.
Many RNA viruses copy their RNA using RNA replication.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are the enzymes specific for this process, as opposed DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which catalyzes the transcription of RNA from a DNA template.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is also known as RNA replicase.
These enzymes are found in many eukaryotic cells, where they are involved in RNA silencing.
RNA silencing refers to mechanisms of gene silencing, in which the expression of one or more genes is downregulated or entirely suppressed by the binding of an antisense RNA molecule.
An antisense RNA molecule is a single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a mRNA strand transcribed within a cell.
These two RNAs bind to each other and prevent translation.
RNA interference is a form of gene silencing.
allele :
An alternative form or different version of a gene.
antisense RNA :
A single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to a messenger RNA strand transcribed within a cell.
biopolymer :
Polymers produced by living organisms; composed of linked monomers such as nucleotides or amino acids; includes DNA, RNA, and proteins.
central dogma of molecular biology :
A framework for understanding the transfer of sequence information between sequential information-carrying biopolymers DNA, RNA, and protein.
gene :
A segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a single polypeptide.
