Different greenhouse gases have different abilities to trap heat.
For example, one methane molecule traps 23 times as much heat as one CO 2 molecule.
One CFC-12 molecule (a type of CFC) traps 10,600 times as much heat as one CO 2 .
Still, CO 2 is a very important greenhouse gas, because it is much more abundant in the atmosphere.
Greenhouse gases include CO 2 , H 2 O, methane, O 3 , nitrous oxides (NO and NO 2 ), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the troposphere.
Some greenhouse gases can trap more heat than others.
Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing due to human activities.
