Transcription Factors (Advanced) concept.
Mechanisms of Transcriptional Regulation
Transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase can be regulated by at least five mechanisms:
Specificity factors are proteins that alter the specificity of RNA polymerase for a promoter or set of promoters, making it more or less likely to bind to the promoter and begin transcription.
Repressors are proteins that bind to non-coding sequences on the DNA that are close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand.
Basal factors are transcription factors that help position RNA polymerase at the start of a gene.
Enhancers are sites on the DNA strand that are bound by activators in order to loop the DNA, bringing a specific promoter to the initiation complex.
An initiation complex is composed of RNA polymerase and numerous trans-acting factors.
Activators are proteins that enhance the interaction between RNA polymerase and a particular promoter.
As the organism grows more sophisticated, gene regulation becomes more complex, though prokaryotic organisms possess some highly regulated systems.
Some human genes are controlled by many activators and repressors working together.
Obviously, a mutation in a cis-regulatory region, such as the promoter, can greatly affect the proper expression of a gene.
It may keep the gene permanently off, such that no protein can be made, or it can keep the gene permanently on, such that the corresponding protein is constantly made.
Both of these can have detremental effects on the cell.
Regulation of Transcription.
Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements to control transcription.
The regulatory elements are embedded within the DNA.
