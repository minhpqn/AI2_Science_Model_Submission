What do these foods have in common?

Diabetes is a non-infectious disease in which the body is unable to control the amount of sugar in the blood.
People with diabetes have high blood sugar, either because their bodies do not produce enough insulin, or because their cells do not respond to insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that helps cells take up sugar from the blood.
Without enough insulin, the blood contains too much sugar.
This can damage blood vessels and other cells throughout the body.
The kidneys work hard to filter out and remove some of the extra sugar.
This leads to frequent urination and excessive thirst.
There are two main types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
