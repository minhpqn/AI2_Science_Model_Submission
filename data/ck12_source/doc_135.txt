Mammals usually give birth to live offspring.
But there are some mammals that do lay eggs.
You probably realize that cats, dogs, people, and other mammals don't typically lay eggs.
There are exceptions, however.
Egg-laying is possible among the monotremes, mammals with birdlike and reptilian characteristics.
Recall that mammals can be classified into three general groups, based on their reproductive strategy: the monotremes, the marsupials and the placental mammals.
The egg-laying monotremes, such as echidnas ( Figure below ) and platypuses ( Figure below ), use one opening, the cloaca , to urinate, release waste, and reproduce, just like birds.
They lay leathery eggs, similar to those of lizards, turtles, and crocodilians.
Monotremes feed their young by “sweating” milk from patches on their bellies, as they lack the nipples present on other mammals.
A Echidna and Platypus are both mammals, but lay eggs
The echidna ( right ) is a member of the monotremes, the most primitive order of mammals.
Another monotreme, the platypus ( left ), like other mammals in this order, lays eggs and has a single opening for the urinary, genital, and digestive organs.
All other mammals give birth to live young and belong to one of two different categories, the marsupials and the placental mammals.
A marsupial is an animal in which the embryo, which is often called a joey, is born at an immature stage.
Development must be completed outside the mother's body.
Most female marsupials have an abdominal pouch or skin fold where there are mammary glands.
The pouch is a place for completing the development of the baby.
Although blind, without fur, and with only partially formed hind legs, the tiny newborns have well developed forelimbs with claws that enable them to climb their way into their mother's pouch where they drink their mother's milk and continue their development.
Marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums.
Other marsupials are the wallaby and the Tasmanian Devil.
