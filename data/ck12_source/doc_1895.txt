The laws of stratigraphy are usually credited to a geologist from Denmark named Nicolas Steno.
He lived in the 1600s.
The laws are illustrated in the Figure below ; refer to the figure as you read about Steno's laws below.

Law of Superposition
Superposition refers to the position of rock layers and their relative ages ( Figure below ).
Relative age means age in comparison with other rocks, either younger or older.
The relative ages of rocks are important for understanding Earth’s history.
New rock layers are always deposited on top of existing rock layers.
Therefore, deeper layers must be older than layers closer to the surface.
This is the law of superposition.

Superposition.
The rock layers at the bottom of this cliff are much older than those at the top.
What force eroded the rocks and exposed the layers?
Law of Lateral Continuity
Rock layers extend laterally, or out to the sides.
They may cover very broad areas, especially if they formed at the bottom of ancient seas.
Erosion may have worn away some of the rock, but layers on either side of eroded areas will still “match up.”
