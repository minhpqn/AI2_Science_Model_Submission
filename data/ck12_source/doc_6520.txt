Lead and tungsten are large atoms with many protons and neutrons in their nuclei.
While the beta electron may be blocked, the target material could become irradiated in the process.
High-density materials are much more effective protection against gamma emissions than low-density ones.
Gamma rays are usually blocked effectively by lead shielding.
The thickness of the shielding will determine the effectiveness of the protection offered by the lead.
The relative penetrating abilities of radioactive emissions are described.
