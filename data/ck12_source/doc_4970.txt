Family of cell surface receptors for many polypeptide growth factors, cytokines, and hormones; specifically phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids; also known as receptor tyrosine kinases.
Signal transduction begins with a ligand binding to its receptor.
Cell-surface receptors bind a ligand outside of the cell and internalize the signal, acting through a second messenger.
Nuclear receptors bind a ligand inside the cell and change transcription of genes by acting as a transcription factor.
