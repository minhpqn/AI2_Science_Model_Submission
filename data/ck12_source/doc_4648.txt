A few of the developments that occur in the embryo during weeks 4 through 8 are listed in Figure below .
As the embryo develops, it also grows in size.
By the eighth week of development, the embryo is about 30 millimeters (just over 1 inch) in length.
It may also have begun to move.
Embryonic Development: weeks 4-8.
Embryonic Development (Weeks 4â€“8).
Most organs develop in the embryo during weeks 4 through 8.
If the embryo is exposed to toxins during this period, the effects are likely to be very damaging.
Can you explain why? (Note: the drawings of the embryos are not to scale.)
The embryonic stage begins with implantation.
An embryo forms three distinct cell layers, and each layer develops into different types of cells and organs.
Guess the Embryo at
Explain how the embryo forms specialized cells.
What organs eventually develop from the ectoderm cell layer?
Which cell layer develops into muscle tissues?
