Forces between atoms or molecules are not strong enough to hold them together, allowing the molecules to move independently of one another.
A liquid is a state of matter in which atoms or molecules are constantly in contact but have enough energy to keep changing positions relative to one another.
Forces between atoms or molecules are strong enough to keep the molecules together but not strong enough to prevent them from moving.
The particles of a liquid have enough energy to allow them to slide past one another, but not enough energy to allow them to move freely.
A solid is a state of matter in which atoms or molecules do not have enough energy to move.
They are constantly in contact and in fixed positions relative to one another.
Forces between atoms or molecules are strong enough to keep the molecules together and to prevent them from moving.
The particles of a solid only have enough energy to vibrate in place.
States of Matter.
All three containers contain a substance with the same mass, but the substances are in different states.
In the left-hand container, the substance is a gas, which has spread to fill its container.
It takes both the shape and volume of the container.
In the middle container, the substance is a liquid, which has spread to take the shape of its container but not the volume.
In the right-hand container, the substance is a solid, which takes neither the shape nor the volume of its container.
What Determines a Substance’s State?
A substance's state depends partly on temperature and air pressure.
For example, at the air pressure found at sea level, water exists as a liquid at temperatures between 0°C and 100°C.
Above 100°C, water exists as a gas (water vapor).
Below 0°C, water exists as a solid (ice).
Different substances have a different range of temperatures at which they exist in each state.
