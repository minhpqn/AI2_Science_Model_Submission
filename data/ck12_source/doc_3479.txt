As you view Enzyme Animation, focus on this concept:
how enzymes function.
How enzyme changes activation energy
The reaction represented by this graph is a combustion reaction involving the reactants glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and oxygen (O 2 ).
The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O).
Energy is also released during the reaction.
The enzyme speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to start.
Compare the activation energy with and without the enzyme.
Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react.
For example:
Enzymes bring reactants together so they don’t have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random.
Enzymes bind both reactant molecules (called the substrate ), tightly and specifically, at a site on the enzyme molecule called the active site ( Figure below ).
By binding reactants at the active site, enzymes also position reactants correctly, so they do not have to overcome intermolecular forces that would otherwise push them apart.
This allows the molecules to interact with less energy.
Enzymes may also allow reactions to occur by different pathways that have lower activation energy.
The active site is specific for the reactants of the biochemical reaction the enzyme catalyzes.
Similar to puzzle pieces fitting together, the active site can only bind certain substrates.
Enzyme binding reactant at active site
This enzyme molecule binds reactant molecules—called substrate—at its active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex.
This brings the reactants together and positions them correctly so the reaction can occur.
