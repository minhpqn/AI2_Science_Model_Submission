How do scientists learn about the origins of life?
Metabolism and Replication
Describe the relationship between nucleic acids and replication.
What is an RNA world?
DNA passes most genetic information today.
But some scientists think that for the first life on Earth, genetic information was passed by RNA.
They call this the RNA world hypothesis.
Organic molecules must carry out the chemical work of cells.
This is their metabolism .
Living organisms need chemical reactions to live, grow, and reproduce.
The chemical reactions occur in sequences of steps.
These sequences are known as metabolic pathways.
The metabolic pathways are very similar for all life on Earth.
That includes single celled bacteria that have been around for billions of years.
It includes the most complex life forms on Earth today.
What does it mean that the metabolic pathways are so similar for all life?
This means that the metabolic pathways evolved very early in Earth's history.
Living cells need organic molecules, known as nucleic acids .
Nucleic acids are molecules that store genetic information.
They pass that genetic information to the next generation.
