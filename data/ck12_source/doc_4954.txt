The free phosphate phosphorylates the sodium-potassium pump.
A conformational change in the pump exposes the Na + ions to the outside.
The phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for Na + ions, so they are released.
The pump binds two extracellular K + ions.
This causes the dephosphorylation of the pump, reverting it to its previous conformational state, transporting the K + ions into the cell.
The unphosphorylated form of the pump has a higher affinity for Na + ions than K + ions, so the two bound K + ions are released.
ATP binds, and the process starts again.

Na + /K + -ATPase :
An active transport carrier protein/a transmembrane ATPase; moves sodium and potassium ions against large concentration gradients; the sodium-potassium pump.
resting potential :
The membrane potential of a cell/neuron at rest; the membrane potential of an unstimulated neuron.
sodium-potassium pump :
An active transport carrier protein/a transmembrane ATPase; moves sodium and potassium ions against large concentration gradients; the Na + /K + -ATPase.
The sodium-potassium pump is an example of an active transport membrane protein/transmembrane ATPase.
Using the energy from ATP, the sodium-potassium moves three sodium ions out of the cell and brings two potassium ions into the cell.
