Worldwide though, human ingenuity has not placed a limit on the population.
Not only does the population increase, the rate of population growth increases.
There is a sign that population growth is slowing.
Although population continues to grow rapidly, the rate that the growth rate is increasing has declined.
Still, a recent estimate by the United Nations claims that 10.1 billion people will be sharing this planet by the end of the century.
The total added will be about 3 billion people.
That number is more than were even in existence as recently as 1960.
Yet that is much less than the number we would expect if 1 billion people were being added every 12 years.
The human population is growing more than exponentially.
The rate of human population growth is still increasing.
However, the rate at which the rate of growth is increasing has declined.
The United Nations estimates a population of 10.1 billion by the end of the century.
