Red blood cells ( left ) are specialized to carry oxygen in the blood.
Neurons ( center ) are shaped to conduct electrical impulses to many other nerve cells.
These epidermal cells ( right ) make up the “skin” of plants.
Note how the cells fit tightly together.
Levels of Organization
While cells are the basic units of an organism, groups of cells can perform a job together.
These cells are called specialized because they have a special job.
Specialized cells can be organized into tissues .
For example, your liver cells are organized into liver tissue.
Your liver tissue is further organized into an organ, your liver.
Organs are formed from two or more specialized tissues working together to perform a job.
All organs, from your heart to your liver, are made up of an organized group of tissues.
These organs are part of a larger system, the organ systems .
For example, your brain works together with your spinal cord and other nerves to form the nervous system.
This organ system must be organized with other organ systems, such as the circulatory system and the digestive system, for your body to work.
Organ systems work together to form the entire organism.
There are many levels of organization in living things ( Figure below ).
Levels of organization in an organism
Levels of organization, from the atom (smallest) to the organism (largest).
Notice that organelles are inside a cell, and organs are inside an organism.
