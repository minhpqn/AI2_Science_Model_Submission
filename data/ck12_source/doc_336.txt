Conditions that irritate, clog or inflame your skin can cause symptoms such as redness, swelling, burning and itching.
Allergies, irritants, your genetic background and certain diseases and immune system problems can cause numerous skin conditions.
Many skin problems, such as acne, also affect your appearance.
Your skin has tiny holes called pores that that can become blocked by oil, bacteria, dead skin and dirt.
When this occurs, you may develop a pimple.
Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples, and is one of the more common skin problem among teenagers.
A diet high in refined sugars or carbohydrates such as bread and chips can also lead to acne.
Each pore on your skin is the opening to a follicle, which is made of a hair and sebaceous gland that releases sebum.
Acne may result from too much sebum produced by the follicle, dead skin cells accumulating in the pore, or bacteria built up in the pore.
Cleaning your skin daily with a mild soap to remove excess oil and dirt can help prevent acne.
Cold sores are red, fluid-filled blisters that appear near the mouth or on other areas of the face, usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 1.
Visible sores are contagious, but herpes may be spread even when sores can’t be seen.
You can catch the herpes simplex virus through kissing, sharing cosmetics, or sharing food with infected individuals.
Once you catch herpes simplex virus, it can’t be cured.
Even after sores have healed, the virus remains in your body, and new cold sores can appear at any time.
This is not to be confused with genital herpes, which is caused by herpes simplex virus type 2.
