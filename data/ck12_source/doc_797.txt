To grow and reproduce, organisms must get materials and energy from the environment.
Plants obtain their energy from the sun through photosynthesis , whereas animals obtain their energy from other organisms.
Either way, these plants and animals, as well as the bacteria and fungi, are constantly interacting with other species as well as the non-living parts of their ecosystem.
An organismâ€™s environment includes two types of factors:
Abiotic factors are the parts of the environment that are not living, such as sunlight, climate, soil, water, and air.
Biotic factors are the parts of the environment that are alive, or were alive and then died, such as plants, animals, and their remains.
Biotic factors also include bacteria, fungi and protists.
Ecology studies the interactions between biotic factors, such as organisms like plants and animals, and abiotic factors.
For example, all animals (biotic factors) breathe in oxygen (abiotic factor).
All plants (biotic factor) absorb carbon dioxide (abiotic factor) and need water (abiotic factor) to survive.
Can you think of another way that abiotic and biotic factors interact with each other?
Ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment.
Abiotic factors are the parts of the environment that have never been alive, while biotic factors are the parts of the environment that are alive, or were alive and then died.
