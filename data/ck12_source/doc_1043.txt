Since models are simpler than real objects or systems, they have limitations.
A model deals with only a portion of a system.
It may not predict the behavior of the real system very accurately.
But the more computing power that goes into the model and the care with which the scientists construct the model can increase the chances that a model will be accurate.
A model is a representation of a more complex system.
Models can be manipulated more easily than the system.
Models can be used to make predictions.
Models may be physical, conceptual, or mathematical.
