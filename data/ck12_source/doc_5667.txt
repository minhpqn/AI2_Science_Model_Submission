This is also unique for each element.
An atomâ€™s mass number is its mass in atomic mass units (amu), which is about equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom.
Different isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons.
Use the periodic table of the elements at the first URL below to fill in the blanks in the worksheet at the second URL.
What is the atomic number of an atom?
Why is this number important?
Describe the atomic mass unit.
What does it represent and what does it equal?
The symbol below represents an isotope of helium.
How many protons and neutrons does it have?
All carbon atoms have six protons.
Most also have six neutrons, but some have seven or eight neutrons.
What is the mass number of a carbon isotope that has seven neutrons?
Define mass number.
Calculate the mass number when given number of protons and neutrons.
Calculate number of neutrons when given atomic number.
An analytical scale is used to determine the mass of a chemical
How can you determine the mass of a chemical?
Often a student will need to weigh out a chemical for an experiment.
If he or she uses a watch glass (a small, round piece that will hold the solid chemical), the weight of the watch glass must be determined first.  Then the solid is added to the glass and the weight of the glass plus the solid is measured.  The balance reading will be the total of the glass plus the chemical.
