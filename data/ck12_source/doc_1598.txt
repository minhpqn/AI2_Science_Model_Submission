Cells were first observed under a light microscope, but today's electron microscopes allow scientists to take a closer look at the inside of cells.
Cell theory says that:
All organisms are composed of cells.
Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in all organisms.
All cells come from other cells.
Cells are organized into tissues, which are organized into organs, which are organized into organ systems, which are organized to create the whole organism.
