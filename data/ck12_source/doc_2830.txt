This means that the new element produced in the reaction has 82 protons.
You can find the element with this number of protons in the periodic table.
It is the element lead (Pb).
The new element also has 124 neutrons (206 – 82 protons = 124 neutrons).
How Dangerous Is Alpha Decay?
All types of radioactive decay pose risks to living things, but alpha decay is the least dangerous.
That’s because alpha particles are relatively heavy, so they can travel only a few centimeters through the air.
They also are not very penetrating.
For example, they can’t pass through a sheet of paper or thin layer of clothing.
They may burn the skin, but they can’t penetrate to the tissues underneath the skin.
However, if alpha particles are emitted inside the body, they can do more damage.
One way this can happen is by inhaling cigarette smoke.
People who smoke actually inhale the radioactive element polonium-210.
It undergoes alpha decay in the lungs.
Over time, exposure to alpha particles may cause lung cancer.
Alpha decay is one of three types of nuclear decay in which unstable nuclei emit energy with or without a particle of matter.
In alpha decay, energy and an alpha particle are emitted by a nucleus that is unstable because it has too many protons.
An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, so it is actually a helium nucleus.
Alpha decay is represented by a nuclear equation.
The equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons and neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow.
