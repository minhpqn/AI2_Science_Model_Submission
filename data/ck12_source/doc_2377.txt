It includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring device plus one estimated digit.
Look at the sketch of a beaker below.
How much blue liquid does the beaker contain?
The top of the liquid falls between the mark for 40 mL and 50 mL, but it’s closer to 50 mL.
A reasonable estimate is 47 mL.
In this measurement, the first digit (4) is known for certain and the second digit (7) is an estimate, so the measurement has two significant figures.
Now look at the graduated cylinder sketched below.
How much blue liquid does it contain?
First, it’s important to note that you should read the amount of liquid at the bottom of its curved surface.
This falls about half way between the mark for 36 mL and the mark for 37 mL, so a reasonable estimate would be 36.5 mL.
Q:
How many significant figures does this measurement have?
A:
There are three significant figures in this measurement.
You know that the first two digits (3 and 6) are accurate.
The third digit (5) is an estimate.
Rules for Counting Significant Figures
The examples above show that it’s easy to count the number of significant figures when you are making a measurement.
But what if someone else has made the measurement?
How do you know which digits are known for certain and which are estimated?
