RC Time Constant
Define the RC time constant and solve various problems involving resistor-capacitor circuits.
Students will learn about the RC time constant and how to solve various problems involving resistor-capacitor circuits.
Q(t) = Q_0 e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}} && \text{Discharge rate, where } \tau= RC
I(t) = I_0 e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}} && \text{Electric current flow varies with time in a like manner}
Guidance When a capacitor is initially uncharged, it is very easy to stuff charge in.
As charge builds, it repels new charge with more and more force.
Due to this effect, the charging of a capacitor follows a logarithmic curve.
When you pass current through a resistor into a capacitor, the capacitor eventually “fills up” and no more current flows.
A typical RC circuit is shown below; when the switch is closed, the capacitor discharges with an exponentially decreasing current.
In the circuit diagram shown above, the resistor has a value of 100\;\Omega and the capacitor has a capacitance of 500\;\mu\text{F} .
After the switched is closed, (a) how long will it be until the charge on the capacitor is only 10% of what it was when the switch was originally closed?
If the capacitor was originally charged by a 12 V battery, how much charge will be left on it at this time?
(a):
To solve the first part of the problem, we'll use the equation that gives charge as a function of time.
