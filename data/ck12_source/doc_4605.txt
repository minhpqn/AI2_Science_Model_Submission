B Cell Activation
B cells must be activated by an antigen before they can fight pathogens.
This happens in the sequence of events shown in Figure below .
First, a B cell encounters its matching antigen and engulfs it.
The B cell then displays fragments of the antigen on its surface.
This attracts a helper T cell .
The helper T cell binds to the B cell at the antigen site and releases cytokines that “tell” or signal the B cell to develop into a plasma cell .
B lymphocytes are further discussed at

Activation of a B cell
Activation of a B cell must occur before it can respond to pathogens.
What role do T cells play in the activation process?
Plasma Cells and Antibody Production
Plasma cells are activated B cells that secrete antibodies.
Antibodies are large, Y-shaped proteins that recognize and bind to antigens.
Plasma cells are like antibody factories, producing many copies of a single type of antibody.
The antibodies travel throughout the body in blood and lymph.
Each antibody binds to just one kind of antigen.
When it does, it forms an antigen-antibody complex (see Figure below ).
