Formation of Cell Layers
During the second week after fertilization, cells in the embryo migrate to form three distinct cell layers, called the ectoderm, mesoderm , and endoderm .
Each layer will soon develop into different types of cells and tissues, as shown in Figure below .
Embryonic cell layers
Cell Layers of the Embryo.
The migration of cells into three layers occurs in the 2-week-old embryo.
What organs eventually develop from the ectoderm cell layer?
Which cell layer develops into muscle tissues?
Differentiation of Cells
A zygote is a single cell.
How does a single cell develop into many different types of cells?
During the third week after fertilization, the embryo begins to undergo cellular differentiation.
Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized.
As illustrated in Figure below , differentiation occurs as certain genes are expressed ("switched on") while other genes are switched off.
Because of this process, cells develop unique structures and abilities that suit them for their specialized functions.
You can explore cell differentiation by watching the video at this link:
Embryonic cell differentiation: week 3.
Cellular differentiation occurs in the 3-week-old embryo.
After cells differentiate, all the major organs begin to form during the remaining weeks of embryonic development.
