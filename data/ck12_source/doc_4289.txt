With over 80,000 species, there are plenty of different types of roundworms.
But these are still not the types of worms most people picture when they think of worms.
Roundworms make up the phylum Nematoda .
This is a very diverse animal phyla.
It has more than 80,000 known species.
Structure and Function of Roundworms
Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters (23 feet) in length.
As their name suggests, they have a round body.
This is because they have a pseudocoelom .
This is one way they differ from flatworms.
Another way is their complete digestive system.
It allows them to take in food, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time.
Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body.
It prevents their body from expanding.
This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in the pseudocoelom.
As a result, roundworms have a hydrostatic skeleton.
This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles lining the pseudocoelom.
This allows the worms to move efficiently along solid surfaces.
Roundworms reproduce sexually.
Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults.
