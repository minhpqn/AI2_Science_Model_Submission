The carbonate ion (CO 3 2- ) is a carbon atom (black) bonded to three oxygen atoms.
The Table below lists a number of polyatomic ions by name and by structure.
The heading for each column indicates the charge on the polyatomic ions in that group.
Note that the vast majority of the ions listed are anions – there are very few polyatomic cations.

The vast majority of polyatomic ions are anions, many of which end in –ate or –ite .
Notice that in some cases such as nitrate (NO 3 - ) and nitrite (NO 2 - ), there are multiple anions that consist of the same two elements.
In these cases, the difference between the ions is in the number of oxygen atoms present, while the overall charge is the same.
As a class, these are called oxoanions.
When there are two oxoanions for a particular element, the one with the greater number of oxygen atoms gets the –ate suffix, while the one with the fewer number of oxygen atoms gets the –ite suffix.
The four oxoanions of chlorine are shown below.
ClO - , hypochlorite
ClO 2 - , chlorite
ClO 3 - , chlorate
ClO 4 - , perchlorate
In cases such as this, the ion with one more oxygen atom than the –ate anion is given a per- prefix.
The ion with one fewer oxygen atom than the –ite anion is given a hypo- prefix.
Polyatomic ions contain more than one type of atom in the ion.
The majority of polyatomic ions are anions that are named ending in “ate” or “ite.”
