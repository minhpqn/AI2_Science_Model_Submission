Explain the importance of independent assortment and random fertilization.
What helps ensure the survival of a species?
Genetic variation.
It is this variation that is the essence of evolution.
Without genetic differences among individuals, "survival of the fittest" would not be likely.
Either all survive, or all perish.
Sexual reproduction results in infinite possibilities of genetic variation.
In other words, sexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically unique.
They differ from both parents and also from each other.
This occurs for a number of reasons.
When homologous chromosomes form pairs during prophase I of meiosis I, crossing-over can occur.
Crossing-over is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes.
It results in new combinations of genes on each chromosome.
When cells divide during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly distributed to daughter cells, and different chromosomes segregate independently of each other.
This called is called independent assortment .
It results in gametes that have unique combinations of chromosomes.
In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring.
But which two of the millions of possible gametes will it be?
This is likely to be a matter of chance.
It is obviously another source of genetic variation in offspring.
