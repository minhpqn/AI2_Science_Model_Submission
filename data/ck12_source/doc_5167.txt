reproduction :
Process by which living organisms give rise to offspring; making the next generation.
sexual reproduction :
Reproduction involving the joining of haploid gametes, producing genetically diverse individuals.
spore :
A haploid reproductive cell, found in plants, algae and some protists; can fully develop without fusing with another cell.
vegetative reproduction :
A type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores.
zygote :
A fertilized egg; the first cell of a new organism.
Asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent.
Numerous types of asexual reproduction exist, including fission, fragmentation and budding.
Bacteria and single-celled eukaryotic organisms must reproduce asexually, however, numerous multi celled organisms also reproduce asexually.
What is reproduction?
Describe three types of asexual reproduction?
