This independent assortment, in which the chromosome inherited from either the father or mother can sort into any gamete, produces the potential for tremendous genetic variation.
Together with random fertilization, more possibilities for genetic variation exist between any two people than the number of individuals alive today.
Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male.
In humans, over 8 million (2 23 ) chromosome combinations exist in the production of gametes in both the male and female.
A sperm cell, with over 8 million chromosome combinations, fertilizes an egg cell, which also has over 8 million chromosome combinations.
That is over 64 trillion unique combinations, not counting the unique combinations produced by crossing-over.
In other words, each human couple could produce a child with over 64 trillion unique chromosome combinations!

Sexual reproduction has the potential to produce tremendous genetic variation in offspring.
This variation is due to independent assortment and crossing-over during meiosis, and random union of gametes during fertilization.
