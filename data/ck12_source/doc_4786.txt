A water molecule forms when oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) atoms react and are held together by covalent bonds.
Like other compounds, water always has the same chemical composition: a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms.
This is expressed in the chemical formula H 2 O.
A model of a water molecule is shown in Figure below .
Model of a water molecule, showing the arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
The protons (8 in oxygen, 1 in hydrogen) and neutrons (8 in oxygen) are depicted in the nucleus.
Compounds that contain mainly the elements carbon and hydrogen are called organic compounds .
This is because they are found mainly in living organisms.
Most organic compounds are held together by covalent bonds.
An example of an organic compound is glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), which is shown in Figure below .
Glucose is a simple sugar that living cells use for energy.
All other compounds are called inorganic compounds.
Water is an example of an inorganic compound.

Glucose Molecule.
This model represents a molecule of glucose, an organic compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
The chemical formula for glucose is C 6 H 12 O 6 .
This means that each molecule of glucose contains six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms.
