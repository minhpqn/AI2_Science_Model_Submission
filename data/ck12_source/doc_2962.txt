Velocity is a vector.
A vector is measurement that includes both size and direction.
Vectors are often represented by arrows.
When using an arrow to represent velocity, the length of the arrow stands for speed, and the way the arrow points indicates the direction.
If youâ€™re still not sure of the difference between speed and velocity, watch the cartoon at this URL:

Using Vector Arrows to Represent Velocity
The arrows in the Figure below represent the velocity of three different objects.
Arrows A and B are the same length but point in different directions.
They represent objects moving at the same speed but in different directions.
Arrow C is shorter than arrow A or B but points in the same direction as arrow A.
It represents an object moving at a slower speed than A or B but in the same direction as A.
These objects are moving at different speed and in different directions
Differences in Velocity
Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same speed and in the same direction.
Objects moving at different speeds, in different directions, or both have different velocities.
Look again at arrows A and B from the Figure above .
They represent objects that have different velocities only because they are moving in different directions.
A and C represent objects that have different velocities only because they are moving at different speeds.
Objects represented by B and C have different velocities because they are moving in different directions and at different speeds.
