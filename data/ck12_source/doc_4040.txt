For example:
Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA that is different from the DNA found in the cell nucleus.
Instead, it is similar to the circular DNA of bacteria.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts are surrounded by their own plasma membranes, which are similar to bacterial membranes.
New mitochondria and chloroplasts are produced through a process similar to binary fission .
Bacteria also reproduce through binary fission.
The internal structure and biochemistry of chloroplasts is very similar to that of cyanobacteria.
Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes.
Protists most likely evolved from prokaryotic cells, as explained by the endosymbiotic theory.
This theory is well-supported by evidence.
