Discuss common misconceptions of evolution.
What is a dinosaur?
A dinosaur is from a class of reptiles.
They are diverse reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic period, approximately 230 million years ago, and were the dominant land vertebrates for 135 million years, from the beginning of the Jurassic period (about 200 million years ago) until they went extinct, at the end of the Cretaceous period, 65.5 million years ago.
They are very strong evidence of evolution, the change in species over time.
Dinosaurs went extinct because they could not adapt to a catastrophic environmental change.
The ability to adapt to a changing environment is a key feature of natural selection, the process of evolution.
Evolution of Life
Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over time.
It is a process that began on this planet well over 3.5 billion years ago and continues to this day, as populations of organisms continue to change.
Evolution occurs as organisms acquire and pass on new traits from one generation to the next generation.
Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new species and the great diversity of the biological world.
Extant species are related to each other through common descent, and products of evolution over billions of years.
Analysis of the DNA of different organisms indicates there is a similarity among very different organisms in the genetic code that help make proteins and other molecules.
This genetic code is used by all known forms of life on Earth.
The theory of evolution suggests that the genetic code was established very early in the history of life, and some studies suggest it was established soon after the formation of Earth.
