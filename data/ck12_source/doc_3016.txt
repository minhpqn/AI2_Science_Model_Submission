It is defined as the force needed to cause a 1-kilogram mass to accelerate at 1 m/s 2 .
Therefore, force can also be expressed in the unit kg • m/s 2 .
This way of expressing force can be substituted for Newtons in Xander’s acceleration so the answer is expressed in the SI unit for acceleration, which is m/s 2 :
\text{a}=\frac{0.5 \ \text{N}}{\text{kg}}=\frac{0.5 \ \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}^2}{\text{kg}}=0.5 \ \text{m/s}^2
Q :
Why are there no kilograms in the final answer to this problem?
A :
The kilogram units in the numerator and denominator of the fraction cancel out.
As a result, the answer is expressed in the correct SI units for acceleration.
It’s often easier to measure the mass and acceleration of an object than the net force acting on it.
Mass can be measured with a balance, and average acceleration can be calculated from velocity and time.
However, net force may be a combination of many unseen forces, such as gravity, friction with surfaces, and air resistance.
Therefore, it may be more useful to know how to calculate the net force acting on an object from its mass and acceleration.
The equation for acceleration above can be rewritten to solve for net force as:
Net Force = Mass × Acceleration, or
F = m × a
Look at Xander in the Figure below .
He’s riding his scooter down a ramp.
Assume that his acceleration is 0.8 m/s 2 .
How much force does it take for him to accelerate at this rate?
