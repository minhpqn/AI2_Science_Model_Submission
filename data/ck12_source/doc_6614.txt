Treating Cancer with Chemistry
Cancer treatment is a complex and challenging effort.
Cancer cells grow without the usual controls that act on normal cells .
One approach to treating cancer is to alter the structure of the DNA in order to slow down or stop the growth of the abnormal cells.
Compounds that structurally resemble the normal building blocks of DNA have been shown to be very effective in stopping some forms of cancer from spreading throughout the body.
The Swiss biochemist Friedrich Miescher first discovered nitrogen-containing compounds in the nuclei of cells in 1869.
The term nucleic acid was used to describe these molecules because of their discovery within the cell nucleus and because of the presence of phosphate groups and their relationship to phosphoric acid.
A nucleic acid is a large biopolymer consisting of many nucleotides.
The two primary nucleic acids which are found in cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).
DNA is the carrier of genetic information and is ultimately responsible for how cells produce proteins in order to carry out all the functions necessary for life.
