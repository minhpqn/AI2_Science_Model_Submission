Give examples of scientific theories.
Explain and describe a superseded theory.
Compare scientific theories to scientific laws.
Theory vs. theory.
Is a scientific theory different from the everyday use of the word theory?
The Big Bang Theory.
The Theory of Gravity.
The Plate Tectonic Theory.
The Modern Atomic Theory.
The Cell Theory.
The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.
These are all classic scientific theories.
So, without a doubt, yes, a scientific theory is very different from the everyday use of the word theory.
A scientific theory is accepted as a scientific truth, supported by evidence collected by many scientists.
Lots of data has been collected to support theories, and no data has been identified to prove theories incorrect.
That does not necessarily mean that evidence does not exist against a theory does not exist, it simply means that evidence has yet to be identified.
Scientific theories are hypotheses which have stood up to repeated attempts at falsification and are thus supported by a great deal of data and evidence.
Some well known biological theories include the theory of evolution by natural selection, the cell theory (the idea that all organisms are made of cells), and the germ theory of disease (the idea that certain microbes cause certain diseases).
The scientific community holds that a greater amount of evidence supports these ideas than contradicts them, and so they are referred to as theories.
In fact, no evidence has been identified to disprove these or other scientific theories.
