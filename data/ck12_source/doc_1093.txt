Gravity corers are metal tubes that fall to the seafloor.
They slice into the sediments to collect a sample.
The research vessel, the Joides Resolution , drills deep into the seafloor to collect samples of the sediment and ocean crust.
Scientists analyze the samples for chemistry and their magnetic properties.
Samples of seawater and rocks can be collected directly by scientists in a submersible .
These subs can take scientists down to make observations.
The subs have arms for collecting samples.
The human operated vehicle, Alvin can dive up to 4,500 meters beneath the ocean surface and has made more than 4,600 dives since 1964 ( Figure below
The Alvin submersible
Alvin allows two people and a pilot to make a nine hour dive.
Remotely Operated Vehicles
Sending humans to the seafloor is expensive and dangerous.
Having to return humans safely to the surface limits what a mission can do.
Remotely operated vehicles , or ROVs, allow scientists to study the deep without going to the seafloor.
These small vehicles carry cameras and scientific instruments.
ROVs were used to study inside the Titanic .
This would have been far too dangerous for a manned sub to enter.
Scientists control ROVs electronically with sophisticated operating systems.
Footage of the NOAA Titanic Expedition of 2004 is visible in this video:  .
Scientists have developed amazing technologies so that they can understand the oceans.
