Q :
If the pulley only changes the direction of the force, how does it make the work of raising the flag easier?
A :
The pulley makes it easier to lift the flag because it allows a person to pull down on the rope and add his or her own weight to the effort, rather than simply lifting the load.
Simple and Compound Machines
There are six types of simple machines that are the basis of all other machines.
They are the inclined plane, lever, wedge, screw, pulley, and wheel and axle.
The six types are pictured in the Figure below .
Youâ€™ve probably used some of these simple machines yourself.
Most machines are combinations of two or more simple machines.
These machines are called compound machines.
An example of a compound machine is a wheelbarrow (see bottom of Figure below ).
It consists of two simple machines: a lever and a wheel and axle.
Many compound machines are much more complex and consist of many simple machines.
Examples include washing machines and cars.

A machine is any device that makes work easier by changing a force.
Machines may increase the strength of the force, increase the distance over which the force is applied, or change the direction in which the force is applied.
