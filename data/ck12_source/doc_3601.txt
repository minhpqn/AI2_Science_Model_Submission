They include DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and finally the separation into two daughter cells.
Step 1:
DNA Replication.
Just before the cell divides, its DNA is copied in a process called DNA replication.
This results in two identical chromosomes instead of just one.
This step is necessary so that when the cell divides, each daughter cell will have its own chromosome.
Step 2:
Chromosome Segregation.
The two chromosomes segregate, or separate, and move to opposite ends (known as "poles") of the cell.
This occurs as each copy of DNA attaches to different parts of the cell membrane.
Step 3:
Separation.
A new plasma membrane starts growing into the center of the cell, and the cytoplasm splits apart, forming two daughter cells.
As the cell begins to pull apart, the new and the original chromosomes are separated.
The two daughter cells that result are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.
New cell wall must also form around the two cells.
Steps of Binary Fission
Steps of Binary Fission.
Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission.
This is also how many single-celled organisms reproduce.
