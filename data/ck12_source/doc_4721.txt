Distinguish between a scientific theory and a scientific law.
Give examples of scientific theory from a variety of scientific fields.

Outline the importance of scientific models.
Describe factors important in evaluating models.
List common model organisms.
What is a scientific model?
Looks like a human head, but it is obviously missing certain parts.
Of course, this would be a model, and it could be considered a scientific model as it represents the anatomy of the head and skull.
It can be used to teach about this anatomy.
To describe particular parts of a phenomenon, or the interactions among a set of phenomena, it is sometimes helpful to develop a model of the phenomenon.
Scientific models are representations of reality.
They can be a physical, mathematical, or logical representations of a system, phenomenon, or process, and they allow scientists to investigate a phenomenon in a controlled way.
For instance, a scale model of a house or of a solar system is clearly not an actual house or an actual solar system.
The parts of an actual house or an actual solar system represented by a scale model are, only in limited ways, representative of the actual objects ( Figure below ).
A model of planets of the solar system.
This model is clearly not a real solar system; it is a representation of the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.
Scientists use representations of natural things to learn more about them.
Also, the visitors to the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California can get a better idea of the relative sizes of the planets by observing this model.
Scientific modeling is the process of making abstract models of natural phenomena.
