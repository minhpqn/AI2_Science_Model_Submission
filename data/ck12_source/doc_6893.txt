The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object.
The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion but is constant in SHM.
The amplitude of a wave often determines its strength or intensity; the exact meaning of "strength" depends on the type of wave.
For example, a sound wave with a large amplitude is a loud sound and a light wave with a large amplitude is very bright.
A medium is the substance through which the wave travels.
For example, water acts as the medium for ocean waves, while air molecules act as the medium for sound waves.
When a wave passes through a medium, the medium is only temporarily disturbed.
When an ocean wave travels from one side of the Mediterranean Sea to the other, no actual water molecules move this great distance.
Only the disturbance propagates (moves) through the medium.
An object oscillating with frequency f will create waves which oscillate with the same frequency f .
The speed v and wavelength \lambda of a wave depend on the nature of the medium through which the wave travels.
There are two main types of waves we will consider: longitudinal and transverse waves.
In longitudinal waves, the vibrations of the medium are in the same direction as the wave motion.
A classic example is a wave traveling down a line of standing dominoes: each domino will fall in the same direction as the motion of the wave.
A more physical example is a sound wave.
For sound waves, high and low pressure zones move both forward and backward as the wave moves through them.
In transverse waves, the vibrations of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of motion.
A classic example is a wave created in a long rope: the wave travels from one end of the rope to the other, but the actual rope moves up and down, and not from left to right as the wave does.
Water waves act as a mix of longitudinal and transverse waves.
A typical water molecule pretty much moves in a circle when a wave passes through it.
