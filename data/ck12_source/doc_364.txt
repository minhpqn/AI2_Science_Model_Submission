Pictured below are some foods that are good sources of carbohydrates ( Figure below ).
Until the age of 13, you need about 130 grams of preferably complex carbohydrates a day
Up to the age of 13 years, you need about 130 grams of carbohydrates a day.
Most of the carbohydrates should be complex.
They are broken down by the body more slowly than simple carbohydrates.
Therefore, they provide energy longer and more steadily.
Sugars are small, simple carbohydrates that are found in foods such as fruits and milk.
The sugar found in fruits is called fructose.
The sugar found in milk is called lactose.
These sugars are broken down by the body to form glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), the simplest sugar of all.
Where does glucose come from?
Recall that glucose is the product of photosynthesis, so some organisms such as plants are able to make their own glucose.
As animals cannot photosynthesize, they must eat to obtain carbohydrates.
Through the process of cellular respiration , glucose is converted by cells into energy that is usable by the cell (ATP).
Starch is a large, complex carbohydrate made of thousands of glucose units (monomers) joined together.
Starches are found in foods such as vegetables and grains.
Starches are broken down by the body into sugars that provide energy.
Breads and pasta are good sources of complex carbohydrates.
Fiber is another type of large, complex carbohydrate that is partly indigestible.
Unlike sugars and starches, fiber does not provide energy.
