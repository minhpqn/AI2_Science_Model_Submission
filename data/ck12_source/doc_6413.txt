An ICE table is set up in order to determine the concentrations of HCOOH and HCOO - at equilibrium.
All concentrations are then substituted into the  K_a expression and the  K_a value is calculated.
Step 2:
Solve.
[\text{H}^+]=10^{-\text{pH}}=10^{-2.04}=9.12 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{M}
Since each formic acid molecule that ionizes yields one H + ion and one formate ion (HCOO - ), the concentrations of H + and HCOO - are equal at equilibrium.
We assume that the initial concentrations of each ion are zero, resulting in the following ICE table.
[H + ]
[HCOO − ]
Now substituting into the  K_a expression gives:
K_a=\frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{HCOO}^-]}{[\text{HCOOH}]}=\frac{(9.12 \times 10^{-3})(9.12 \times 10^{-3})}{0.491}=1.7 \times 10^{-4}
Step 3:
Think about your result .
The value of  K_a is consistent with that of a weak acid.
Two significant figures are appropriate for the answer, since there are two digits after the decimal point in the reported pH.
Similar steps can be taken to determine the  K_b of a base.
For example, a 0.750 M solution of the weak base ethylamine (C 2 H 5 NH 2 ) has a pH of 12.31.
\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2+ \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftarrows \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}^+_3 + \text{OH}^-
Since one of the products of the ionization reaction is the hydroxide ion, we need to first find the [OH − ] at equilibrium.
The pOH is 14 - 12.31 = 1.69.
