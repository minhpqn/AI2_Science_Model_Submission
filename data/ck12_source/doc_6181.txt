The chemical nature of the solute is not important because the vapor pressure is merely a physical property of the solvent.
The only requirement is that the solute only dissolved and does not undergo a chemical reaction with the solvent.
While the chemical nature of the solute is not a factor, it is necessary to take into account whether the solute is an electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte.
Recall that ionic compounds are strong electrolytes and thus dissociate into ions when they dissolve.
This results in a larger number of dissolved particles.
For example, consider two different solutions of equal concentration.
One is made from the ionic compound sodium chloride, while the other is made from the molecular compound glucose.
The following equations show what happens when these solutes dissolve.
& \text{NaCl}(s) \rightarrow \text{Na}^+(aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq) && 2 \ \text{dissolved particles}\\& \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6(s) \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6(aq) && 1 \ \text{dissolved particle}
The sodium chloride dissociates into two ions, while the glucose does not dissociate.
Therefore, equal concentrations of each solution will result in twice as many dissolved particles in the case of the sodium chloride.
The vapor pressure of the sodium chloride solution will be lowered twice the amount as the glucose solution.
Addition of a nonvolatile solute to a solution lowers the vapor pressure of the solution.
