These are the same muscles used for running, so lizards have to hold their breath when they run.
Crocodiles and alligators have a large sheet of muscle below the lungs, called a diaphragm, that controls their breathing.
This is a structure that is also found in mammals.
Ectothermy in Reptiles
Like amphibians, reptiles are ectotherms with a slow metabolic rate.
Their metabolism doesn’t generate enough energy to keep their body temperature stable.
Instead, reptiles regulate their body temperature through their behavior.
For example, the crocodile in Figure below is soaking up heat from the environment by basking in the sun.
Because of their ectothermy, reptiles can get by with as little as one tenth the food needed by endotherms such as mammals.
Some species of reptiles can go several weeks between meals.

This crocodile is being warmed by the environment in three ways.
Heat is radiating directly from the sun to the animal’s back.
Heat is also being conducted to the animal from the rocks it rests on.
In addition, convection currents are carrying warm air from surrounding rocks to the animal’s body.
Other Reptile Structures
Like amphibians, most reptiles have a heart with three chambers, although crocodiles and alligators have a four-chambered heart like birds and mammals.
The reptile brain is also similar in size to the amphibian brain, taking into account overall body size.
However, the parts of the reptile brain that control the senses and learned behavior are larger than in amphibians.
