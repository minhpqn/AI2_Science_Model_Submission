Distinguish allopatric speciation from sympatric speciation.
Where did this diversity of life come from?
If you have ever been to the beach, then you realize there is not just one species of marine life.
The wide variety of shells that wash up on the beach indicate that there are many forms of life in the ocean.
This wide diversity of life requires that many new species have appeared over time.
But how does a new species come into being?
The Origin of Species
The creation of a new species is called speciation .
Most new species develop naturally.
But humans have also artificially created new breeds and species for thousands of years.
New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection .
Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers.
Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.
For example, a giraffeâ€™s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees.
Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.
As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a population's gene pool (changing the population's allele frequencies), some of these changes will be beneficial and result in traits that allow adaptation and survival.
Natural selection causes evolution of a species as these beneficial traits become more common within a population.
Artificial selection occurs when humans select which plants or animals to breed in order to pass on specific traits to the next generation.
For example, a farmer may choose to breed only cows that produce the best milk.
Farmers would also avoid breeding cows that produce less milk.
