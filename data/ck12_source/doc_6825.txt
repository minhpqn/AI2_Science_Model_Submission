Features of Roundworms
Unlike the flatworms, the roundworms have a body cavity with internal organs.
A roundworm has a complete digestive system, which includes both a mouth and an anus.
This is a significant difference from the incomplete digestive system of flatworms.
The roundworm digestive system also include a large digestive organ known as the gut.
Digestive enzymes that start to break down food are produced here.
There is no stomach, but there is an intestine which produces enzymes that help absorb nutrients.
The last portion of the intestine forms a rectum, which expels waste through the anus.
Roundworms also have a simple nervous system with a primitive brain.
There are four nerves that run the length of the body and are connected from the top to the bottom of the body.
At the anterior end of the animal (the head region), the nerves branch from a circular ring which serves as the brain.
The head of a nematode has a few tiny sense organs, including chemoreceptors, which sense chemicals.
Though still a relatively simple structure, the nervous system of roundworms is very different from that of the cnidarian nerve net.
Roundworms in the Environment
Roundworms can be free-living organisms, but they are probably best known for their role as significant plant and animal parasites.
Most Nematodes are parasitic, with over 16,000 parasitic species described.
Heartworms, which cause serious disease in dogs while living in the heart and blood vessels, are a type of roundworm.
Roundworms can also cause disease in humans.
Elephantiasis, a disease characterized by the extreme swelling of the limbs ( Figure below ), is caused by infection with a type of roundworm.
