A refrigerant is a substance such as Freon™ that has a low boiling point and changes between liquid and gaseous states as it passes through the refrigerator.
As a liquid, the refrigerant absorbs thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator and changes to a gas.
As a gas, it transfers thermal energy to the warm air outside the refrigerator and changes back to a liquid.
Work is done by a refrigerator to move the refrigerant through the different components of the refrigerator.

The purpose of a cooling system such as a refrigerator or air conditioner is to transfer thermal energy in order to keep things cool.
A refrigerator transfers thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen.
Thermal energy normally moves from a warmer area to a cooler area, so a refrigerator must do work to reverse the normal direction of heat flow.
The key to how a refrigerator or other cooling system works is the refrigerant.
A refrigerant is a substance with a low boiling point that changes between liquid and gaseous states as it passes through the refrigerator.
