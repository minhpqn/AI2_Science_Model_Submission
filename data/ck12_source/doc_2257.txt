Betelgeuse is a giant red supergiant
The red star Betelgeuse in Orion is a red supergiant.
In a red supergiant, fusion does not stop.
Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms.
Eventually iron atoms form.
When there is nothing left to fuse, the star’s iron core explodes violently.
This is called a supernova explosion.
The incredible energy released fuses heavy atoms together.
The elements heavier than iron form in supernova explosions, including gold, silver, and uranium.
A supernova can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy, but only for a short time, as illustrated below ( Figure below ).
(a) NASA’s Chandra X-ray observatory captured the brightest stellar explosion so far, 100 times more energetic than a typical supernova. (b) This false-color image of the supernova remnant SN 1604 was observed as a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy.
At its peak, it was brighter than all other stars and planets, except Venus, in the night sky.
The Importance of Supernovae
All chemical elements except hydrogen, helium, and lithium were created in stars.
These chemical elements are found in our solar system and on Earth because of supernova explosions.
This is what people mean when they say that we are all made of stardust.
When a massive star has no more elements left to fuse, it explodes as a supernova.
Chemical elements heavier than lithium form in a supernova.
A supernova explosion spreads the elements into nearby space.
This is the source of most of our elements.
