Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current.
Current flowing through a wire creates a magnetic field that surrounds the wire in concentric circles.
When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current flowing through a wire, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.
Electromagnetism is very useful because it can be turned on or off by turning the current on or off, and it can be made stronger or weaker by using more or less current.

Apply the right hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field around the wire shown below.
The arrow inside the wire shows the direction of electric current flowing through the wire.
Add more arrows to the sketch to show the direction of the magnetic field.
Why is electromagnetism more useful than regular magnetism?
Discovery of Electromagnetism
Describe the accidental discovery of electromagnetism.
Explain how Oersted found the direction of the magnetic field around a wire carrying current.
State Faraday’s law.
Tamara made the simple device in this picture for science class.
She wrapped a wire around a nail and connected the ends of the wire to the terminals of a battery.
The nail is attracting paper clips, so it appears to have become magnetized.
The device isn’t complicated, but it shows a very important relationship.
