Food and Nutrients
Did you ever hear the saying, “You are what you eat”?
It’s not just a saying.
It’s actually true.
What you eat plays an important role in your health.
Eating a variety of the right types of foods promotes good health and provides energy for growth and activity.
This is because healthful foods are rich in nutrients.
Nutrients are substances the body needs for energy, building materials, and control of body processes.
There are six main classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, vitamins, and minerals.
These six classes are categorized as macronutrients or micronutrients depending on how much of them the body needs.
Nutrients the body needs in relatively large amounts are called macronutrients .
They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water.
All macronutrients except water can be used by the body for energy. (The energy in food is measured in a unit called a Calorie .) The exact amount of each macronutrient that an individual needs depends on many factors, including gender and age.
