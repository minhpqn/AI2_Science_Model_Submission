Oxygen Enters the Atmosphere
Early cells took nutrients from the water.
Eventually the nutrients would have become less abundant.
Around 3 billion years ago, photosynthesis began.
Organisms could make their own food from sunlight and inorganic molecules.
From these ingredients they made chemical energy that they used.
Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis.
That first oxygen combined with iron to create iron oxide.
As more oxygen was produced, the gas entered the atmosphere.
Some of the oxygen in the atmosphere became ozone.
The ozone layer formed to protect Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
This made the environment able to support more complex life forms.
The first organisms to photosynthesize were cyanobacteria .
These organisms may have been around as far back as 3.5 billion years.
Cyanobacteria are still alive today ( Figure below ).
Now they are called blue-green algae.
They are common in lakes and seas, and they account for 20% to 30% of photosynthesis today.
