b. 1 second c. at 2 seconds d. 4 m
a. 250 m b. 13 m/s, -13 m/s c. 14 s for round trip
Let’s say we can jump 20 feet (6.1 m) in the air. ☺ Then, on the moon, we can jump 36.5 m straight up.
23 m/s b. 3.6 seconds c. 28 m d. 45 m
25 m/s b. 30 m c. 2.5 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2
a. v_0 = 0 b. 10 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 c. - 10 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 d. 60 m
In these lessons students will learn the fundamentals of motion in one dimension, graphing position, velocity and acceleration vs time and using the kinematic equations to solve problems.
