The trick is to get the marshmallow a nice golden brown without catching it on fire.
Too often we are not successful and we see the marshmallow burning on the stick â€“ a combustion reaction taking place right in front of us.
A combustion reaction is a reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen gas, releasing energy in the form of light and heat.
Combustion reactions must involve O 2 as one reactant.
The combustion of hydrogen gas produces water vapor.
2\text{H}_2 (g)+\text{O}_2 (g) \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
Notice that this reaction also qualifies as a combination reaction.
The explosion of the Hindenburg was a combustion reaction
Explosion of the Hindenberg.
The Hindenburg was a hydrogen-filled airship that suffered an accident upon its attempted landing in New Jersey in 1937.
The hydrogen immediately combusted in a huge fireball, destroying the airship and killing 36 people.
The chemical reaction was a simple one: hydrogen combining with oxygen to produce water.
Many combustion reactions occur with a hydrocarbon, a compound made up solely of carbon and hydrogen.
The products of the combustion of hydrocarbons are carbon dioxide and water.
Many hydrocarbons are used as fuel because their combustion releases very large amounts of heat energy.
Propane (C 3 H 8 ) is a gaseous hydrocarbon that is commonly used as the fuel source in gas grills.
\text{C}_3\text{H}_8(g)+5\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_2(g)+4\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
