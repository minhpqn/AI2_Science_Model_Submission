They are waiting for their chance to grow.
Just like primary succession, the burned forest will go through a series of communities, starting with small grasses, then shrubs, and finally bigger trees.
After a forest fire, a habitat slowly goes through secondary succession
The early stages of succession after a forest fire are shown in these pictures.
Taken four years after the fire, they show the charred remains of the original forest as well as the small grasses and shrubs that are beginning to grow back in the area.
The burnt forest here was slowly replaced by small grasses that are now being replaced by small trees and shrubs
In 1988, a forest fire destroyed much of Yellowstone National Park.
This photo, taken 17 years later, shows that the forest is gradually growing back.
Small grasses first grew here and are now being replaced by small trees and shrubs.
This is an example of the later stages of secondary succession.
A climax community ( Figure below ) is the end result of ecological succession.
The climax community is a stable balance of all organisms in an ecosystem, and will remain stable unless a disaster strikes.
After the disaster, succession will start all over again.
Depending on the climate of the area, the climax community will look different.
In the tropics, the climax community might be a tropical rainforest.
At the other extreme, in northern parts of the world, the climax community might be a coniferous forest.
Though climax communities are stable, are they truly the final community of the habitat?
Or is it likely that sometime in the future, maybe a long time in the future, the community of populations will change, and another stable, climax community will thrive?
These redwood trees are part of a climax community, the end result of a series of successions
These ancient redwood trees are part of a climax community, the end result of a series of community replacements during succession.
