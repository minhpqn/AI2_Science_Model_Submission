Motion of particles causes evaporation
Factors That Affect the Rate of Evaporation
Many factors influence how quickly a liquid evaporates.
They include:
temperature of the liquid.
A cup of hot water will evaporate more quickly than a cup of cold water.
exposed surface area of the liquid.
The same amount of water will evaporate more quickly in a wide shallow bowl than in a tall narrow glass.
presence or absence of other substances in the liquid.
Pure water will evaporate more quickly than salt water.
air movement.
Clothes on a clothesline will dry more quickly on a windy day than on a still day.
concentration of the evaporating substance in the air.
Clothes will dry more quickly when air contains little water vapor.
With the interactive animation at the URL below, you can explore how three of these factors affect the rate of evaporation of water.
Did you ever notice that moving air cools you down when you’re hot and sweaty?
For example, if you sit in front of a fan, you feel cooler.
That’s because moving air helps to evaporate the sweat on your skin.
But why does the evaporation of sweat cool you down?
When a liquid such as sweat evaporates, energetic particles on the surface of the liquid escape into the air.
