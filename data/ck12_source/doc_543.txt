Getting plenty of exercise, avoiding high-fat foods, and staying at a healthy weight can reduce the risk of developing this type of diabetes.
This is especially important for people who have family members with the disease.
Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer.
In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer.
For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking.
You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen.
How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ).
Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan.
This is a myth.
Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation.
Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer.
It doesnâ€™t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun.
Overall, people in many developed countries are contributing to higher rates of noninfectious diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer) by taking advantage of technology and social environments that encourage a less active lifestyle, and also encourages faster and cheaper meals.
For example, many children now spend more time on their computer or watching TV then playing outdoors.
The "faster and cheaper" meals are usually less healthy than other meals.
Even though many people are living longer, they can choose to live more healthily by adopting regular exercise routines and healthy eating habits.
It is important to select a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and protects against both UVA and UVB radiation
When you choose a sunscreen, select one with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or higher.
Also, choose a sunscreen that protects against both UVB and UVA radiation.
A healthy lifestyle can help reduce your risk of developing many noninfectious diseases.
