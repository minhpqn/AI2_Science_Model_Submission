Resistors in Series
Analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in series.
Students will learn how to analyze and solve problems involving circuits with resistors in series.
R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots
Resistors in Series:
All resistors are connected end to end.
There is only one river, so they all receive the same current.
But since there is a voltage drop across each resistor, they may all have different voltages across them.
The more resistors in series the more rocks in the river, so the less current that flows.
A circuit is wired up with two resistors in series.
Both resistors are in the same ‘river’, so both have the same current flowing through them.
Neither resistor has a direct connection to the power supply so neither has 20V across it.
But the combined voltages across the individual resistors add up to 20V.
Question:
What is the total resistance of the circuit?
Answer:
The total resistance is R_{total}=R_1+R_2=90 \;\Omega+10 \;\Omega=100 \;\Omega
