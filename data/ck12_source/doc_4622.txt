HIV Research:
Beyond the Vaccine
Over the past 15 years, the number of people who die of AIDS each year in the United States has dropped by 70 percent.
But AIDS remains a serious public health crisis among low-income African-Americans, particularly women.
And in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus killed more than 1.6 million people in 2007 alone.
Innovative research approaches could lead to new treatments and possibly a cure for AIDS.
HIV/AIDS has been described as a disease of poverty.
Individuals with poor access to health care are less likely to see a doctor early on in their HIV infection, and thus they may be more likely to transmit the infection.
HIV is now the leading cause of death for African American women between 24 and 35 years old.
For patients who have access to drugs, infection with the virus has ceased to be a death sentence.
In 1995, combinations of drugs called highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) were developed.
For some patients, drugs can reduce the amount of virus to undetectable levels.
But some amount of virus always hides in the body's immune cells and attacks again if the patient stops taking his or her medication.
Researchers are working on developing a drug to wipe out this hidden virus, which could mean the end of AIDS.
