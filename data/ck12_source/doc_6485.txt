The overall cell potential can be calculated by using the equation E^0_{\text{cell}}=E^0_{\text{red}} - E^0_{\text{oxid}} .
Step 2:
Solve.
& \ \ \text{oxidation (anode):} \ \text{Sn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Sn}^{2+}(aq)+2e^- \\& \text{reduction (cathode):} \ \text{Ag}^+(aq)+e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag}(s)
Before adding the two reactions together, the number of electrons lost in the oxidation must equal the number of electrons gained in the reduction.
The silver half-cell reaction must be multiplied by two.
After doing that and adding to the tin half-cell reaction, the overall equation is obtained.
\text{overall equation} \qquad \ \text{Sn}(s)+2\text{Ag}^+(aq) \rightarrow \text{Sn}^{2+}(aq)+2\text{Ag}(s)
The cell potential is calculated.
E^0_{\text{cell}}=E^0_{\text{red}} - E^0_{\text{oxid}}=+0.80 \text{ V} - (-0.14 \text{ V})=+0.94 \text{ V}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The standard cell potential is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous as written.
Tin is oxidized at the anode, while silver ion is reduced at the cathode.
Note that the voltage for the silver ion reduction is not doubled even though the reduction half-reaction had to be doubled to balance the overall redox equation.
Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
A substance which is capable of being reduced very easily is a strong oxidizing agent.
Conversely, a substance which is capable of being oxidized very easily is a strong reducing agent.
According to the standard cell potential table, fluorine (F 2 ) is the strongest oxidizing agent.
It will oxidize any substance below on the table.
