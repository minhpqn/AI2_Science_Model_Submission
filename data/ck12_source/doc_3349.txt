Earth has two north poles, geographic north and magnetic north
Q:
The north end of a compass needle points toward Earth’s north magnetic pole.
The like poles of two magnets repel each other, and the opposite poles attract.
So why doesn’t the north end of a compass needle point to Earth’s south magnetic pole instead?
A:
The answer may surprise you.
The compass needle actually does point to the south pole of magnet Earth.
However, it is called the north magnetic pole because it is close to the north geographic pole.
This naming convention was adopted a long time ago to avoid confusion.
Earth’s Magnetic Field
Like all magnets, Earth has a magnetic field.
Earth’s magnetic field is called the magnetosphere .
You can see a model of the magnetosphere in the Figure below .
It is a huge region that extends outward from Earth in all directions.
Earth exerts magnetic force over the entire field, but the force is strongest at the poles, where lines of force converge.
For an animated model of the magnetosphere, watch this video:  .

Earth acts as a giant magnet with magnetic poles and a magnetic field over which it exerts magnetic force.
Earth has north and south magnetic poles like a bar magnet.
