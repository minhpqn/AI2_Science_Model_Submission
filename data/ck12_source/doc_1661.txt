This process reduces the number of chromosomes by half.
Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each chromosome within a pair is called a homologous chromosome .
For each of the 23 chromosome pairs, you received one chromosome from your father and one chromosome from your mother.
Alleles are alternate forms of genes found on chromosomes.
Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, though they may have different alleles.
So, though homologous chromosomes are very similar, they are not identical.
The homologous chromosomes are separated when gametes are formed.
Therefore, gametes have only 23 chromosomes, not 23 pairs.
Haploid vs.
Diploid
A cell with two sets of chromosomes is diploid , referred to as 2n , where n is the number of sets of chromosomes.
Most of the cells in a human body are diploid.
A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a gamete, is haploid , referred to as n .
Sex cells are haploid.
When a haploid sperm ( n ) and a haploid egg ( n ) combine, a diploid zygote will be formed ( 2n ).
In short, when a diploid zygote is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent.
Overview of Meiosis
Before meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs, so each chromosome contains two sister chromatids that are identical to the original chromosome.
Meiosis ( Figure below ) is divided into two divisions:
Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
