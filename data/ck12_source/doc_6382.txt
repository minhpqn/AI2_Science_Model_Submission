Don’t breathe too deeply.
Venus (pictured above) is the planet nearest to us, but has a very different and hostile environment.
It has a surface temperature that averages around 450°C.
The atmosphere is composed of carbon dioxide, but clouds of sulfuric acid move through the upper atmosphere, helping to create the extremely unfriendly conditions.
Because of these conditions, Venus is not a place you want to visit on vacation.
Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was the first to propose a theory to explain the observed behavior of acids and bases.
Because of their ability to conduct a current, he knew that both acids and bases contained ions in solution.
An Arrhenius acid is a compound, which ionizes to yield hydrogen ions (H + ) in aqueous solution.
Acids are molecular compounds with ionizable hydrogen atoms.
Only hydrogen atoms that are part of a highly polar covalent bond are ionizable.
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a gas at room temperature and under normal pressure.
The H-Cl bond in hydrogen chloride is a polar bond.
The hydrogen atom is electron deficient because of the higher electronegativity of the chlorine atom.
Consequently, the hydrogen atom is attracted to the lone pair of electrons in a water molecule when HCl is dissolved in water.
The result is that the H-Cl bond breaks, with both bonding electrons remaining with the Cl, forming a chloride ion.
The H + ion attaches to the water molecule, forming a polyatomic ion called the hydronium ion.
The hydronium ion (H 3 O + ) can be thought of as a water molecule with an attached hydrogen ion.
Hydrochloric acid ionizes to create hydronium ions in water

Equations showing the ionization of an acid in water are frequently simplified by omitting the water molecule:
