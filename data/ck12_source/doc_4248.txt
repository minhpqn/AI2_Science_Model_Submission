Many birds, fish, and insects migrate.
Mammals such as whales and caribou migrate as well.
Figure below shows the migration route of a bird called a godwit.
Another example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is hibernation.
Hibernation is a state in which an animalâ€™s body processes are slower than usual, and its body temperature falls.
An animal uses less energy than usual during hibernation.
This helps the animal survive during a time of year when food is scarce.
Hibernation may last for weeks or months.
Animals that hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and snakes.
Most people think that bears hibernate.
In fact, bears do not go into true hibernation.
In the winter, they go into a deep sleep.
However, their body processes do not slow down very much.
Their body temperature also remains about the same as usual.
Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep.

Godwit Migration Route.
Godwits make this incredibly long journey twice a year.
In the fall, they migrate from the Arctic to Antarctica.
They make the return flight in the spring.
