Plants that live in moving water, such as streams and rivers, may have different adaptations.
For example, cattails have narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to the moving water (see Figure below ).
Water lilies and cattail adaptations
Water lilies and cattails have different adaptations for life in the water.
Compare the leaves of the two kinds of plants.
How do the leaves help the plants adapt to their watery habitats?
Adaptations to Extreme Dryness
Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem: how to get and keep water.
Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes .
Their adaptations may help them increase water intake, decrease water loss, or store water when it is available.
The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure below has adapted in all three ways.
When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet) from the base of the stem.
By now, its root system is much more widespread.
It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls.
The saguaro doesnâ€™t have any leaves to lose water by transpiration.
It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water.
Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside.
