It shows how natural selection can keep a harmful allele in a gene pool.
You can also watch a video about natural selection and sickle-cell anemia at this link:
Sickle-cell anemia blood cells, and normal red blood cell
Sickle Cell and Natural Selection.
Notice the normal-shaped red blood cell on the left, and the sickle-shaped cell on the right.
100% normal hemoglobin
Somewhat reduced fitness because of no resistance to malaria
Enough normal hemoglobin to prevent sickle-cell anemia
Highest fitness because of resistance to malaria
100% abnormal hemoglobin, causing sickle-cell anemia
Greatly reduced fitness because of sickle-cell anemia
Hereâ€™s how natural selection can keep a harmful allele in a gene pool:
The allele ( S ) for sickle-cell anemia is a harmful autosomal recessive.
It is caused by a mutation in the normal allele ( A ) for hemoglobin (a protein on red blood cells).
Malaria is a deadly tropical disease.
It is common in many African populations.
Heterozygotes ( AS ) with the sickle-cell allele are resistant to malaria.
Therefore, they are more likely to survive and reproduce.
This keeps the S allele in the gene pool.
The sickle-cell example shows that fitness depends on phenotypes.
