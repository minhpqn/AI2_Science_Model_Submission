As explained in Figure below , the response is triggered by chemicals called cytokines and histamines , which are released when tissue is injured or infected.
The chemicals communicate with other cells and coordinate the inflammatory response.
You can see an animation of the inflammatory response at this link:

The chemicals that trigger an inflammatory response attract leukocytes to the site of injury or infection.
Leukocytes are white blood cells.
Their role is to fight infections and get rid of debris.
Leukocytes may respond with either a nonspecific or a specific defense.
A nonspecific defense is the same no matter what type of pathogen is involved.
An example of a nonspecific defense is phagocytosis.
This is the process in which leukocytes engulf and break down pathogens and debris.
It is illustrated in Figure below .
The immune system's first line of defense is also a nonspecific defense.
A specific defense is tailored to a particular pathogen.
Leukocytes involved in this type of defense are part of the immune response and are described in other concepts.
