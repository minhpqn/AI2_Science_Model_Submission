But an important line of evidence for the Big Bang was discovered in 1964.
In a static Universe, the space between objects should have no heat at all.
The temperature should measure 0 K (Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale).
But two researchers at Bell Laboratories used a microwave receiver to measure the background radiation in the Universe.
They discovered that it is not 0 K, but 3 K ( Figure below ).
This tiny amount of heat is left over from the Big Bang.
Nearly all astronomers and cosmologists now accept the Big Bang theory.
One piece of evidence that supports the Big Bang theory is background radiation
Background radiation in the Universe was good evidence for the Big Bang theory.

Nobel Laureate George Smoot and the Origin of the Universe
George Smoot, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the origin of the Universe.
Using background radiation, detected by the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite (COBE), Smoot was able to make a picture of the Universe when it was 12 hours old.

The Big Bang theory states that the Universe began as a point and expanded outward.
No one can know what came before the Big Bang.
The tiny bit of background radiation in the Universe is energy remaining from the Big Bang.
