But we often take them for granted.
Two common types of home heating systems are hot-water and warm-air heating systems.
Both types are described below.
You can watch an animation showing how a solar heating system works at the following URL.
Thermal energy is the total energy of moving particles of matter.
The transfer of thermal energy is called heat.
Therefore, a heating system is a system for the transfer of thermal energy.
Regardless of the type of heating system in a home, the basic function is the same: to produce thermal energy and transfer it to air throughout the house.
Hot-Water Heating System
A hot-water heating system produces thermal energy to heat water and then pumps the hot water throughout the building in a system of pipes and radiators.
You can see a simple diagram of this type of heating system in the Figure below .
Water is heated in a boiler that burns a fuel such as natural gas or heating oil.
The boiler converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel to thermal energy.
The heated water is pumped from the boiler through pipes and radiators throughout the house.
There is usually a radiator in each room.
The radiators get warm when the hot water flows through them.
The warm radiators radiate thermal energy to the air around them.
The warm air then circulates throughout the rooms in convection currents.
The hot water cools as it flows through the system and transfers its thermal energy.
When it finally returns to the boiler, it is heated again and the cycle repeats.
