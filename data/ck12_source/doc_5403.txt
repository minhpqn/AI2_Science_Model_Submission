A disease characterized by a population of cells that grow and divide without respect to normal limits.
evolution :
The change in the characteristics of living organisms over time; the change in species over time.
gene pool :
The complete set of unique alleles in a species or population.
genetic disorder :
A phenotype due to a mutation in a gene or chromosome; a genetic disease.
germline mutation :
Mutation in the DNA within a gamete; can be passed on to descendents.
homeostasis :
The process of maintaining a stable environment inside a cell or an entire organism.
somatic mutation :
A mutation in a body cell, not in a gamete; cannot be transmitted to the next generation.
Mutations are essential for evolution to occur because they increase genetic variation and the potential for individuals to differ.
The majority of mutations are neutral in their effects on the organisms in which they occur.
Harmful mutations can result in errors in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins.
Harmful mutations may cause genetic disorders or cancer.
