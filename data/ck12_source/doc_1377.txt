A shield volcano has a very wide base.
It is much flatter on the top than a composite volcano.
The lava that creates shield volcanoes is relatively thin.
The thin lava spreads out.
This builds a large, flat volcano, layer by layer.
The composition of lava at shield volcanoes is mafic.
Shield volcanoes are very large.
For example, the Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles).
The volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii.
The top of nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its base on the seafloor.
Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries.
They also form at hotspots, like Hawaii.
Shield volcano eruptions are non-explosive.

Cinder cones are the smallest and most common type of volcano.
Cinder cones have steep sides like composite volcanoes.
But they are much smaller, rarely reaching even 300 meters in height.
Cinder cones usually have a crater at the summit.
Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, called cinders.
