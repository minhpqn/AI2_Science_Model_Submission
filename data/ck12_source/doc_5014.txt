That depends.
Most organisms get their energy from the food they make, eat or absorb.
Plants, for example, make their own "food" through the process of photosynthesis.
When we eat a plant, such as lettuce or a tomato, we acquire energy.
This energy is in the form of glucose , a simple sugar.
Or the energy may be in the form of a starch, which we eat and then our body breaks down into glucose.
This glucose then must be converted into usable chemical energy.
Chemical energy in our cells is ATP.
Glucose is converted into ATP during cellular respiration.
This diagram depicts photosynthesis.
CO 2 and H 2 O enter the plant leaf cell, and in the presence of solar energy, these reactants are converted into the products O 2 and glucose.

Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration
What is the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration?
Does photosynthesis have to occur prior to cellular respiration?
No.
Though it is true that the products of photosynthesis are the reactants of cellular respiration, the two can occur simultaneously in the plant cell.
The light reactions of photosynthesis also obviously occur during daylight hours, while the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis and the reactions of cellular respiration can occur whenever reactants are available.
This diagram compares and contrasts photosynthesis (in the chloroplast) and cellular respiration (in the mitochondria).
