How a waterfall forms and moves.
Why does a waterfall keep moving upstream?
Erosion by Slow-Flowing Rivers
Streams eventually run onto flatter ground.
Rivers flowing over gentle slopes erode the sides of their channels more than the bottom.
Large curves, called meanders , form because of erosion and deposition by the moving water.
The curves are called meanders because they slowly “wander,” or meander, over the land.
Below, you can see how this happens ( Figure below ).
Diagram of how meanders form and move
Meanders form because water erodes the outside of curves and deposits eroded material on the inside.
Over time, the curves shift position.
As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain .
This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river.
Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river.
This forms an oxbow lake ( Figure below ).

An oxbow lake forms in the Mackenzie River Delta, Canada.
Faster water carries more and larger sediment.
Streams erode their banks to create V-shaped valleys.
