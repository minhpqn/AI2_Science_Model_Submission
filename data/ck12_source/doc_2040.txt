Dinosaurs reigned the planet for 160 million years.
They had tremendous numbers and diversity.
Some were small and some were very large ( Figure below ).
Some were peaceful plant eaters.
Some were extremely frightening meat eaters.
Some dinosaurs developed protection, such as horns, spikes, tail clubs, and shielding plates.
These adaptations were defense against active predators.
Species of dinosaurs filled all the niches that are currently filled by mammals.
Most dinosaurs lived on land.
Still, pterosaurs flew the skies.
Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swam in the oceans ( Figure below ).
Feathered dinosaurs gave rise to birds.
Drawing of dinosaurs, including a Tyrannosaurus Rex
Some examples of Mesozoic dinosaurs include this Tyrannosaurus Rex, pictured with two Gallimimus.

There is a lot of evidence for this hypothesis.
Some dinosaurs lived in very cold regions.
Many dinosaurs grew fast and were very active.
Dinosaur bones had canals, like birds.
Some dinosaurs stood upright and had big brains.
