The radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
A group of radio telescopes can be linked together with a computer.
The telescopes observe the same object.
The computer then combines the data from each telescope.
This makes the group function like one single telescope.
An example is pictured below ( Figure below ).

Telescopes on Earth all have one big problem: incoming light must pass through the atmosphere.
This blocks some wavelengths of radiation.
Also, motion in the atmosphere distorts light.
You see this when you see stars twinkling in the night sky.
Many observatories are built on high mountains.
There is less air above the telescope, so there is less interference from the atmosphere.
Space telescopes avoid problems from the atmosphere completely since they orbit outside the atmosphere.
The Hubble Space Telescope ( Figure below ) is the best known space telescope.
Hubble began operations in 1994.
Since then, it has provided huge amounts of data.
