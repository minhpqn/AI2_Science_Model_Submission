In short, yes it is.
In the hominids that arose after the split from the orangutans, two chromosomes fused to produce what is chromosome 2 in humans.
This fusion did not occur in the lineage of the other apes, and they retain these separate chromosomes.
This may have occurred to keep two populations from interbreeding, as they would be genetically incompatible, accelerating the divergence of the populations.
allele :
An alternative form or different version of a gene.
Alu sequence :
A short segment of DNA originally characterized by the action of the Alu restriction endonuclease; occur in large numbers in primate genomes.
duplication :
Refers to a mutation that double genetic sequence information.
hominids :
A taxonomic family of primates, including four extant genera: chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan), gorillas (Gorilla), humans (Homo), and orangutans (Pongo); also known as the great apes.
mutation :
A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA or RNA.
short interspersed elements (SINEs) :
Short DNA sequences that represent reverse-transcribed RNA molecules.
signal recognition particle (SRP) :
An abundant universally conserved ribonucleoprotein that recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes.
transposon :
A DNA sequence that can change its relative position (self-transpose) within the genome of a single cell.
