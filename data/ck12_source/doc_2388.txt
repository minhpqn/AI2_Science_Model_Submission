On this scale, F0 tornadoes are the weakest and F5 tornadoes are the strongest.
Percent of Tornadoes by Strength in the U.S. (1986–1995)

Tornadoes
Circle graphs are used to show percents (or fractions) of a whole, such as the percents of F0 to F5 tornadoes out of all tornadoes.
Therefore, a circle graph is a good choice for the data in the table.
The circle graph below displays these data.
Q:
What if the Table above on tornado strength listed the numbers of tornadoes rather than the percents of tornadoes?
Could a circle graph be used to display these data?
A:
No, a circle graph can only be used to show percents (or fractions) of a whole.
However, the numbers could be used to calculate percents, which could then be displayed in a circle graph.

Consider the data in Table below .
It lists the number of tornadoes in the U.S. per month, averaged over the years 2009 to 2011.
Average Number of Tornadoes in the U.S. per Month (2009–2011)
Average Number of Tornadoes
Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time, or time trends in data, such as how the average number of tornadoes varies throughout the year.
