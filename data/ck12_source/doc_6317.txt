Don’t worry about \Delta{G} – just consider it an indication of activation energy as is \Delta{E} in the diagram above.
What does a potential energy diagram tell us?
In the diagram above, which step has the highest activation energy?
If a catalyst lowered the step one activation energy to a value lower than the step two activation energy, which step would be rate-limiting?
