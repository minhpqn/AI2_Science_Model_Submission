When these compounds dissolve in water, they do not produce ions.  The Figure below illustrates the difference between an electrolyte and a nonelectrolyte.
Electrolytic solutions conduct electricity, while nonelectrolytic solutions do not
Roles of Electrolytes in the Body
Several electrolytes play important roles in the body.  Here are a few significant electrolytes:
calcium – in bone and teeth.
Also important for muscle contraction, blood clotting, and nerve function.
sodium – found outside the cell.
Mainly involved in water balance as well as nerve signaling.
potassium – major cation inside the cell.
Important for proper functioning of heart, muscles, kidneys, and nerves.
magnesium – in bone and cells.
Involved in muscle, bone, nervous system, and takes part in many biochemical reactions.
Electrolytes conduct electric current when in solution or melted.
Nonelectrolytes do not conduct electric current when in solution or melted.
