Energy allows all the processes inside cells to occur.
Baby animals also need energy to grow and develop.
Birds and wasps build nests to have a safe place to store their eggs and raise their young.
Many other animals build nests for the same reason.
Animals protect their young in other ways, as well.
For example, a mother dog not only nurses her puppies.
She also washes them with her tongue and protects them from strange people or other animals.
All of these behaviors help the young survive and grow up to be adults.
Rabbits run away from foxes and other predators to stay alive.
Their speed is their best defense.
Lizards sun themselves on rocks to get warm because they cannot produce their own body heat.
When they are warmer, they can move faster and be more alert.
This helps them escape from predators and also find food.
All of these animal behaviors are important.
They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive.
Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animalsâ€™ fitness.
Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation.
If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species.
This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection.
Animal behavior is any way that animals act, either alone or with other animals.
