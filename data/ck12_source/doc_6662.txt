Animals that are active during the daytime are called diurnal .
Some animals do the opposite.

Examples of nocturnal animals include bats, foxes, possums, skunks and coyotes.
Many mammals (including humans), insects, reptiles and birds are diurnal.
Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well.
Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too.
Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside.
Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms .
In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock .
This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain.
The biological clock sends signals to the body.
The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes.
The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock.
The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.
Yearly cycles of behavior include hibernation and migration.
Daily cycles of behavior, including sleeping a waking, are called circadian rhythms.
