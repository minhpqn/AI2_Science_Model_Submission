A chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form one single molecule, together with the loss of a small molecule, often water.
functional group :
Part of organic compound that generally determines the nature and functions of the compound.
hydrolysis reaction :
A chemical process in which a molecule of water is split, resulting in the separation of a large molecule into two smaller molecules.
lipid :
Organic compound such as fat or oil.
macromolecule :
A large molecule composed of individual monomer units.
nucleic acid :
Organic compound such as DNA or RNA.
nucleotide :
Monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar, and a phosphate group.
organic compound :
Compound found in living organisms; contains mainly carbon.
protein :
Organic compound made of amino acids.
Carbonâ€™s exceptional ability to form bonds with other elements and with itself allows it to form a huge number of large, complex molecules called organic molecules.
These molecules make up organisms and carry out life processes.
Why is carbon essential to all known life on Earth?
