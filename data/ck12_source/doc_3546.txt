A model of a channel protein and carrier proteins is shown in Figure below .
Facilitated diffusion through the cell membrane
Facilitated diffusion through the cell membrane.
Channel proteins and carrier proteins are shown (but not a gated-channel protein).
Water molecules and ions move through channel proteins.
Other ions or molecules are also carried across the cell membrane by carrier proteins.
The ion or molecule binds to the active site of a carrier protein.
The carrier protein changes shape, and releases the ion or molecule on the other side of the membrane.
The carrier protein then returns to its original shape.

Ions such as sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca 2+ ), and chloride (Cl - ), are important for many cell functions.
Because they are charged (polar), these ions do not diffuse through the membrane.
Instead they move through ion channel proteins where they are protected from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.
Ion channels allow the formation of a concentration gradient between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol.
Ion channels are very specific, as they allow only certain ions through the cell membrane.
Some ion channels are always open, others are "gated" and can be opened or closed.
Gated ion channels can open or close in response to different types of stimuli, such as electrical or chemical signals.
Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes through transport proteins in the plasma membrane.
Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.
