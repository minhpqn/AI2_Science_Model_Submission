plum pudding :
In 1904 J.J.
Thomson developed this model.
The electrons were stuck into a uniform lump of positive charge like blueberries in a muffin.
The positive matter was thought to be jelly- like or a thick soup.
The electrons could move around somewhat.
As they got closer to the outer portion of the atom, the positive charge in the region was greater than the neighboring negative charges and the electron would be pulled back more toward the center region of the atom.
Rutherford’s Atomic Model
Describe Rutherford’s gold foil experiment.
Describe the nuclear model of the atom.
Picture of a brick wall
How much space do bricks occupy?
As we look at the world around us, it looks pretty solid.
We hit a wall with our hand and the hand stops – it does not (normally) go through the wall.
We think of matter as occupying space.
But there is a lot of empty space in matter.
In fact, most of the matter is empty space.
The Gold Foil Experiment
In 1911, Rutherford and coworkers Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden initiated a series of groundbreaking experiments that would completely change the accepted model of the atom.
They bombarded very thin sheets of gold foil with fast moving alpha particles .
