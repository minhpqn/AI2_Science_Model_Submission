\text{HCl}(g) \rightarrow \text{H}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-
This is merely a simplification of the previous equation, but it is commonly used.
Any hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution will be attached to water molecules as hydronium ions.
Not all hydrogen atoms in molecular compounds are ionizable.
In methane (CH 4 ), the hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to carbon in bonds that are only slightly polar.
The hydrogen atoms are not capable of ionizing and methane has no acidic properties.
Acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) belongs to a class of acids called organic acids.
There are four hydrogen atoms in the molecule, but only the one hydrogen that is bonded to an oxygen atom is ionizable.
Acetic acid generates hydronium ions when dissolved in water
The O-H bond can be ionized to yield the H + ion and the acetate ion.
The other hydrogen atoms in this molecule are not acidic.
The Table below lists some of the more common acids:
H 2 SO 4
H 3 PO 4
CH 3 COOH
A monoprotic acid is an acid that contains only one ionizable hydrogen.
Hydrochloric acid and acetic acid are monoprotic acids.
A polyprotic acid is an acid that contains multiple ionizable hydrogens.
Most common polyprotic acids are either diprotic (such as H 2 SO 4 ) or triprotic (such as H 3 PO 4 ).
Arrhenius acid is defined.
