When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, and the electrons jump to a higher energy level.
As the excited electrons return to their original energy level, they give off visible light.
Neon produces red light.
Other gases produce light of different colors.
For example, krypton produces violet light, and argon produces blue light.
A vapor light also produces visible light by electroluminescence The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases.
When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light.
Sodium vapor lights, like the streetlight pictured in the Figure below , produce yellowish light.
Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light.
In addition to lighting city streets, vapor lights are used to light highways and stadiums.
The bulbs are very bright and long lasting so they are a good choice for these places.
LED stands for “light-emitting diode.” An LED light contains a material called a semi-conductor, which gives off visible light when an electric current flows through it.
LED lights are used for traffic lights (see Figure below ) and also indicator lights on computers, cars, and many other devices.
This type of light is very reliable and durable.
Q:
Some light bulbs produce a lot of heat in addition to visible light, so they waste energy.
Other bulbs produce much less heat, so they use energy more efficiently.
Which light bulbs described above would you place in each category?
A:
Incandescent light bulbs, which produce light by incandescence, give off a lot of heat as well as light, so they waste energy.
