Electric Power and Electrical Energy Use
Explain how to calculate the electric power of an appliance.
Identify the SI unit for power, including electric power.
Show how to calculate the electrical energy used by an appliance.
Miranda has to use a hair dryer in order to dry her long hair quickly enough to get to school on time.
She has a powerful hair dryer that dries her hair faster than a less powerful hair dryer would.
That’s because a more powerful hair dryer changes electric current to thermal energy more quickly.
The rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy is called electric power .
The SI unit for power—including electric power—is the watt.
A watt equals 1 joule of energy per second.
High wattages are often expressed in kilowatts, where 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts.
The power of an electric device, such as a hair dryer, can be calculated if you know the voltage of the circuit and how much current the device receives.
The following equation is used:
Power (watts) = Current (amps) × Voltage (volts)
Assume that Miranda’s hair dryer is the only electric device in a 120-volt circuit that carries 15 amps of current.
Then the power of her hair dryer in kilowatts is:
Power = 15 amps × 120 volts = 1800 watts, or 1.8 kilowatts
