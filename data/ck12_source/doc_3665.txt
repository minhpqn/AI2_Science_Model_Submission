Why is this a fair way to decide who goes first?
If you choose heads, what is the chance that the toss will go your way?
If you toss a coin twice, you might expect to get one head and one tail.
But each time you toss the coin, the chance of a head is still 50 percent.
Therefore, it’s quite likely that you will get two or even several heads (or tails) in a row.
What if you tossed a coin ten times?
You would probably get more or less than the expected five heads.
For example, you might get seven heads (70 percent) and three tails (30 percent).
The more times you toss the coin, however, the closer you will get to 50 percent heads.
For example, if you tossed a coin 1000 times, you might get 510 heads and 490 tails.
Probability and Inheritance
The same rules of probability in coin tossing apply to the main events that determine the genotypes of offspring.
These events are the formation of gametes during meiosis and the union of gametes during fertilization.
Probability and Gamete Formation
How is gamete formation like tossing a coin?
Consider Mendel’s purple-flowered pea plants again.
Assume that a plant is heterozygous for the flower-color allele, so it has the genotype Bb (see Figure below ).
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes, and the alleles they carry, segregate and go to different gametes.
Therefore, when the Bb pea plant forms gametes, the B and b alleles segregate and go to different gametes.
As a result, half the gametes produced by the Bb parent will have the B allele and half will have the b allele.
