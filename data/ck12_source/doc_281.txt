This type of pulley is called a  fixed pulley , and is labeled  A  in the image below.

Another type of pulley is shown above as  B .
This type of pulley is called a  movable pulley.  A set of pulleys assembled so they rotate independently on the same axle form a block.
It is shown below in a system called a  block and tackle .
A block and tackle consists of two blocks, in which one block is fixed and the other is movable; the movable block is attached to the load.
The IMA of a pulley system can be determined by counting the number of supporting strands of rope in the system.
Be careful though, because in some systems the rope to which the effort force is applied will be a supporting strand, but in others it is not.
For example, in the image above with the five pulley systems, the rope to which the effort force is applied (the one with the arrowhead) in  A  is not a supporting strand because it does not hold up any of the weight of the load.
The IMA of  A  is 1.
In  B , however, the effort rope is supporting half of the weight of the load and is therefore a supporting strand.  B  has 2 supporting strands and an IMA of 2.
Example Problem:  Determine the IMA for  C, D,  and  E  in the image above.
C = 2 supporting strands;
IMA = 2
D = 3 supporting strands;
IMA = 3
E = 3 supporting strands;
IMA = 3
If the direction of the effort force is in the same direction and the movement of the load, the effort strand will be a supporting strand.
If the direction of the effort force is in the same direction as the resistance force, the effort strand is not a supporting strand.
