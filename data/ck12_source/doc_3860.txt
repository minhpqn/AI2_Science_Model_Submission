When it comes to energy, ecosystems are not closed.
They need constant inputs of energy.
Most ecosystems get energy from sunlight.
A small minority get energy from chemical compounds.
Unlike energy, matter is not constantly added to ecosystems.
Instead, it is recycled.
Water and elements such as carbon and nitrogen are used over and over again.
One of the most important concepts associated with the ecosystem is the niche.
A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem.
It includes all the ways that the species interacts with the biotic and abiotic factors of the environment.
Two important aspects of a species’ niche are the food it eats and how the food is obtained.
Look at Figure below .
It shows pictures of birds that occupy different niches.
Each species eats a different type of food and obtains the food in a different way.
An illustration of different bird beak types adapted for its niche
Bird Niches.
Each of these species of birds has a beak that suits it for its niche.
For example, the long slender beak of the nectarivore allows it to sip liquid nectar from flowers.
The short sturdy beak of the granivore allows it to crush hard, tough grains.
Another aspect of a species’ niche is its habitat.
