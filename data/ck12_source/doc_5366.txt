The translational machinery “reads” the mRNA base by base until a AUG start codon is identified.
The mRNA is then translated codon by codon until it reaches a stop codon .
Stop codons are not associated with a tRNA or amino acid and signal the end of translation.
There are three stop codons:
UAG, UGA, UAA.
Stop codons are also known as termination codons.
The Reading Frame
The reading frame is the frame of three bases in which the mRNA is read and translated.
Every sequence can be read in three reading frames, each of which will produce a different amino acid sequence.
For example, in the sequence GCAUGGGGGUCUAG, the reading frame can begin with either the first G, the first C, or the first A.
As stated above, translation starts with the start codon which consists of the three bases AUG.
Each subsequent codon is translated until an "in-frame" stop codon is reached.
In the example above, the polypeptide sequence would be: methionine – glycine – valine – stop.
Mutations that disrupt the reading frame by insertions or deletions of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases are known as frameshift mutations .
Take the example THEBIGFATCATATETHEREDRAT.
Broken into codons, this example would be easily read as:
THE BIG FAT CAT ATE THE RED RAT.
However, a deletion mutation that disrupts the reading frame, results in a message that does not make any sense.
If the ‘B’ is deleted:
THE IGF ATC ATA TET HER EDR AT.
