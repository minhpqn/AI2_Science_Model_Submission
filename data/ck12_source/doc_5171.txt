These cells eventually differentiate into mature sperm or egg cells.
During meiosis the pairs of homologous chromosomes separate and segregate randomly to produce gametes with one chromosome from each pair.
Only germ cells like spermatocytes and oocytes, can undergo meiosis.
Overview of Meiosis.
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different daughter cells.
This diagram shows just the nuclei of the cells.
Notice the exchange of genetic material that occurs prior to the first cell division.
Prior to meiosis, the cellâ€™s DNA is replicated, generating chromosomes with two sister chromatids.
Meiosis involves two nuclear and cell divisions without an interphase in between, so the DNA is not replicated prior to the second round of divisions.
Each division, named meiosis I and meiosis II, has four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis.
These stages are similar to those of mitosis, but there are distinct and important differences.
A human cell prior to meiosis will have 46 chromosomes, 22 pairs of homologous autosomes, and 1 pair of sex chromosomes.
At the end of meiosis, each haploid cell will have 22 autosomes (not pairs) and 1 sex chromosome, either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome.
You inherit one chromosome of each pair from your mother and the other one from your father.

The Eight Phases
Meiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase of the cell cycle.
In both meiosis I and meiosis II , cells go through the same four phases as mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.
However, there are important differences between meiosis I and mitosis.
