Another human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago ( Figure below ).
These animals were completely bipedal.
Their brains grew rapidly across the generations.
Model of Australopithecus afarensis
Australopithecus afarensis is a human ancestor that lived about 3 million years ago.
The genus Homo , which has modern humans as its only living species, appeared about 2.5 million years ago.
These human-like primates developed the first stone tools.
Homo erectus evolved in Africa about 1.8 million years ago.
Fossils of these animals show a much more human-like body structure.
This allowed them to travel long distances to hunt.
Cultures began and evolved.
Homo sapiens is our species.
We originated about 200,000 years ago in Africa.
Evidence of a spiritual life appears about 32,000 years ago.
The evidence includes stone figurines that probably have religious significance ( Figure below ).
Stone figurines created by early Homo sapiens
Stone figurines likely indicate a spiritual life.
The ice ages allowed humans to migrate.
During the ice ages, water was frozen in glaciers.
Land bridges such as the Bering Strait allowed humans to walk from the Old World to the New World.
