Tiny hairs lining the semicircular canals sense movement of the fluid.
In response, they send nerve impulses to the vestibular nerve , which carries the impulses to the brain.
The brain interprets the impulses and sends messages to the peripheral nervous system.
This system maintains the body’s balance by triggering contractions of skeletal muscles as needed.
Taste and Smell
Taste and smell are both abilities to sense chemicals.
Like other sense receptors, both taste receptors and odor receptors send nerve impulses to the brain, and the brain “tells” use what we are tasting or smelling.
Taste receptors are found in tiny bumps on the tongue called taste buds (see Figure below ).
There are separate taste receptors for sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and meaty tastes.
The meaty taste is called umami .
You can learn more about taste receptors and the sense of taste by watching the animation at the following link:
Taste buds on the tongue contain taste receptor cells.
Odor receptors line the passages of the nose (see Figure below ).
They sense chemicals in the air.
In fact, odor receptors can sense hundreds of different chemicals.
Did you ever notice that food seems to have less taste when you have a stuffy nose?
This occurs because the sense of smell contributes to the sense of taste, and a stuffy nose interferes with the ability to smell.
Odor receptors.
Odor receptors and their associated nerves (in yellow) line the top of the nasal passages.
Touch is the ability to sense pressure.
