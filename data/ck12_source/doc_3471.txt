Where does your energy come from?
Can energy be recycled?
This team of ants is breaking down a dead tree.
A classic example of teamwork.
And all that work takes energy.
In fact, each chemical reaction - the chemical reactions that allow the cells in those ants to do the work - needs energy to get started.
And all that energy comes from the food the ants eat.
Whatever eats the ants gets their energy from the ants.
Energy passes through an ecosystem in one direction only.
Chemical Reactions and Energy
Chemical reactions always involve energy.
Energy is a property of matter that is defined as the ability to do work.
When methane burns, for example, it releases energy in the form of heat and light.
Other chemical reactions absorb energy rather than release it.
A chemical reaction that releases energy (as heat) is called an exothermic reaction .
This type of reaction can be represented by a general chemical equation:
Reactants â†’ Products + Heat
In addition to methane burning, another example of an exothermic reaction is chlorine combining with sodium to form table salt.
This reaction also releases energy.
A chemical reaction that absorbs energy is called an endothermic reaction .
