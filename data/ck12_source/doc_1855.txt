How did wind modify this landscape?
Erosion and deposition by wind leave very different landscapes behind.
Like water, when wind slows down it drops the sediment it's carrying.
This often happens when the wind has to move over or around an obstacle.
A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down.
As the wind slows, it deposits the largest particles first.
Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited.
When the wind deposits sand, it forms small hills.
These hills are called sand dunes ( Figure below ).
For sand dunes to form, there must be plenty of sand and wind.
Sand dunes are found mainly in deserts and on beaches.
