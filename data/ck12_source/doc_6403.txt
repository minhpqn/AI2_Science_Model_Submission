What is the pH of a 3.67 × 10 -5 M NaBr solution?
If we have a weak base with a low ionization constant, can we assume that the [OH - ] in the solution is equal to the concentration of the base?
The pOH Concept
Perform calculations of pOH.
This alkaline lake is thought to have healing properties
Can water have healing properties?
Soap Lake has a long history as a healing place.
Indian tribes would put aside their rivalries when they came to the lake to enjoy the high mineral content of the water.
In the days before good antibiotics, thousands of visitors would come and enjoy the soothing waters of the lake.
Soap Lake is alkaline, with water quality thought to be similar to that of the moons of the planet Jupiter.
The pOH Concept
As with the hydrogen-ion concentration, the concentration of the hydroxide ion can be expressed logarithmically by the pOH.
The pOH of a solution is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide-ion concentration.
pOH = -log[OH - ]
The pH of a solution can be related to the pOH.
Consider a solution with a pH = 4.0.
The [H + ] of the solution would be 1.0 × 10 -4  M.
Dividing  K_w by this yields a [OH − ] of 1.0 × 10 -10 M.
Finally the pOH of the solution equals -log(1.0 × 10 -10 ) = 10.
This example illustrates the following relationship.
