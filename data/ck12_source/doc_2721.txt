Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air.
However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.

Presence of a Catalyst
Some reactions need extra help to occur quickly.
They need another substance called a catalyst.
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction.
A catalyst isn’t a reactant, so it isn’t changed or used up in the reaction.
Therefore, it can catalyze many other reactions.
How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the reaction rate.
Several factors affect the rate of a chemical reaction, including the temperature, concentration, and surface area of reactants, and the presence of a catalyst.
Watch the video about reaction rate at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.
What is collision theory?
How does collision theory relate to factors that affect reaction rate?
Define reaction rate.
List factors that influence the rate of a chemical reaction.
Choose one of the factors you listed in your answer to question 2, and explain how it affects reaction rate.
Explain how catalysts work.
Identify the role of catalysts in living things.
