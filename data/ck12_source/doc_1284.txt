In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions.
Now its activity is best seen in the regionâ€™s famous geysers.
Not all geological activity is found at plate boundaries.
Activity within a plate is called intraplate activity.
Most intraplate activity occurs at hotspots.
Hotspot volcanoes erupt mostly on oceanic crust.
A few hotspots erupt on continental crust.
The difference is due to the thickness of the crust.
Hotspots can be used to tell the speed and direction that a plate is moving.
