Clouds that form in the mid troposphere have the prefix “alto-”, as in altocumulus.
Where do stratocumulus clouds form?
Clouds and Temperature
Clouds can affect the temperature on Earth’s surface.
During the day, thick clouds block some of the Sun’s rays.
This keeps the surface from heating up as much as it would on a clear day.
At night, thick clouds prevent heat from radiating out into space.
This keeps the surface warmer than it would be on a clear night.
Water vapor condenses on particles in the air to form clouds.
Clouds block sunlight in the day.
Clouds trap heat in the atmosphere at night.
Cloud types include cirrus, stratus, and cumulus.
