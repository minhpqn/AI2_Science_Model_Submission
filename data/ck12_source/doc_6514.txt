{^{235}_{\phantom{0}92}\text{U}} + {^1_0n} \rightarrow {^{92}_{36}\text{Kr}} + {^{142}_{\phantom{0}56}\text{Ba}} + 2{^1_0n} + \text{energy}
There are a total of 236 mass units on the left of the equation and 236 mass units on the right.
In the same manner, we see 92 protons on the left and 92 on the right.
The energy that is released is the binding energy that holds the nucleus together.
Another set of fission products from U-235 can be seen in the following reaction:
{^{235}_{\phantom{0}92}\text{U}} + {^1_0n} \rightarrow {^{95}_{42}\text{Mo}} + {^{139}_{\phantom{0}57}\text{La}} + 2{^1_0n} + \text{energy}
Again we see that the total number of mass units and of protons is equal on both sides of the equation.
The process of nuclear fission is described.
Examples of nuclear fission processes are illustrated.
