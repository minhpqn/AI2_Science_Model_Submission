Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins; a family of proteins involved in transmitting chemical signals outside the cell, causing changes inside the cell.
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) :
Serine/threonine specific protein kinases related to the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs); involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli; involved in the regulate of proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis.
oncogene :
Cancer promoting gene; the products of these genes result in uncontrolled cell growth and division, protection against programmed cell death, loss of respect for normal tissue boundaries, and the ability to become established in diverse tissue environments.
p53 :
A tumor suppressor protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.
proto-oncogene :
Gene whose product promotes cell growth and mitosis prior to cell division; normal gene within all cells; becomes an oncogene when mutated.
ras :
A small GTPase involved in transmitting signals within cells; first identified in rat sarcoma cells.
tumor suppressor gene :
Gene whose product temporarily discourage cell growth and division to allow cells to finish routine functions, especially DNA repair.
At least two separate mutations are necessary to develop cancer.
These mutations may occur in proto-oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes.
Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have an interconnected relationship within the cell; many are involved in signal transduction cascades.
