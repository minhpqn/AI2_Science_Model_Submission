Some of these proteins are secreted from the cell (they exit the cell); others are placed into the cell membrane.
Organelles of a eukaryotic cell
Eukaryotic cells contain special compartments surrounded by membranes, called organelles.
For example, notice in this image the mitochondria, lysosomes, and Golgi apparatus.
Also, the cytoskeleton gives the cell its shape, and the flagella helps the cell to move.
Prokaryotic cells may also have flagella.
The nucleus stores the genetic information.
The vacuoles are needed for storage.
The lysosomes recycle waste.
The cytoskeleton provides the shape of the cell.
The ribosomes produce proteins.
The rough ER is covered with ribosomes and makes proteins, while the smooth ER makes lipids.
The Golgi apparatus packages proteins.
