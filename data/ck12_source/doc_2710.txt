The energy needed for the reaction to take place comes from the water, which gets colder as the reaction proceeds.
One of the most important series of endothermic reactions is photosynthesis.
In photosynthesis, plants make the simple sugar glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) from carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O).
They also release oxygen (O 2 ) in the process.
The reactions of photosynthesis are summed up by this chemical equation:
6 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O â†’ C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 O 2
The energy for photosynthesis comes from light.
Without light energy, photosynthesis cannot occur.
As you can see in the Figure below , plants can get the energy they need for photosynthesis from either sunlight or artificial light.
Plants photosynthesize using sunlight or artificial light
An endothermic reaction is a chemical reaction in which more energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products.
A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed to keep an endothermic reaction going.
