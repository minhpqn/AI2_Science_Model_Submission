The rate of the nuclear reaction is dependent on how many neutrons are emitted by one U-235 nuclear disintegration and how many strike a new U-235 nucleus to cause another disintegration.
The purpose of the control rods is to absorb some of the neutrons and thus stop them from causing further disintegrations.
The control rods can be raised or lowered into the fuel rod bundle.
When the control rods are lowered all the way into the fuel rod bundle, they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction essentially stops.
When more heat is desired, the control rods are raised so that the chain reaction speeds up and more heat is generated.
The control rods are operated in a fail-safe system so that power is necessary to hold them up.
During a power failure, gravity will pull the control rods down to shut off the system.

U-235 nuclei can capture neutrons and disintegrate more efficiently if the neutrons are moving slower than the speed at which they are released.
Fission reactors use a moderator surrounding the fuel rods to slow down the neutrons.
Water is not only a good coolant but also a good moderator, so a common type of fission reactor has the fuel core submerged in a huge pool of water.
This type of reactor is called a light water reactor or LWR.
All public electricity generating fission reactors in the United States are LWRs.

You can follow the operation of an electricity-generating fission reactor in the image above.
The reactor core is submerged in a pool of water.
The heat from the fission reaction heats the water, which is pumped into a heat exchange container.
There the heated water boils the water in the heat exchanger.
The produced steam is forced through a turbine that spins a generator and produces electricity.
After the water passes through the turbine, it is condensed back to liquid water and pumped back to the heat exchanger.
