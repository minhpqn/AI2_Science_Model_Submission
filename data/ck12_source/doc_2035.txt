Shells could protect them from predators and from drying out.
Some organisms evolved external skeletons.
These are called exoskeletons .
Organisms with hard parts also make good fossils.
Fossils from the Cambrian are much more abundant than fossils from the Precambrian.
The Cambrian Explosion
The warm, humid climate of the early Cambrian was good for life.
There was a tremendous increase in diversity.
There was also an amazing increase in the number of living things.
For these two reasons, this time period is called the Cambrian Explosion.
With so much diversity, complex ecosystems could develop.
All of this life was in the seas.
The Paleozoic Continues
Paleozoic seas were full of worms, snails, clams, trilobites, sponges, and brachiopods.
Organisms with shells were common.
The first fish were simple, armored, jawless fish.
Fish have internal skeletons.
Some, like sharks, skates, and rays, have skeletons of cartilage.
More advanced fish have skeletons of bones.
Fish evolved jaws and many other adaptations for ocean life.
