The Electric Field
Define an electric field.
Solve problems relating to field, force, and charge.
Plasma globes contain strong electrical fields
A plasma globe, such as the one pictured above, is filled with a mixture of noble gases and has a high-voltage electrode at the center.
The swirling lines are electric discharge lines that connect from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator.
When a hand is placed on the surface of the globe, all the electric discharge travels directly to that hand.
The Electric Field
Coulombâ€™s Law gives us the formula to calculate the force exerted on a charge by another charge.
On some occasions, however, a test charge suffers an electrical force with no apparent cause.
That is, as observers, we cannot see or detect the original charge creating the electrical force.
Michael Faraday dealt with this problem by developing the concept of an electric field.
According to Faraday, a charge creates an electric field about it in all directions.
If a second charge is placed at some point in the field, the second charge interacts with the field and experiences an electrical force.
Thus, the interaction we observe is between the test charge and the field and a second particle at some distance is no longer necessary.
The strength of the electric field is determined point by point and can only be identified by the presence of test charge.
When a positive test charge, q t ,  is placed in an electric field, the field exerts a force on the charge.
The field strength can be measured by dividing the force by the charge of the test charge.
Electric field strength is given the symbol  E and its unit is Newtons/coulomb.
The test charge can be moved from location to location within the electric field until the entire electric field has been mapped in terms of electric field intensity.
