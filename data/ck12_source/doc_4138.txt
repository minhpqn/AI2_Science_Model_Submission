However, plants existed for hundreds of millions of years before they evolved flowers.
In fact, the earliest plants were different from most modern plants in several important ways.
They not only lacked flowers, but also lacked leaves, roots, and stems.
You might not even recognize them as plants.
So why are the earliest plants placed in the plant kingdom?
What traits define a plant?
What are Plants?
Plants are multicellular eukaryotic organisms with cell walls made of cellulose .
Plant cells also have chloroplasts .
In addition, plants have specialized reproductive organs.
These are structures that produce reproductive cells.
Male reproductive organs produce sperm, and female reproductive organs produce eggs.
Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same or different plants.
How Do Plants Obtain Food?
Almost all plants make food by photosynthesis .
Only about 1 percent of the estimated 300,000 species of plants have lost the ability to photosynthesize.
These other species are consumers, many of them predators.
How do plants prey on other organisms?
The Venus fly trap in Figure below shows one way this occurs.
