Molecules can differ in the way the atoms are arranged â€“ the same combination of atoms can be assembled in more than one way.
These compounds are known as isomers.
Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formulas, but different arrangements of atoms.
We will look at some isomer possibilities for alkanes and alkenes.
A structural isomer is one in which two or more or organic compounds have the same molecular formulas but different structures.
The two pentane molecules below differ only in the location of the methyl group.
Example of alkane structural isomers
Alkenes can also demonstrate structural isomerism.
In alkenes, there are multiple structural isomers based on where in the chain the double bond occurs.
The condensed structural formulas of 1-butene and 2-butene show this.
Example of alkene structural isomers
The number in the name of the alkene refers to the lowest numbered carbon in the chain that is part of the double bond.
With a molecule such as 2-butene, a different type of isomerism called geometric isomerism can be observed.
Geometric isomers are isomers in which the order of atom bonding is the same but the arrangement of atoms in space is different.
The double bond in an alkene is not free to rotate because of the nature of the pi bond.
Therefore, there are two different ways to construct the 2-butene molecule.
The image below shows the two geometric isomers, called cis -2-butene and trans -2-butene.
Cis and trans alkenes are geometric isomers
The cis isomer has the two single hydrogen atoms on the same side of the molecule, while the trans isomer has them on opposite sides of the molecule.
In both molecules, the bonding order of the atoms is the same.
