Mesophyll makes up most of the leafâ€™s interior.
This is where photosynthesis occurs.
Mesophyll consists mainly of parenchymal cells with chloroplasts.
Veins are made primarily of xylem and phloem.
They transport water and minerals to the cells of leaves and carry away dissolved sugar.
The epidermis of the leaf consists of a single layer of tightly-packed dermal cells.
They secrete waxy cuticle to prevent evaporation of water from the leaf.
The epidermis has tiny pores called stomata (singular, stoma) that control transpiration and gas exchange with the air.
For photosynthesis, stomata must control the transpiration of water vapor and the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.
Stomata are flanked by guard cells that swell or shrink by taking in or losing water through osmosis .
When they do, they open or close the stomata (see Figure below ).
Stomata of a plant leaf
For photosynthesis, stomata must control the transpiration of water vapor and the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.
Stomata are flanked by guard cells that swell or shrink by taking in or losing water through osmosis.
When they do, they open or close the stomata.
Specialized cells and tissues in leaves work together to perform photosynthesis.
