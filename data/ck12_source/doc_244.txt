If the object goes around once in 1.18 s, what is the centripetal acceleration?
circular motion:
A movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path.
centripetal acceleration:
The acceleration toward the center that keeps an object following a circular path.
Define centripetal force.
Solve problems involving centripetal force.
Explain the difference between centripetal and centrifugal forces.
Jupiter's moons and rings obey centripetal force
Jupiter's moons and ring materials follow all the laws of physics, including centripetal force and centripetal acceleration.
Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration.
Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle.  That force is the centripetal force.
For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity.
When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain.
Newton's second law shows the relationship between force and acceleration, F = ma .  Since we have formulas expressing the relationships for centripetal acceleration, they can easily be altered to show the relationships for centripetal force.
a_c=\frac{v^2}{r} \ and \ F=ma \ so \ F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}
a_c=\frac{4 \pi^2 r}{T^2} \ \text{so} \ F_c=\frac{4 \pi^2 rm}{T^2}
Many people incorrectly use the term centrifugal force  instead of centripetal force .
Often, you will hear the term centrifugal force used to describe the outward force pushing an object away from the center of a circle.
In reality, however, centrifugal forces are inertial, or fictional, forces.
