What Can Be Done?
Efforts to reduce future global warming mainly involve energy use.
We need to use less energy, for example, by driving more fuel-efficient cars.
We also need to switch to energy sources that produce less carbon dioxide, such as solar and wind energy.
At the same time, we can increase the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed from air.
We can stop destroying forests and plant new ones.
Gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the natural greenhouse effect.
This is raising the temperature of Earthâ€™s surface, and is called global warming.
