A nuclear chain reaction is similar to a pile of wood burning.
If you start one piece of wood burning, enough heat is produced by the burning wood to start the rest of the pile burning without any further help from you.
You can see another example of a chain reaction at this URL:

Using Energy from Nuclear Fission
If a nuclear chain reaction is uncontrolled, it produces a lot of energy all at once.
This is what happens in an atomic bomb.
However, if a nuclear chain reaction is controlled, it produces energy much more slowly.
This is what occurs in a nuclear power plant.
The reaction is controlled by inserting rods of nonfissioning material into the fissioning material.
You can see this in the Figure below .
The radiation from the controlled fission is used to heat water and turn it to steam.
The steam is under pressure and causes a turbine to spin.
The spinning turbine runs a generator, which produces electricity.

Pros and Cons of Nuclear Energy
In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels.
This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things.
The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming.
