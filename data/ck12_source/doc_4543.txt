What is hypertension?
To take your pulse, you press your fingers against an artery near the surface of the body.
What are you feeling and measuring when you take your pulse?
Why can’t you take your pulse by pressing your fingers against a vein?
Outline pathways of the pulmonary and systemic circulations.
How does oxygen get into the blood?
The main function of the circulatory system is to pump blood carrying oxygen around the body.
But how does that oxygen get into the blood in the first place?
You may already know that this occurs in the lungs.
So the blood must also be pumped to the lungs, and this happens separately from the rest of the body.
Pulmonary and Systemic Circulations
The circulatory system actually consists of two separate systems: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation.
You can watch animations of both systems at the following link.
Pulmonary circulation is the part of the circulatory system that carries blood between the heart and lungs (the term “pulmonary” means “of the lungs”).
It is illustrated in Figure below .
Deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle through pulmonary arteries, which transport it to the lungs.
In the lungs, the blood gives up carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen.
The oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium of the heart through pulmonary veins.

The pulmonary circulation carries blood between the heart and lungs.
