Many mutations are not caused by errors in replication.
Mutations can happen spontaneously, and they can be caused by mutagens in the environment.
Some chemicals, such as those found in tobacco smoke, can be mutagens.
Sometimes mutagens can also cause cancer.
Tobacco smoke, for example, is often linked to lung cancer.
A mutation is a permanent change in the sequence of bases in DNA.
Mutations occur in the DNA through deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion, and translocation within the chromosome.
Mutations can occur due to errors during DNA replication or by mutagens in the environment.
