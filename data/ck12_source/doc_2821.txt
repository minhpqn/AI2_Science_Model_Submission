You may have seen this sign before—maybe in a hospital.
The sign means there is danger of radiation in the area.
Radiation consists of particles and energy that are given off by radioactive isotopes, which have unstable nuclei.
But you don’t have to go to a hospital to be exposed to radiation.
There is radiation in the world all around you.
Radiation in the Environment
A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment.
This is called background radiation.
One source of background radiation is rocks, which may contain small amounts of radioactive elements such as uranium.
Another source is cosmic rays.
These are charged particles that arrive on Earth from outer space.
Background radiation is generally considered to be safe for living things.
