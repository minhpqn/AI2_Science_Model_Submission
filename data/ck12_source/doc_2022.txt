Some live very far below the surface and never come up.
All are well adapted to their watery environment.
Have you been to a rocky shore and seen the intertidal ?
It's the zone at the beach that is covered when the tide is up and uncovered when the tide is out.
An abundance of life is found there, but it's a difficult place to live.
Conditions change rapidly.
Waves pound and the tide goes in and out ( Figure below ).
Organisms in a tide pool include a sea star and a sea urchin

Many animals in the intertidal live in tide pools.
What specific adaptations do they have to that zone?
The mussels on the top left have hard shells.
These protect them from waves and from drying out.
The sea anemones in the lower right are more often submerged.
They can close up during low tides.
Both types of organisms have strong attachments so they don't wash out to sea.
Many young organisms get their start in estuaries and so they must be adapted to rapid shifts in salinity.
Corals and other animals create limestone rock reefs near the shore.
Coral reefs are the “rainforests of the oceans.” They have a tremendous amount of species diversity ( Figure below ).
Coral reefs are very beautiful and very diverse
