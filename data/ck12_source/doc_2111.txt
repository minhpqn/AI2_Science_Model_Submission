Because the hot water or steam can be used directly to make a turbine spin, geothermal energy can be used without processing.
Geothermal energy is clean and safe.
It is renewable.
There will always be hot rocks, and water can be pumped down into a well.
There, the water can be heated again to make more steam.
Geothermal energy is an excellent resource in some parts of the world.
Iceland gets about one fourth of its electricity from geothermal sources.
In the United States, California leads all states in producing geothermal energy.
Geothermal energy in California is concentrated in the northern part of the state.
