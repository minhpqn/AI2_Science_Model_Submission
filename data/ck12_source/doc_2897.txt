Notice that more than one codon may encode for a single amino acid.
For example, glycine (Gly) is encoded by a GGG, GGA, GGC, and GGU.
Notice there are 64 codons.
Of the 64 codons, three are stop codons.
Translation is the process of reading the mRNA code in the ribosome to make a protein.
Sets of three bases on the mRNA, called codons, are read in order to select the correct amino acid for building a protein.
