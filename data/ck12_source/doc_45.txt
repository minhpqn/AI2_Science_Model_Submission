Letâ€™s explore the domain , the least specific category of classification.
All of life can be divided into three domains, based on the type of cell of the organism:
Bacteria : cells do not contain a nucleus.
Archaea : cells do not contain a nucleus; they have a different cell wall from bacteria.
Eukarya : cells do contain a nucleus.
Archaea and Bacteria
The Archaea and Bacteria domains ( Figure below ) are both entirely composed of small, single-celled organisms and seem very similar, but they also have significant differences.
Both are composed of prokaryotic cells , which are cells without a nucleus.
In addition, both domains are composed of species that reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction ) by dividing in two.
Both domains also have species with cells surrounded by a cell wall , however, the cell walls are made of different materials.
Bacterial cell walls contain the polysaccharide peptidoglycan .
Lastly, Archaea often live in extreme environments including hot springs, geysers, and salt flats.
Bacteria do not live in these environments.

The Group A Streptococcus organism ( left ) is in the domain Bacteria, one of the three domains of life.
The Halobacterium ( right ) is in the domain Archaea, another one of the three domains.
All of the cells in the domain Eukarya keep their genetic material, or DNA , inside the nucleus .
The domain Eukarya is made up of four kingdoms:
Plantae:
Plants, such as trees and grasses, survive by capturing energy from the sun, a process called photosynthesis .
