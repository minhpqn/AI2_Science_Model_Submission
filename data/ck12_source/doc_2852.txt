List three uses of solar energy.
The sun’s energy comes from nuclear fusion.
Explain why nuclear fusion releases energy.
In what form is the energy of nuclear fusion released?
How does this energy reach Earth?
What is nuclear fusion?
Where does nuclear fusion occur naturally?
Why does it occur only at extremely high temperatures?
Nuclear fusion results in a huge release of energy, yet it doesn’t involve the use of dangerous radioactive elements.
Why isn’t it used to produce power?
Conservation of Mass and Energy in Nuclear Reactions
Explain the meaning of Einstein’s famous equation, E = mc 2 .
Relate Einstein’s equation to the conservation of mass and energy in nuclear reactions.
It’s so simple that a baby can understand it!
Well, not really, but Einstein’s famous equation is pretty simple:
E = mc 2 .
Do you know what it means and why it’s so famous?
Einstein’s equation is possibly the best-known equation of all time.
There's reason for that.
The equation is incredibly important.
