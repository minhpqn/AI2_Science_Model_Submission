Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products.
Reactants and products can be elements or compounds.
Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, like the one below, in which reactants (on the left) are connected by an arrow to products (on the right).
Reactants â†’ Products
Chemical reactions may occur quickly or slowly.
Look at the two pictures in the Figure below .
Both represent chemical reactions.
In the picture on the left, a reaction inside a fire extinguisher causes foam to shoot out of the extinguisher.
This reaction occurs almost instantly.
In the picture on the right, a reaction causes the iron tool to turn to rust.
This reaction occurs very slowly.
In fact, it might take many years for all of the iron in the tool to turn to rust.
Chemical reactions can be fast or slow, like a fire extinguisher or rusting
Q:
What happens during a chemical reaction?
Where do the reactants go, and where do the products come from?
A:
During a chemical reaction, chemical changes take place.
Some chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds form.
Same Atoms, New Bonds
