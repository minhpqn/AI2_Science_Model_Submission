What percent of the atmosphere is in the troposphere in height?
In mass?
What is the temperature of the top of the stratosphere?
Why is the top of the stratosphere warmer than the bottom?
What is the temperature at the top of the mesosphere?
So does the temperature of the mesosphere increase or decrease with altitude?
If the temperature of the thermosphere is 400Â°F, and the International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere, how can the astronauts do space walks?
What causes convection in the atmosphere?
How are the layers of the atmosphere divided?
What is temperature gradient?
If you know that, then what is pressure gradient?
Describe the characteristics and importance of the troposphere.
Explain temperature inversion.
What if we took a field trip to the troposphere?
A field trip to the troposphere could start below sea level in Badwater Basin in Death Valley.
It could end at the top of Mt.
Everest at 29,029 feet (8,848m).
In other words, every human activity that's in air is in the troposphere.
You might say that your life is a field trip to the troposphere!
The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere.
