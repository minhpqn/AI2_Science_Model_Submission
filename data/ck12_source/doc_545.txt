The outside of a castle was protected by a moat and high walls.
Inside the castle, soldiers were ready to fight off any enemies that made it across the moat and over the walls.
Like a castle, your body has a series of defenses.
Only pathogens that get through all the defenses can harm you.
The first line of defence includes both physical and chemical barriers that are always ready and prepared to defend the body from infection.
Pathogens must make it past this first line of defense to cause harm.
If this defense is broken, the second line of defense within your body is activated.
Your body’s first line of defense is like a castle’s moat and walls.
It keeps most pathogens out of your body.
This is a non-specific type of defense, in that it tries to keep all pathogens out.
The first line of defense includes different types of barriers.
Being the "first line", it starts with the skin.
The first line also includes tears, mucus, cilia, stomach acid, urine flow, and friendly bacteria.
Skin and Mucous Membranes
The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens.
The skin is the body’s largest organ.
In adults, it covers an area of about 16 to 22 square feet!
The skin is also the body’s most important defense against disease.
It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside world.
The skin has several layers that stack on top of each other ( Figure below ).
