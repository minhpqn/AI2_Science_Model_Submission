Q:
Why do you think charges flow in an electric current?
A:
Electric charges flow when they have electric potential energy.
Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape.
Electric Potential Energy
Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field.
For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart.
If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases.
Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy.
This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity.
For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions.
A difference in electric potential energy is called voltage .
The SI unit for voltage is the volt (V).
Look at the Figure below .
It shows a simple circuit.
The source of voltage in the circuit is a 1.5-volt battery.
The difference of 1.5 volts between the two battery terminals results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current, between them.
Notice that the current flows from the negative terminal to the positive terminal, because electric current is a flow of electrons.
