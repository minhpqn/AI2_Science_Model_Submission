Q:
How would you draw arrows to represent the distances and directions from the post office to the park on the map in the Figure above ?
A:
The vectors would look like this:
Direction is an important component of motion.
A compass rose shows cardinal directions on a map.
A vector is a measurement that has both size and direction and may be represented by an arrow.
A vector can be used to represent both distance and direction of motion.
At the following URL, read the introduction to vectors and try the animations.
Then answer the questions below.
Compare scalars and vectors.
Give an example of each that is related to motion.
How can the direction part of a vector be expressed as a number?
Think of a short route you commonly take, such as the route from your home to a friend’s house or your school.
Describe the direction(s) and distance(s) you travel over this route.
