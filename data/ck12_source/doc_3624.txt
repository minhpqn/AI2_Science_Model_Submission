Because it forms by meiosis, the sperm cell has only half as much DNA as a body cell.
Notice the three distinct segments: a head piece, a flagella tail and a midpiece of mostly mitochondria.
What is the role of each section?
Gametogenesis may differ between males and females.
Male gametes are called sperm .
Female gametes are called eggs .
In human males, for example, the process that produces mature sperm cells is called spermatogenesis .
During this process, sperm cells grow a tail and gain the ability to “swim,” like the human sperm cell shown in Figure below .
In human females, the process that produces mature eggs is called oogenesis .
Just one egg is produced from the four haploid cells that result from meiosis.
The single egg is a very large cell, as you can see from the human egg in Figure below .
Sperm and egg
A human sperm is a tiny cell with a tail.
A human egg is much larger.
Both cells are mature haploid gametes that are capable of fertilization.
What process is shown in this photograph?
Notice the sperm with the head piece containing the genetic material, a flagella tail that propels the sperm, and a midpiece of mostly mitochondria, supplying ATP.
Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis
During spermatogenesis, primary spermatocytes go through the first cell division of meiosis to produce secondary spermatocytes.
These are haploid cells.
