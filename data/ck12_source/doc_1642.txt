Be specific.
What is needed for cellular respiration to occur?
What is ATP?
Do autotrophs need to carry out cellular respiration?
Why or why not?
How are the equations for photosynthesis and cellular respiration related?
What keeps atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide at stable levels?
Differentiate between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
Explain the purpose of fermentation.
Distinguish between alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.
How is wine made?
You probably realize that grapes are needed to make wine.
You might not realize, however, that yeast are also central in the process of making wine.
Yeast take the sugars from the grapes and convert them into alcohol through the process of fermentation.
Sometimes cells need to obtain energy from sugar, but there is no oxygen present to complete cellular respiration.
In this situation, cellular respiration can be anaerobic , occurring in the absence of oxygen.
In this process, called fermentation , only the first step of respiration, glycolysis , occurs, producing two ATP; no additional ATP is produced.
Therefore, the organism only obtains the two ATP molecules per glucose molecule from glycolysis.
Compared to the 36-38 ATP produced under aerobic conditions, anaerobic respiration is not a very efficient process.
Fermentation allows the first step of cellular respiration to continue and produce some ATP, even without oxygen.
