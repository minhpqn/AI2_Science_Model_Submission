This may include the formation of disulfide bridges or attachment of any of a number of biochemical functional groups, such as phosphate groups, carbohydrates or lipids.
Certain amino acids may be removed, or the polypeptide chain may be cut into two pieces.
Lastly, two or more polypeptides may interact with each other, forming a functional protein with a quaternary structure.
The four stages of protein folding.
A site :
Within the ribosome; binds a tRNA with an attached amino acid.
aminoacylation :
The process of adding an aminoacyl group to a compound.
aminoacyl-tRNA syntheses :
An enzyme that catalyzes the esterification of a specific amino acid to its compatible tRNAs to form an aminoacyl-tRNA.
anticodon :
A three base sequence on the tRNA molecule complementary to the codon on the mRNA.
codon :
A sequence of three nucleotides within mRNA; encodes for a specific amino acid or termination (stop) sequence.
E site :
Within the ribosome; contains the tRNA that no longer has an attached amino acid.
elongation :
The addition of RNA nucleotides to the growing RNA transcript during transcription; also refers to the process during translation of adding additional amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain.
elongation factors :
A set of proteins that facilitate translational elongation, from the formation of the first peptide bond to the formation of the last one.
