Earthworms support terrestrial ecosystems both as prey and by aerating and enriching soil.
Leeches are parasitic segmented worms
Leeches are parasitic worms.
Notice the presence of segments.
Features of Segmented Worms
Segmented worms have a number of characteristic features.
The basic form consists of multiple segments, each of which has the same sets of organs and, in most, a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion.
Segmented worms have a well-developed body cavity filled with fluid.
This fluid-filled cavity serves as a hydroskeleton , a supportive structure that helps move the worm's muscles.
Only the most primitive worms (the flatworms) lack a body cavity.
Segmented worms also tend to have organ systems that are more developed than the roundworms' or flatworms'.
Earthworms, for example, have a complete digestive tract with two openings, as well as an esophagus and intestines.
The circulatory system consists of paired hearts and blood vessels.
Actually there are five pairs of hearts that pump blood along the two main vessels.
And the nervous system consists of the brain and a ventral nerve cord.
