Renewable and Nonrenewable Resources
A natural resource is something supplied by nature that helps support life.
When you think of natural resources, you may think of minerals and fossil fuels.
However, ecosystems and the services they provide are also natural resources.
Biodiversity is a natural resource as well.
Renewable resources can be replenished by natural processes as quickly as humans use them.
Examples include sunlight and wind.
They are in no danger of being used up (see Figure below ).
Metals and other minerals are renewable too.
They are not destroyed when they are used and can be recycled.
Wind turbines use a renewable resource
Wind is a renewable resource.
Wind turbines like this one harness just a tiny fraction of wind energy.
Living things are considered to be renewable.
This is because they can reproduce to replace themselves.
However, they can be over-used or misused to the point of extinction.
To be truly renewable, they must be used sustainably.
Sustainable use is the use of resources in a way that meets the needs of the present and also preserves the resources for future generations.
Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that exist in fixed amounts and can be used up.
Examples include fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas.
