How?
Plants can't move on their own.
So how does a plant start growing in a new area?
What is a Seed?
If youâ€™ve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed, then you might realize that seeds are amazing structures.
A seed is a plant ovule containing an embryo.
The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts, harsh winters, and other conditions that would kill an adult plant.
The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant , in a resting state, and wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow.
In fact, some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years!
Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the young plant after it sprouts.
This greatly increases the chances that the tiny plant will survive.
So being able to produce a seed is a beneficial adaptation, and, as a result, seed plants have been very successful.
Although the seedless plants were here on Earth first, today there are many more seed plants than seedless plants.
How are Seed Plants Successful?
For a seed plant species to be successful, the seeds must be dispersed , or scattered around in various directions.
If the seeds are spread out in many different areas, there is a better chance that some of the seeds will find the right conditions to grow.
But how do seeds travel to places they have never been before?
To aid with seed dispersal, some plants have evolved special features that help their seeds travel over long distances.
One such strategy is to allow the wind to carry the seeds.
With special adaptations in the seeds, the seeds can be carried long distances by the wind.
