It is proper to estimate one place beyond the calibrations of the measuring instrument.
This ruler is calibrated to 0.1 inches, so we can estimate the hundredths place.
This reading should be reported as 1.25 or 1.26 inches.
This measurement is read as 1.00 inch, which has three significant figures
In this second case (sketch above), it is apparent that the object is, as nearly as we can read, 1 inch.
Since we know the tenths place is zero and can estimate the hundredths place to be zero, the measurement should be reported as 1.00 inch.
It is vital that you include the zeros in your reported measurement because these are measured places and are significant figures.
This measurement is read as 1.15 or 1.16 inches, which has three significant figures
This measurement is read as 1.15 or 1.16 inches.
This measurement is read as 1.50 inches, which has three significant figures
This measurement is read as 1.50 inches.
In all of these examples, the measurements indicate that the measuring instrument had subdivisions of a tenth of an inch and that the hundredths place is estimated.
There is some uncertainty about the last, and only the last, digit.
In our system of writing measurements to show significant figures, we must distinguish between measured zeros and place-holding zeros.
Here are the rules for determining the number of significant figures in a measurement.
Rules for Determining the Number of Significant Figures:
All non-zero digits are significant.
All zeros between non-zero digits are significant.
All beginning zeros are not significant.
Ending zeros are significant if the decimal point is written in but not significant if the decimal point is an understood decimal (the decimal point is not written in).
