Japan Tsunami, 2011
The Japanese received a one-two punch in March 2011.
The 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake offshore was a magnitude 9.0, and damage from the quake was extensive.
The earthquake generated massive tsunami waves which hit the island nation.
Waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet).
The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake.
In the photo of Sendai ( Figure below ), the black smoke is coming from an oil refinery.
The refinery was set on fire due to the earthquake.
The tsunami prevented efforts to extinguish the fire for several days.
