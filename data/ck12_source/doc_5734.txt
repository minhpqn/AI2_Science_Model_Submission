Why did John Newlands call his approach the Law of Octaves?
List some elements known since ancient times?
What properties were the basis of the triad system?
Why did Dobereiner believe that lithium, sodium, and potassium belonged in a triad?
What was a shortcoming of the triad system?
How did Newlands arrange the element?
What was a problem with the “Law of Octaves"?
triad:
In 1829, a German chemist, Johann Dobereiner (1780-1849), placed various groups of three elements into groups called triads.
One such triad was lithium, sodium, and potassium.
Triads were based on both physical as well as chemical properties.
Dobereiner found that the atomic masses of these three elements, as well as other triads, formed a pattern.
octave:
English chemist John Newlands (1838-1898) ordered the elements in increasing order of atomic mass and noticed that every eighth element exhibited similar properties.
He called this relationship the “Law of Octaves.”
