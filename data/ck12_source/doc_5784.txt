Electron affinities are negative numbers because energy is released.
The elements of the halogen group (Group 17) gain electrons most readily, as can be seen from their large negative electron affinities.
This means that more energy is released in the formation of a halide ion than for the anions of any other elements.
Considering electron configuration, it is easy to see why.
The outer configuration of all halogens is ns 2 np 5 .
The addition of one more electron gives the halide ions the same electron configuration as a noble gas, which we have seen is particularly stable.
Period and group trends for electron affinities are not nearly as regular as for ionization energy.
In general, electron affinities increase (become more negative) from left to right across a period and decrease (become less negative) from top to bottom down a group.
However, there are many exceptions, owing in part to inherent difficulties in accurately measuring electron affinities.
Electron affinity is a measure of the energy released when an extra electron is added to an atom.
Electron affinities are measured in the gaseous state.
In general, electron affinities become more negative as we move from left to right on the periodic table.
In general, electron affinities become less negative from top to bottom of a group.
