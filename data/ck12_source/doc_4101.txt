Structural Evidence for Evolution
Explain the evolutionary meaning of having a common ancestor.
Discuss how vestigial structures and embryology support evolution theory.
Why do you have a tail bone?
If you look closely at a skeleton, you might notice a triangular bone at the end of the spinal column.
This is your tailbone.
Why would you have a tailbone when you don't have a tail?
You have a tailbone because your ancient ancestors did have a tail.
These sorts of "left-over" structures support the theory of evolution.
Even though two different species may not look similar, they may have similar internal structures that suggest they have a common ancestor .
That means both evolved from the same ancestor organism a long time ago.
Common ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure of the organism as it first develops.
Some of the most interesting kinds of evidence for evolution are body parts that have lost their use through evolution ( Figure below ).
For example, most birds need their wings to fly.
But the wings of an ostrich have lost their original use.
Structures that have lost their use through evolution are called vestigial structures .
They provide evidence for evolution because they suggest that an organism changed from using the structure to not using the structure, or using it for a different purpose.
Penguins do not use their wings, known as flippers, to fly in the air.
