Two things are true of all compounds:
A compound always has the same elements in the same proportions.
For example, carbon dioxide always has two atoms of oxygen for each atom of carbon, and water always has two atoms of hydrogen for each atom of oxygen.
A compound always has the same composition throughout.
For example, all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and all the water in the ocean have these same proportions of elements.
Q:
How do you think the properties of compounds compare with the properties of the elements that form them?
A:
You might expect the properties of a compound to be similar to the properties of the elements that make up the compound.
But you would be wrong.
Properties of Compounds
The properties of compounds are different from the properties of the elements that form them—sometimes very different.
That’s because elements in a compound combine and become an entirely different substance with its own unique properties.
Do you put salt on your food?
Table salt is the compound sodium chloride.
It contains sodium and chlorine.
As shown in the Figure below , sodium is a solid that reacts explosively with water, and chlorine is a poisonous gas.
But together in table salt, sodium and chlorine form a harmless unreactive compound that you can safely eat.
Sodium and chlorine combine to form sodium chloride, or table salt
Sodium and chlorine combine to form sodium chloride, or table salt.
