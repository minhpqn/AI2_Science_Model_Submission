The bits of rock worn away by the sand still contain the same minerals as they did when they were part of the large rock.
They have not changed chemically in any way.
Only the size and shape of the rock have changed, from a single large rock to millions of tiny bits of rock.
Changes in size and shape are physical changes in matter.
What Is a Physical Change?
A physical change is a change in one or more physical properties of matter without any change in chemical properties.
In other words, matter doesn’t change into a different substance in a physical change.
Examples of physical change include changes in the size or shape of matter.
Changes of state—for example, from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas—are also physical changes.
Some of the processes that cause physical changes include cutting, bending, dissolving, freezing, boiling, and melting.
Four examples of physical change are pictured in the Figure below .

Q:
In the Figure above , what physical changes are occurring?
A:
The paper is being cut into smaller pieces, which is changing its size and shape.
The ice cubes are turning into a puddle of liquid water because they are melting.
This is a change of state.
