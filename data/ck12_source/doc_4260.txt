Both a sponge (left) and tarantula (right) are invertebrates.
Can you identify any traits they share?
One trait invertebrates like the sponge and tarantula share is lack of a backbone.
In fact, they don’t have any bones at all.
These are defining traits of all invertebrates.
Some invertebrates have a skeleton, but it isn’t made of bone.
Many other traits of invertebrates show considerable diversity.
Invertebrates have one of two types of digestive system: an incomplete or complete digestive system.
Both are shown in Figure below .
An incomplete digestive system consists of a digestive cavity with one opening.
The single opening serves as both mouth and anus.
A complete digestive system consists of a digestive tract with two openings.
One opening is the mouth.
The other is the anus.
Incomplete and complete digestive systems in invertebrates
Two Types of Digestive Systems in Invertebrates.
On the left is an incomplete digestive system, found in a jellyfish; on the right is the complete digestive system of a roundworm.
Invertebrates may have either of these two types of digestive system.
Find the parts of each digestive system in each drawing.
How do the two systems differ?
