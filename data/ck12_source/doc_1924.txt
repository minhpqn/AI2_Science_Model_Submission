Small pieces of dust started clumping together.
These clumps collided and combined with other clumps.
Gravity brought more clumps together to make larger bodies.
Gravity at the center of the disk attracted rock and metal.
Lighter material remained farther out in the disk.
Eventually, these small bodies grew to become the planets and moons that we find in our solar system today.
Since gravity pulled the heavy material inward, the inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are made of rock and metal.
The outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—condensed farther from the Sun ( Figure below ).
They are made from lighter materials such as hydrogen, helium, water, ammonia, and methane.
Out by jupiter and beyond, where it’s very cold, these materials form solid particles.
Dwarf plants, comets, and asteroids formed too.
Drawing of the solar system
The Sun and planets (note that this image is old enough to include Pluto, which is no longer considered one of the planets).
The nebular hypothesis explains the basic features of the solar system:
The orbits of the planets lie in nearly the same plane.
The Sun is at the center.
The planets revolve in the same direction.
The planets mostly rotate in the same direction.
The axes of rotation of the planets are mostly nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane.
The oldest Moon rocks are 4.5 billion years old.
