What is a compound?
A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportions.
An example of a mixture is lemonade, which contains water, lemon juice, and sugar.
How do compounds differ from mixtures such as lemonade?
Compare and contrast ionic and covalent.
Define chemical formula.
Explain how to write a chemical formula.
Identify the ratio of different elements in a compound from its chemical formula.
You can make a simple salad dressing using just the two ingredients pictured above: oil and vinegar.
Recipes for oil-and-vinegar salad dressing vary, but they typically include about three parts oil to one part vinegar, or a ratio of 3:1.
For example, if you wanted to make a cup of salad dressing, you could mix together  \frac{3}{4} cup of oil and  \frac{1}{4} cup of vinegar.
Chemical compounds also have “ingredients” in a certain ratio.
However, unlike oil-and-vinegar salad dressing, a chemical compound always has exactly the same ratio of elements.
This ratio can be represented by a chemical formula.
In a chemical formula , the elements in a compound are represented by their chemical symbols, and the ratio of different elements is represented by subscripts.
Consider the compound water as an example.
Each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
