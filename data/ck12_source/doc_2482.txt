Sketch a graph to show what the relationship between gas volume and pressure might look like.
Let the x-axis represent volume (V) and the y-axis represent pressure (P).
A:
Did you sketch a graph like the one in the Figure below ?
Let’s see why this graph is correct.
Find the point on the line where volume is smallest.
That’s were pressure is highest.
Then find the point where volume is largest.
That’s where pressure is lowest.
Whenever you see a graph with this shape, it usually represents variables that have an inverse relationship, like gas volume and pressure.
Graph of Boyle's Law
Boyle’s law states that if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure.
When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure.
Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space, because greater crowding results in more collisions.
This explains why decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure.
You can see for yourself that Boyle’s law really works.
At the following URL, simulate measuring the volume and pressure of two different gases.
Use the graphing tool to make graphs of your data.
Then answer the questions at the end of the activity to see how well you understand Boyle’s law.
State Boyle’s law.
