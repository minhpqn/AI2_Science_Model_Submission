The process of DNA replication is not always 100% accurate.
Sometimes the wrong base is inserted in the new strand of DNA.
This wrong base could become permanent.
A permanent change in the sequence of DNA is known as a mutation .
Small changes in the DNA sequence are usually point mutations , which is a change in a single nucleotide.
Once DNA has a mutation, that mutation will be copied each time the DNA replicates.
After cell division, each resulting cell will carry the mutation.
A mutation may have no effect.
However, sometimes a mutation can cause a protein to be made incorrectly.
A defect in the protein can affect how well the protein works, or whether it works at all.
Usually the loss of a protein function is detrimental to the organism.
In rare circumstances, though, the mutation can be beneficial.
Mutations are a mechanism for how species evolve.
For example, suppose a mutation in an animal’s DNA causes the loss of an enzyme that makes a dark pigment in the animal’s skin.
If the population of animals has moved to a light colored environment, the animals with the mutant gene would have a lighter skin color and be better camouflaged.
So in this case, the mutation is beneficial.
If a single base is deleted (called a deletion, which is also a point mutation), there can be huge effects on the organism, because this may cause a frameshift mutation .
Remember that the bases in the mRNA are read in groups of three by the tRNA.
If the reading frame is off by even one base, the resulting sequence will consist of an entirely different set of codons.
The reading of an mRNA is like reading three-letter words of a sentence.
