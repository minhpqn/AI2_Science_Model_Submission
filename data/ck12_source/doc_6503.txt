Emission of an alpha particle from the nucleus.
Beta (β) decay is a more complicated process.
Unlike the α-emission, which simply expels a particle, the β-emission involves the transformation of a neutron in the nucleus to a proton and an electron.
The electron is then ejected from the nucleus.
In the process, the atomic number increases by one while the atomic weight stays the same.
As is the case with α-emissions, β-emissions are often accompanied by γ-radiation.
Example of beta emission
A typical beta decay process involves carbon-14, often used in radioactive dating techniques.
The reaction forms nitrogen-14 and an electron:
{^{14}_{\phantom{0}6}\text{C}} \rightarrow {^{14}_{\phantom{0}7}\text{N}} + {^{\phantom{-}0}_{-1}e}
Again, the beta emission is usually simply indicated by the Greek letter β; memorization of the process is necessary in order to follow nuclear calculations in which the Greek letter β without further notation.
Gamma (γ) radiation is simply energy.
It may be released by itself or more commonly in association with other radiation events.
There is no change of atomic number or atomic weight in a simple γ-emission.
Often, an isotope may produce γ-radiation as a result of a transition in a metastable isotope.
This type of isotope may just “settle,” with a shifting of particles in the nucleus.
The composition of the atom is not altered, but the nucleus could be considered more “comfortable” after the shift.
This shift increases the stability of the isotope from the energetically unstable (or “metastable”) isotope to a more stable form of the nucleus.
A positron is a positive electron (a form of antimatter).
This rare type of emission occurs when a proton is converted to a neutron and a positron in the nucleus, with ejection of the positron.
