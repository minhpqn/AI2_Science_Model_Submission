What fraction of the original amount of phosphorus-32 remains after three half-lives?
A:
After three half-lives, or 42 days, 1/8 (1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2) of the original amount of phosphorus-32 remains.
Variation in Half-Lives
Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay.
That’s because they vary in how unstable their nuclei are.
The more unstable the nuclei, the faster they break down.
As you can see from the examples in the Table below , the half-life of a radioisotope can be as short as a split second or as long as several billion years.

Q:
If you had 1 gram of carbon-14, how many years would it take for radioactive decay to reduce it to 1/4 gram?
A: 1 gram would decay to ¼ gram in 2 half-lives.
One half-life is 5,700 years, so two half-lives are 11,400 years.
A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a certain constant rate called the half-life.
This is the length of time it takes for half of a given amount of the radioisotope to decay.
Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay.
The more unstable their nuclei are, the faster they decay.
