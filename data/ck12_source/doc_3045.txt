Helium is less dense than air, so balloons filled with helium float in air.
Buoyant force is an upward force that fluids exert on any object that is placed in them.
Buoyant force occurs because the fluid below an object exerts greater pressure on the object than the fluid above it.
If an object’s weight is less than the buoyant force acting on it, then the object floats.
If an object’s weight is greater than the buoyant force acting on it, then the object sinks.
A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance.
Therefore, density of an object also affects whether it sinks or floats.
At the following URL, read the short article about submarines and do the animation of a submarine submerging and surfacing.
Then answer the questions below.
What can a submarine do that a ship cannot?
How does a submarine control its buoyancy?
What is buoyant force?
Why does buoyant force occur?
Why is a heavier object more likely than a lighter object to sink instead of float in water?
Assume you have an ice cube and also a small rock that is the same size and shape as the ice cube.
Predict what would happen if you placed the ice cube and rock in a glass of water.
Explain your prediction.
State Archimedes’ law.
Explain how a heavy object such as a big ship can float in water.
