A:
You could put small objects containing iron, such as paper clips, near a magnet and show that they move toward the magnet.
An electric field is similar to a magnetic field.
It is an area of electrical force surrounding a positively or negatively charged particle.
You can see electric fields in the following Figure below .
Like a magnetic field, an electric field can exert force on objects over a distance without actually touching them.

How an Electromagnetic Wave Begins
An electromagnetic wave begins when an electrically charged particle vibrates.
The Figure below shows how this happens.
A vibrating charged particle causes the electric field surrounding it to vibrate as well.
A vibrating electric field, in turn, creates a vibrating magnetic field.
The two types of vibrating fields combine to create an electromagnetic wave.
You can see animations of electromagnetic waves at these URLs:

How an Electromagnetic Wave Travels
As you can see in the Figure above , the electric and magnetic fields that make up an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular (at right angles) to each other.
Both fields are also perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels.
Therefore, an electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave.
However, unlike a mechanical transverse wave, which can only travel through matter, an electromagnetic transverse wave can travel through empty space.
