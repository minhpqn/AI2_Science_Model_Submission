Binary fission occurs when a parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells of the same size.
Fragmentation occurs when a parent organism breaks into fragments, or pieces, and each fragment develops into a new organism.
Starfish, like the one in Figure below , reproduce this way.
A new starfish can develop from a single ray, or arm.
Starfish, however, are also capable of sexual reproduction.
Budding occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud.
The bud stays attached to the parent cell while it grows and develops.
When the bud is fully developed, it breaks away from the parent cell and forms a new organism.
Budding in yeast is shown in Figure below .
Illustrates binary fission in single-celled organisms and multiple fission in multinucleated cells
Binary Fission in various single-celled organisms (left).
Cell division is a relatively simple process in many single-celled organisms.
Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical daughter cells.
In multiple fission (right), a multinucleated cell can divide to form more than one daughter cell.
Multiple fission is more often observed among protists.
Starfish and yeasts are examples of organisms that reproduce asexually
Starfish reproduce by fragmentation and yeasts reproduce by budding.
Both are types of asexual reproduction.
Asexual reproduction can be very rapid.
This is an advantage for many organisms.
