Meet the Halogens
Halogens are highly reactive nonmetallic elements in group 17 of the periodic table.
As you can see in the periodic table shown in the Figure below , the halogens include the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At).
All of them are relatively common on Earth except for astatine.
Astatine is radioactive and rapidly decays to other, more stable elements.
As a result, it is one of the least common elements on Earth.
The periodic table
Q:
Based on their position in the periodic table from the Figure above , how many valence electrons do you think halogens have?
A:
The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group It then increases by one from left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18.
Therefore, halogens have seven valence electrons.
Chemical Properties of Halogens
The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of the halogen group.
Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to gain one more electron.
Doing so gives them a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Halogens often combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table.
Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they are equally “eager” to donate.
Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top of the group, may be explosive.
