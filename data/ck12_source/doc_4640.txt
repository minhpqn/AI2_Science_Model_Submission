If the secondary oocyte is fertilized by a sperm as it is passing through the fallopian tube, it completes meiosis and forms a mature egg and another polar body. (The polar bodies break down and disappear.) If the secondary oocyte is not fertilized, it passes into the uterus as an immature egg and soon disintegrates.
You can watch an animation of all these events and the hormones that control them at the link below.
Immature eggs form in the ovaries before birth.
Each month, starting in puberty, one egg matures and is released from the ovary.
Release of an egg is called ovulation.
