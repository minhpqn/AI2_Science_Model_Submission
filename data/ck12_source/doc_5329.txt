Four Letter Code
DNA is made of a four letter code, made of just As, Cs, Gs, and Ts, that determines what the organism will become and what it will look like.
How can these four bases carry so much information?
This information results from the order of these four bases in the chromosomes.
This sequence carries the unique genetic information for each species and each individual.
Humans have about 3,000,000,000 bits of this information in each cell; 3 billion bases in the genome .
A gorilla may also have close to that amount of information, but a slightly different sequence.
For example, the sequence 5'-AGGTTTACCAGT-3' will have different information than 5'-CAAGGGATTACT-3'.
The closer the evolutionary relationship is between two species, the more similar their DNA sequences will be.
For example, the DNA sequences between two species of reptiles will be more similar than between a reptile and an elm tree.
DNA sequences can be used for scientific, medical, and forensic purposes.
DNA sequences can be used to establish evolutionary relationships between species, to determine a personâ€™s susceptibility to inherit or develop a certain disease, or to identify crime suspects or victims.
Of course, DNA analysis can be used for other purposes as well.
So why is DNA so useful for these purposes?
It is useful because every cell in an organism has the same DNA sequence.
For this to occur, each cell must have a mechanism to copy its entire DNA.
How can so much information be exactly copied in such a small amount of time?

Protein synthesis, which is the focus of the next lesson, is also discussed in this video.
