Scientists know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas .
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere.
This leads us to a question:
Question:
Is the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere changing?
This is a good scientific question because it is testable.
Graph of atmospheric carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa Observatory
According to data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, atmospheric carbon dioxide has been increasing since record keeping began in 1958.
The small ups and downs of the red line are due to seasonal changes in the winter and summer.
The black line traces the annual average.
How has carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changed since 1958 ( Figure above )?
The line on the graph is going up so carbon dioxide has increased.
About how much has it increased in parts per million?
Answer a Question
So we’ve answered the question.
We used data from research that has already been done.
Fortunately, scientists have been monitoring CO 2 levels over the years.
If they hadn't, we’d have to start these measurements now.
Because this question can be answered with data, it is testable.
Scientific questions must be testable.
