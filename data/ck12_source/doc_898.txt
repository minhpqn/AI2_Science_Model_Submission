Extinction is the complete disappearance of a species.
Once a species is extinct, it can never recover.
Some ways humans cause habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native species of plants and animals.
Clearing land for agriculture and development is a major cause of habitat destruction.
Within the past 100 years, the amount of total land used for agriculture has almost doubled.
Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled.
Agriculture alone has cost the United States half of its wetlands ( Figure below ) and almost all of its tallgrass prairies.
Native prairie ecosystems, with their thick fertile soils, deep-rooted grasses, diversity of colorful flowers, burrowing prairie dogs, and herds of bison and other animals, have virtually disappeared ( Figure below ).
Wetlands help to filter water and protect coastal lands from storms and floods
Wetlands such as this one in Cape May, New Jersey, filter water and protect coastal lands from storms and floods.
The Flint Hills contain some of the largest remnants of tallgrass prairie habitat remaining in North America

Herds of bison make up a part of the tallgrass prairie community
Herds of bison also made up part of the tallgrass prairie community.
Other habitats that are being rapidly destroyed are forests, especially tropical rainforests.
The largest cause of deforestation today is slash-and-burn agriculture (shown in the opening image).
This means that when people want to turn a forest into a farm, they cut down all of the trees and then burn the remainder of the forest.
This technique is used by over 200 million people in tropical forests throughout the world.
As a consequence of slash-and-burn agriculture, nutrients are quickly lost from the soil.
This often results in people abandoning the land within a few years.
