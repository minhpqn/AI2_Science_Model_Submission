nondisjunction :
The failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during anaphase II of meiosis.
polygenic traits :
Traits that are due to the actions of more than one gene; often also involves interactions with the environment.
Triple X syndrome :
Syndrome that results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells;
Triple X syndrome.
trisomy :
An abnormal condition where there are three copies, instead of two, of a particular chromosome within a cell.

Down syndrome; individuals often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance.
Turnerâ€™s syndrome :

Polygenic traits are due to the actions of more than one gene and often, their interaction with the environment.
Trisomy is a state where humans have an extra autosome; they have three of a particular chromosome instead of two.
The most common trisomy in viable births is Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome).
