To make it easier for all scientists to do, a classification system had to be developed.
The evolution of life on Earth over the past 4 billion years has resulted in a huge variety of species.
For more than 2,000 years, humans have been trying to classify the great diversity of life.
The science of classifying organisms is called taxonomy.
Classification is an important step in understanding the present diversity and past evolutionary history of life on Earth.
All modern classification systems have their roots in the Linnaean classification system.
It was developed by Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the 1700s.
He tried to classify all living things that were known at his time.
He grouped together organisms that shared obvious physical traits, such as number of legs or shape of leaves.
For his contribution, Linnaeus is known as the “father of taxonomy.” You can learn more about Linnaeus and his system of classification by watching the video at this link:
The Linnaean system of classification consists of a hierarchy of groupings, called taxa (singular, taxon).
Taxa range from the kingdom to the species (see Figure below ).
The kingdom is the largest and most inclusive grouping.
It consists of organisms that share just a few basic similarities.
Examples are the plant and animal kingdoms.
The species is the smallest and most exclusive grouping.
It consists of organisms that are similar enough to produce fertile offspring together.
Closely related species are grouped together in a genus.
