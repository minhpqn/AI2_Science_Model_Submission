Describe the three steps of PCR.
Explain how DNA technology is applied in medicine.
Define transgenic crop.
Explain the purpose of transgenic crops.
Why would anyone grow plants like this?
Developing better crops is a significant aspect of biotechnology.
Crops that are resistant to damage from insects or droughts must have a significant role in the world's future.
And it all starts in the lab.
Applications of Biotechnology
Methods of biotechnology can be used for many practical purposes.
They are used widely in both medicine and agriculture.
To see how biotechnology can be used to solve crimes, watch the video "Justice DNAâ€”Freeing the Innocent" at the following link:
Applications in Medicine
In addition to gene therapy for genetic disorders, biotechnology can be used to transform bacteria so they are able to make human proteins.
Figure below shows how this is done to produce a cytokine , which is a small protein that helps fight infections.
Proteins made by the bacteria are injected into people who cannot produce them because of mutations.
Genetically engineering bacteria to produce a human protein, a cytokine
Genetically Engineering Bacteria to Produce a Human Protein.
Bacteria can be genetically engineered to produce a human protein, such as a cytokine.
A cytokine is a small protein that helps fight infections.
