Fungus Fair explores some of these dangerous but also tasty and weirdly wonderful fungi.

Many fungi protect themselves from parasites and predators by producing toxic chemicals.
If people eat toxic fungi, they may experience digestive problems, hallucinations, organ failure, and even death.
Most cases of mushroom poisoning are due to mistaken identity.
That’s because many toxic mushrooms look very similar to safe, edible mushrooms.
An example is shown in Figure below .
Toxic destroying angel mushroom compared to edible puffball mushroom
Poisonous or Edible?
The destroying angel mushroom on the left causes liver and kidney failure.
The puffball mushroom on the right is tasty and harmless.
Do you think you could tell these two species of mushrooms apart?
Some fungi cause disease when they become human parasites.
Two examples are fungi in the genera Candida and Trichophyton.
Candida are yeast that cause candidiasis , commonly called a “yeast infection.” The yeast can infect the mouth or the vagina.
If yeast enter the blood, they cause a potentially life threatening illness.
However, this is rare, except in people with a depressed immune system.
Trichophyton are fungi that cause ringworm .
This is a skin infection characterized by a ring-shaped rash.
The rash may occur on the arms, legs, head, neck, or trunk.
