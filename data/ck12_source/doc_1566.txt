There are two main types of air pollutants: primary and secondary.
Most air pollutants come from burning fossil fuels.
Some come from burning forests.
Some are due to the evaporation of chemicals.
Types of Air Pollutants
There are two basic types of pollutants in the air.
They are known as primary pollutants and secondary pollutants.
Primary pollutants enter the air directly.
Some are released by natural processes, like ash from volcanoes.
Most are released by human activities.
Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn.
Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures.
This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants.
Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine.
This happens when coal that contains sulfur burns.
Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead.
Mercury comes from smokestacks.
Both metals have industrial uses.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds, such as methane.
VOCs are released by many human activities.
