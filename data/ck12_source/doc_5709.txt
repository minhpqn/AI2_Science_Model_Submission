What was one problem with the Bohr model of the atom?
What did Heisenberg show about electrons?
What did Schrödinger derive?
What does the quantum mechanical view of the atom require?
What is a wave function?
What does a high density electron cloud suggest?
electron cloud:
The location of the electrons in the quantum mechanical model of the atom.
orbital:
The three-dimensional region of space that indicates where there is a high probability of finding an electron.
quantum mechanical model:
A model of the atom that derives from the Schrödinger wave equation and deals with probabilities.
wave function:
Give only the probability of finding an electron at a given point around the nucleus.
Define the four quantum numbers.
Determine quantum numbers for specific electrons when given appropriate data.
Seat numbers at a stadium are unique
Can you guess how many people are in this stadium?
If you attend a college or professional football game, you need a ticket to get in.
It is very likely that your ticket may specify a gate number, a section number, a row, and a seat number.
