Seasonal Changes in Leaves
Even if you don’t live in a place where leaves turn color in the fall, no doubt you’ve seen photos of their “fall colors” (see Figure below ).
The leaves of many plants turn from green to other, glorious colors during autumn each year.
The change is triggered by shorter days and cooler temperatures.
Leaves respond to these environmental stimuli by producing less chlorophyll .
This allows other leaf pigments—such as oranges and yellows—to be seen.
Deciduous tree in different seasons
A deciduous tree goes through dramatic seasonal changes each year.
Can you identify the seasons in the photo?
After leaves turn color in the fall, they may all fall off the plant for the winter.
Plants that shed their leaves seasonally each year are called deciduous plants.
Shedding leaves is a strategy for reducing water loss during seasons of extreme dryness.
On the downside, the plant must grow new leaves in the spring, and that takes a lot of energy and matter.
Some plants may “bank” energy over the winter by storing food.
That way, they are ready to grow new leaves as soon as spring arrives.
Evergreen plants have a different strategy for adapting to seasonal dryness.
They don’t waste energy and matter growing new leaves each year.
Instead, they keep their leaves and stay green year-round.
However, to reduce water loss, they have needle-like leaves with very thick cuticle.
On the downside, needle-like leaves reduce the surface area for collecting sunlight.
