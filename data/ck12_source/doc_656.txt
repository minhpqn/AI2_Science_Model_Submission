Why is it important to have values for R in kPa, atm, and mmHg?
Why do the units of R include pressure, temperature, volume, and moles?
Instruction and practice problems involving the universal gas law:
The initial pressure in a helium gas cylinder is 30 atm.  After many balloons have been blown up, the pressure in the cylinder has decreased to 6 atm while the volume and temperature remain the same.  What fraction of the original amount of gas remains in the cylinder?
Calculate the volume of 8.88 mol of helium gas at 20.0Â°C and 1.19 atm pressure.
Universal gas law:
PV = nRT
Universal gas law constant:
Two common values are 0.0821 \ L \cdot atm/mol \cdot K and R = 8.314 \ J/mol \cdot K .
