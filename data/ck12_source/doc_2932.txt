Explain your answer.
Define recombinant DNA.
Summarize the steps of gene cloning.
Can we alter DNA?
You might think that DNA is stable and unchangeable.
For the most part you are right.
However, there are new technologies that allow us to alter the DNA of humans and other organisms.
Recombinant DNA is the combination of DNA from two different sources.
For example, it is possible to place a human gene into bacterial DNA.
Recombinant DNA technology is useful in gene cloning and in identifying the function of a gene.
Recombinant DNA technology can also be used to produce useful proteins, such as insulin.
To treat diabetes, many people need insulin.
Previously, insulin had been taken from animals.
Through recombinant DNA technology, bacteria were created that carry the human gene which codes for the production of insulin.
These bacteria become tiny factories that produce this protein.
Recombinant DNA technology helps create insulin so it can be used by humans.
Recombinant DNA technology is used in gene cloning.
A clone is an exact genetic copy.
Genes are cloned for many reasons, including use in medicine and in agriculture.
Below are the steps used to copy, or clone, a gene:
