What do people use all of that water for?
How We Use Water
The image below shows how people use water worldwide ( Figure below ).
The greatest use is for agriculture and then industry.
Municipal use is last, but it is also important.
Municipal use refers to water used by homes and businesses in communities.

In this global water use chart, see how much is used in agriculture.
Why do you think so much water is used in agriculture?
Many crops are grown where there isnâ€™t enough rainfall for plants to thrive.
For example, crops are grown in deserts of the American Southwest.
How is this possible?
The answer is irrigation.
Irrigation is any way of providing extra water to plants.
Most of the water used in agriculture is used for irrigation.
Livestock also use water, but they use much less.
Irrigation can waste a lot of water.
The type of irrigation pictured below ( Figure below ) is the most wasteful.
The water is sprayed into the air and then falls to the ground.
But much of the water never reaches the crops.
