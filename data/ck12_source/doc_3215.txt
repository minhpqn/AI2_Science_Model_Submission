Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly.
This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where itâ€™s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds.
Hearing protectors help protect hearing
Hearing is the ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound.
The ear is the organ that senses sound and allows us to hear.
Damage to structures of the ear may cause hearing loss.
Total hearing loss is called deafness.
The most common cause of hearing loss is exposure to loud sounds.
Loud sounds damage hair cells in the ear that are needed for hearing.
Louder sounds damage hair cells more quickly than softer sounds.
Hearing loss caused by loud sounds can be prevented by protecting the ears from loud sounds with hearing protectors.
They keep sound waves out of the ears or reduce the amplitude of sound waves.
