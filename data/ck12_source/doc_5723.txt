Use the order of fill diagram to draw an orbital filling diagram with a total of six electrons.
Follow Hund’s rule.
Write the electron configuration.
Step 2:
Construct Diagram
Orbital filling diagram of carbon
Orbital filling diagram for carbon.
Electron configuration 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 2
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Following the 2 s sublevel is the 2 p , and p sublevels always consist of three orbitals.
All three orbitals need to be drawn even if one or more is unoccupied.
According to Hund’s rule, the sixth electron enters the second of those p orbitals and with the same spin as the fifth electron.
Second Period Elements
Periods refer to the horizontal rows of the periodic table.
Looking at a periodic table you will see that the first period contains only the elements hydrogen and helium.
This is because the first principal energy level consists of only the s sublevel and so only two electrons are required in order to fill the entire principal energy level.
Each time a new principal energy level begins, as with the third element lithium, a new period is started on the periodic table.
As one moves across the second period, electrons are successively added.
With beryllium (Z = 4), the 2 s sublevel is complete and the 2 p sublevel begins with boron (Z = 5).
