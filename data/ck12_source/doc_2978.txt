Did you ever rub your hands together to warm them up, like the young man in the opening image?
Why does this make your hands warmer?
The answer is friction.
What Is Friction?
Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching.
Friction can work for or against us.
For example, putting sand on an icy sidewalk increases friction so you are less likely to slip.
On the other hand, too much friction between moving parts in a car engine can cause the parts to wear out.
Other examples of friction are illustrated in the two Figures below and below .
