Immunity and Vaccination
In previous concepts, you learned about B and T cells, special types of white blood cells that help your body to fight off a specific pathogen.
They are necessary when the body is fighting off an infection.
But what happens to them after the pathogen has been destroyed?
Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control.
