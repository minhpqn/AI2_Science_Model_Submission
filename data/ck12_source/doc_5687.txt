Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
wavelength  (\lambda) = 620 nm
speed of light  (c) = 3.00 Ã— 10 8 m/s
conversion factor 1 m = 10 9 nm
Convert the wavelength to m, then apply the equation c=\lambda\nu and solve for frequency.
Dividing both sides of the equation by \lambda yields:
Step 2:
Calculate
620 \ \text{nm} \times \left(\frac{1 \ \text{m}}{10^9 \ \text{nm}}\right) &=6.20 \times 10^{-7} \ \text{m}\\\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}=\frac{3.0 \times 10^8 \ \text{m/s}}{6.20 \times 10^{-7} \ \text{m}} &=4.8 \times 10^{14} \ \text{Hz}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The value for the frequency falls within the range for visible light.
All waves can be defined in terms of their frequency and intensity.
c=\lambda\nu expresses the relationship between wavelength and frequency.
