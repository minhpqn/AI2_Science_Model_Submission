What "ingredients" are needed for the process of photosynthesis?
Why are producers important to an ecosystem?
Consumers and Decomposers
Explain the roles of consumers and decomposers in an ecosystem.
Distinguish herbivores from carnivores and omnivores.
Classify organisms on the basis of how they obtain energy and describe examples of each.
What is breaking down this leaf?
Notice how this leaf is slowly being broken down.
This process can be carried out by fungi and bacteria on the ground.
Breaking down old leaves is an important process since it releases the nutrients in the dead leaves back into the soil for living plants to use.
Consumers and Decomposers
Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis.
But many organisms are not producers and cannot make their own food.
So how do these organisms obtain their energy?
They must get their energy from other organisms.
They must eat other organisms, or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way.
The organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers .
All animals are consumers, and they eat other organisms.
Fungi and many protists and bacteria are also consumers.
But, whereas animals eat other organisms, fungi, protists, and bacteria "consume" organisms through different methods.
