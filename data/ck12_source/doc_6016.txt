Think about your result.
Because the coefficients of the O 2 and the CO 2 are larger than that of the C 3 H 8 , the volumes for those two gases are greater.
Note that total volume is not necessarily conserved in a reaction because moles are not necessarily conserved.
In this reaction, 6 total volumes of reactants become 7 total volumes of products.
Calculations of volume-volume ratios are based on Avogadro’s hypothesis.
Pressures and temperatures of the gases involved need to be the same.

What is Avogadaro’s hypothesis?
How much volume is occupied by one mole of a gas at STP?
In the sample problem above, assume we combust 1.3 L of propane.
How much CO 2 will be produced?
volume-volume stoichiometry:
At the same pressure and temperature, equal volumes of gases contain the same number of molecules.
Mass-Volume and Volume-Mass Stoichiometry
Perform mass-to-volume and volume-to-mass calculations involving gases.
Air bags fill using sodium azide, which needs to be calculated using stoichiometry
How much azide is needed to fill an air bag?
Cars and many other vehicles have air bags in them.
In case of a collision, a reaction is triggered so that the rapid decomposition of sodium azide produces nitrogen gas, filling the air bag.
If too little sodium azide is used, the air bag will not fill completely and will not protect the person in the vehicle.
