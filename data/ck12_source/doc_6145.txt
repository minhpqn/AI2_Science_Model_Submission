Properties of Solutions, Colloids, and Suspensions
Particle size: 0.01-1 nm; atoms, ions, or molecules
Particle size: 1-1000 nm, dispersed; large molecules or aggregates
Particle size: over 1000 nm, suspended; large particles or aggregates

Scatter light (Tyndall effect)
May either scatter light or be opaque
Colloids are unlike solutions because their dispersed particles are much larger than those of a solution.  The dispersed particles of a colloid cannot be separated by filtration, but they scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect .
When light is passed through a true solution, the dissolved particles are too small to deflect the light.
However, the dispersed particles of a colloid, being larger, do deflect light.
The Tyndall effect is the scattering of visible light by colloidal particles.
You have undoubtedly “seen” a light beam as it passes through fog, smoke, or a scattering of dust particles suspended in air.
All three are examples of colloids.
Suspensions may scatter light, but if the number of suspended particles is sufficiently large, the suspension may simply be opaque and the light scattering will not occur.
