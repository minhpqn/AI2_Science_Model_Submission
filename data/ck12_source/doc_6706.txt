Try the following simulation to apply these principles.
When hit from behind in a car crash, a passenger can suffer a neck injury called whiplash .
Explain in terms of inertia how this occurs, and how headrests can prevent the injury.
A cheetah can outrun a gazelle in a short straight race, but the gazelle can escape with its life by zigzagging.
The cheetah is more massive than the gazelle – explain how this strategy works.
If your hammer develops a loose head, you can tighten it by banging it on the ground.
A little physics secret though – it’s better to bang the hammer head up rather than head down .
Explain, using inertia.
If a man weighs 140 lb. on Earth, what is his weight in Newtons and his mass in kg?
The passenger's head will remain at rest for the split second when the seat exerts a big force on the passenger's back causing a "whiplash" on your neck.
This is an example of newton's first law because your head is not acted on by an unbalanced force while the rest of your body is.
A head rest causes your head to accelerate with the rest of your body.
The cheetah must exert a bigger force to change directions than the gazelle because the cheetah has more inertia.
This extra force needed for the cheetah to change directions allows the gazelle to get away.
The head of the hammer has more inertia than the tail.
So when you bang the hammer "head up" the head exerts a large force on the rest of the hammer in order to come to a stop.
