Do you see how they are standing on different rungs of the ladder?
When you stand on a ladder, you can stand on one rung or another, but you can never stand in between two rungs.
A ladder can be used to model parts of an atom.

Modeling the Atom
The existence of the atom was first demonstrated around 1800 by John Dalton.
Then, close to a century went by before J.J.
Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the negatively charged electron.
Because atoms are neutral in charge, Thomson thought that they must consist of a sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered through it.
In 1910, Ernest Rutherford showed that this idea was incorrect.
He demonstrated that all of the positive charge of an atom is actually concentrated in a tiny central region called the nucleus.
