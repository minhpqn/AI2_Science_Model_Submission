Covalent bonds are chemical bonds between atoms of nonmetals that share valence electrons.
In some covalent bonds, electrons are not shared equally between the two atoms.
These are called polar covalent bonds.
The Figure below shows the polar bonds in a water molecule (H 2 O).
The oxygen atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do because the nucleus of the oxygen atom has more positively charged protons.
As a result, the oxygen atom becomes slightly negative in charge, and the hydrogen atoms become slightly positive in charge.

Polar bonds in a water molecule
In other covalent bonds, electrons are shared equally.
These bonds are called nonpolar covalent bonds.
Neither atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly.
As a result, the atoms remain neutral in charge.
The oxygen (O 2 ) molecule in the Figure below has two nonpolar bonds.
The two oxygen nuclei have an equal force of attraction for their four shared electrons.

Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Compounds
A covalent compound is a compound in which atoms are held together by covalent bonds.
If the covalent bonds are polar, then the covalent compound as a whole may be polar.
A polar covalent compound is one in which there is a slight difference in electric charge between opposite sides of the molecule.
