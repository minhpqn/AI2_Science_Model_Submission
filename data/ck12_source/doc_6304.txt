The specific rate constant (k) is the proportionality constant relating the rate of the reaction to the concentrations of reactants.
The rate law and the specific rate constant for any chemical reaction must be determined experimentally.
The value of the rate constant is temperature dependent.
A large value of the rate constant means that the reaction is relatively fast, while a small value of the rate constant means that the reaction is relatively slow.
The rate law and specific rate constant are defined.
