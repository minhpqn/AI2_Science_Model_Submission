1 centimeter (cm) = 10 millimeters (mm) = 10 -2 meters (m)
1 mm = 1000 micrometers (µm) = 10 -3 m
1 µm = 1000 nanometers (nm) = 10 -6 m
1 nm = 10 -3 µm
A small cell (left), has a larger surface-area to volume ratio than a bigger cell (center).
The greater the surface-area to volume ratio of a cell, the easier it is for the cell to get rid of wastes and take in essential materials such as oxygen and nutrients.
In this example, the large cell has the same area as 27 small cells, but much less surface area.
Imagine cells as little cube blocks.
If a small cube cell like the one in the Figure above is one unit (u) in length, then the total surface area of this cell is calculated by the equation:
height × width × number of sides × number of boxes
1u × 1u × 6 × 1 = 6u 2
The volume of the cell is calculated by the equation:
height × width × length × number of boxes
1u × 1u × 1u × 1 = 1u 3
The surface-area to volume ratio is calculated by the equation:
area ÷ volume
A larger cell that is 3 units in length would have a total surface area of
3u × 3u × 6 × 1 = 54u 2
and a volume of:
3u × 3u × 3u × 1 = 27u 3
