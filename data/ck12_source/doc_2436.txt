Burning is an example of a chemical change.
Signs of chemical change include the release of bubbles, a change of color, production of an odor, release of heat and light, and production of loud sounds.
Because chemical changes result in different substances, they often cannot be undone.
Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical changes.
Chemical changes always result in new substances forming.
Physical changes do not.
