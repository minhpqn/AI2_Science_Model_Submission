Pressure Units and Conversion
A barometer measures gas pressure by the height of the column of mercury.
One unit of gas pressure is the millimeter of mercury (mmHg).
An equivalent unit to the mmHg is called the torr, in honor of the inventor of the barometer, Evangelista Torricelli.
The pascal (Pa) is the standard unit of pressure.
A pascal is a very small amount of pressure, so the more useful unit for everyday gas pressures is the kilopascal (kPa).
A kilopascal is equal to 1000 pascals.
Another commonly used unit of pressure is the atmosphere (atm).
Standard atmospheric pressure is called 1 atm of pressure and is equal to 760 mmHg and 101.3 kPa.
Atmospheric pressure is also often stated as pounds/square inch (psi).
The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psi.
1 \ \text{atm}=760 \ \text{mmHg} = 760 \ \text{torr} = 101.3 \ \text{KPa} = 14.7 \ \text{psi}
It is important to be able to convert between different units of pressure.
To do so, we will use the equivalent standard pressures shown above.
