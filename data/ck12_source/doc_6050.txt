Kinetic energy distribution curves for a liquid at two temperatures T 1 and T 2 .
The shaded area is the molecules with enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid and become vapor.
Evaporation is the conversion of a liquid to its vapor below the boiling temperature of the liquid.
Condensation is the change of state from a gas to a liquid.
As the temperature increases, the rate of evaporation increases.
Use the link below to answer the following questions:
What is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapor?
What percentage of the moisture in the atmosphere comes from evaporation?
How long does a water molecule spend in the air after evaporation?
What chemicals can be obtained from the Dead Sea?
How does temperature affect the rate of evaporation?
condensation:
The change of state from a gas to a liquid.
evaporation:
