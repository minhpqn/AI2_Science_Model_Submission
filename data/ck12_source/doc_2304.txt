Theories
Scientific laws state what always happen.
This can be very useful.
It can let you let you predict what will happen under certain circumstances.
For example, Newton’s third law tells you that the harder you hit a softball with a bat, the faster and farther the ball will travel away from the bat.
However, scientific laws have a basic limitation.
They don’t explain why things happen. “Why” questions are answered by scientific theories, not scientific laws.
Q:
You know that the sun always sets in the west.
This could be expressed as a scientific law.
Think of something else that always happens in nature.
How could you express it as a scientific law?
A:
Something else that always happens in nature is water flowing downhill rather than uphill.
This could be expressed as the law, “When water flows over a hill, it always flows from a higher to a lower elevation.”
A scientific law is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions.
Newton’s three laws of motion are examples of laws in physical science.
