Ahhhh!
A tall glass of ice-cold lemonade is really refreshing on a hot day.
Lemonade is a combination of lemon juice, water, and sugar.
Do you know what kind of matter lemonade is?
It’s obviously not an element because it consists of more than one substance.
Is it a compound?
Not all combined substances are compounds.
Some—including lemonade—are mixtures.
What Is a Mixture?
A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportion.
This is different from a compound, which consists of substances in fixed proportions.
The substances in a mixture also do not combine chemically to form a new substance, as they do in a compound.
Instead, they just intermingle and keep their original properties.
The lemonade pictured above is a mixture because it doesn’t have fixed proportions of ingredients.
It could have more or less lemon juice, for example, or more or less sugar, and it would still be lemonade.
