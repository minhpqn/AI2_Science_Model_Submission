The hammer passes the vibrations to the anvil ( incus ), the second tiny bone that passes vibrations through the ear.
The anvil passes the vibrations to the stirrup ( stapes ), the third tiny bone that passes vibrations through the ear.
From the stirrup, the vibrations pass to the oval window .
This is another membrane like the eardrum.
The oval window passes the vibrations to the cochlea .
The cochlea is filled with liquid that moves when the vibrations pass through, like the waves in water when you drop a pebble into a pond.
Tiny hair cells line the cochlea and bend when the liquid moves.
When the hair cells bend, they release neurotransmitters.
The neurotransmitters trigger nerve impulses that travel to the brain through the auditory nerve ( cochlear nerve ).
The brain reads the sound and “tells” you what you are hearing.
No doubt you’ve been warned that listening to loud music or other loud sounds can damage your hearing.
It’s true.
In fact, repeated exposure to loud sounds is the most common cause of hearing loss.
The reason?
Very loud sounds can kill the tiny hair cells lining the cochlea.
The hair cells do not generally grow back once they are destroyed, so this type of hearing loss is permanent.
You can protect your hearing by avoiding loud sounds or wearing earplugs or other ear protectors.
Did you ever try to stand on one foot with your eyes closed?
Try it and see what happens, but be careful!
It’s harder to keep your balance when you can’t see.
