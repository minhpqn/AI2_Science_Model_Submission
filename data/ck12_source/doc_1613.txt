A cell wall gives the plant cell strength and protection.
Microscope image of chloroplasts and cell walls in plant cells
In this photo of plant cells taken with a light microscope, you can see green chloroplasts, as well as a cell wall around each cell.
A third difference between plant and animal cells is that plants have several kinds of organelles called plastids .
And there are several different kinds of plastids in plant cells.
For example, Chloroplasts are needed for photosynthesis, leucoplasts can store starch or oil, and brightly colored chromoplasts give some flowers and fruits their yellow, orange, or red color.
It is the presence of chloroplasts and the ability to photosynthesize, that is one of the defining features of a plant.
No animal or fungi can photosynthesize, and only some protists are able to.
The photosynthetic protists are the plant-like protists, represented mainly by the unicellular algae.
Plant and animal cells differ in that plants have a large central vacuole, while animals have smaller vacuoles.
Plant cells also have cell walls and plastids, while animal cells do not.
