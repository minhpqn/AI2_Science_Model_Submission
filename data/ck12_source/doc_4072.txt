Two common mutualistic relationships involving fungi are mycorrhiza and lichen.
A mycorrhiza is a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a plant.
The fungus grows in or on the plant roots.
The fungus benefits from the easy access to food made by the plant.
The plant benefits because the fungus puts out mycelia that help absorb water and nutrients.
Scientists think that a symbiotic relationship such as this may have allowed plants to first colonize the land.
A lichen is an organism that results from a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism.
The other organism is usually a cyanobacterium or green alga.
The fungus grows around the bacterial or algal cells.
The fungus benefits from the constant supply of food produced by the photosynthesizer.
The photosynthesizer benefits from the water and nutrients absorbed by the fungus.
Figure below shows lichen growing on a rock.

Unlike plants, lichen can grow on bare rocks because they don’t have roots.
That’s why lichens are often pioneer species in primary ecological succession.
How do lichen get water and nutrients without roots?
Some fungi have mutualistic relationships with insects.
For example:
Leafcutter ants grow fungi on beds of leaves in their nests.
