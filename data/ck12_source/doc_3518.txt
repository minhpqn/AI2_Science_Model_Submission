The cytoplasm consists of everything inside the plasma membrane of the cell.
The cytoskeleton is a cellular "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm.
Three main cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments.
Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures and are most commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin.
Microfilament are the thinnest of the cytoskeleton structures and are made of two thin actin chains that are twisted around one another.
