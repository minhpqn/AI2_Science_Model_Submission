In hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis, in the presence of carbon dioxide and oxygen, carbohydrates (CH 2 O) can be produced:
CO 2 + O 2 + 4H 2 S → CH 2 O + 4S + 3H 2 O
Many organisms that use chemosynthesis are extremophiles, living in harsh conditions, such as in the absence of sunlight and a wide range of water temperatures, some approaching the boiling point.
Some chemosynthetic bacteria live around deep-ocean vents known as “black smokers.” Compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, which flow out of the vents from Earth’s interior, are used by the bacteria for energy to make food.
Consumers that depend on these bacteria to produce food for them include giant tubeworms, like those pictured in Figure below .
These organisms are known as chemoautotrophs.
Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and symbiotic associations between these organisms and respiring heterotrophs are quite common.
These tubeworms get their energy from chemosynthesis
Tubeworms deep in the Galapagos Rift get their energy from chemosynthetic bacteria.
Tubeworms have no mouth, eyes or stomach.
Their survival depends on a symbiotic relationship with the billions of bacteria that live inside them.
These bacteria convert the chemicals that shoot out of the hydrothermal vents into food for the worm.
Chemosynthesis is a process in which some organisms use chemical energy instead of light energy to produce "food."
