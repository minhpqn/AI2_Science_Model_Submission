The liver is an organ of both digestion and excretion.
It produces a fluid called bile , which is secreted into the duodenum.
Some bile also goes to the gall bladder , a sac-like organ that stores and concentrates bile and then secretes it into the small intestine.
In the duodenum, bile breaks up large globules of lipids into smaller globules that are easier for enzymes to break down.
Bile also reduces the acidity of food entering from the highly acidic stomach.
This is important because digestive enzymes that work in the duodenum need a neutral environment.
The pancreas contributes to the neutral environment by secreting bicarbonate, a basic substance that neutralizes acid.
Absorption in the Small Intestine
The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood.
As shown in Figure below , the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus).
Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries.
Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption.
In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court!

This image shows intestinal villi greatly magnified.
They are actually microscopic.
