Results of the Krebs Cycle
After the second turn through the Krebs cycle, the original glucose molecule has been broken down completely.
All six of its carbon atoms have combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide.
The energy from its chemical bonds has been stored in a total of 16 energy-carrier molecules.
These molecules are:
4 ATP (including 2 from glycolysis)
10 NADH (including 2 from glycolysis)
2 FADH 2

The Krebs cycle is the second stage of cellular respiration.
During the Krebs cycle, energy stored in pyruvate is transferred to NADH and FADH 2 , and some ATP is produced.
