You notice that the alarm is not set – your forgetfulness made you late.
You have used the scientific method to find an answer to a question.
Scientific Problem Solving
Humans have always wondered about the world around them.
One of the questions of interest was (and still is) what is this world made of?
Chemistry has been defined in various ways as the study of matter.
What that matter consists of has been a source of debate over the centuries.
One of the key arenas for this debate in the Western world was Greek philosophy.
The basic approach of these philosophers to questions about the world was discussion and debate.
There was no gathering of information to speak of, just talking.
As a result, several ideas about matter were put forth, but never resolved.
The first philosopher to carry out the gathering of data was Aristotle (384-322 B.C.).
He recorded many observations on the weather, on plant and animal life and behavior, on physical motions, and a number of other topics.
Aristotle could probably be considered the first “real” scientist since he made systematic observations of nature and tried to understand what he was seeing.

Inductive and Deductive Reasoning
Two approaches to logical thinking developed over the centuries.
These two methods are inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning .
Inductive reasoning involves getting a collection of specific examples and drawing a general conclusion from them.
Deductive reasoning takes a general principle and then draws a specific conclusion from the general concept.
