Reproduction in Seedless Vascular Plants
For the seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle, but the cycle is similar to nonvascular plants.
For example, in ferns, the gametophyte is a tiny heart-shaped structure, while the leafy plant we recognize as a fern is the sporophyte.
The fern's sporangia , where spores are produced, are often on the underside of the fronds ( Figure below ).
Like nonvascular plants, ferns also have flagellated sperm that must swim to the egg.
Unlike nonvascular plants, once fertilization takes place, the gametophyte will die, and the sporophyte will live independently.

In nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte (haploid) stage is the longest part of the cycle.
In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte (diploid) stage is the longest part of the cycle.
