Specific Heat (joules)
Q:
Metal cooking pots and pans often have wooden handles.
Can you explain why?
A:
Wood has a higher specific heat than metal, so it takes more energy to heat a wooden handle than a metal handle.
As a result, a wooden handle would heat up more slowly and be less likely to burn your hand when you touch it.
Specific heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of a substance.
It is the amount of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 Â°C.
Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of matter, and substances vary in their specific heat.
Metals tend to have low specific heat.
Water has very high specific heat.
