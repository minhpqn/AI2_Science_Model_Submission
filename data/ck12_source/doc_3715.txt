It had to be confirmed by other research.
In the 1950s, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase did experiments with viruses and bacteria.
Viruses are not made of cells.
They are basically DNA inside a protein coat.
To reproduce, a virus must insert its own genetic material into a cell (such as a bacterium).
Then it uses the cellâ€™s machinery to make more viruses.
The researchers used different radioactive elements to label the DNA and proteins in viruses.
This allowed them to identify which molecule the viruses inserted into bacteria.
DNA was the molecule they identified.
This confirmed that DNA is the genetic material.
The work of several researchers led to the discovery that DNA is the genetic material.
Along the way, Griffith discovered the process of transformation.

Bacteria and viruses have DNA too at
What is a bacteriophage?
How do phages reproduce?
Why was DNA labeled with radioactive phosphorus?
After the experiment, where was the radioactive phosphorus found?
What is the genetic material?
Why?
