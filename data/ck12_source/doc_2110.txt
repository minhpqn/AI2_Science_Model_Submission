Why do you think that wind power use is increasing?
Explain how geothermal energy is harnessed and used.
Why is there so much heat coming from below?
A visit to an active geothermal area is likely to be very interesting.
Some of the most active ones in the U.S. are Yellowstone in Wyoming and Lassen Peak in California.
These places are not available for energy production.
But the Geysers Geothermal Resource Area in California is used for energy.
A magma chamber deep below produces dry superheated steam.
This steam can be harnessed.
Geothermal energy stems from Earth's internal heat.
Hot springs and geysers are produced by water that is heated by magma or hot rock below the surface.
At a geothermal power plant, engineers drill wells into the hot rocks.
Hot water or steam may come up through the wells.
Alternatively, water may be put down into the well to be heated.
It then comes up.
The hot water or steam makes a turbine spin.
This makes electricity.
Pictured below is an example of a geothermal power plant ( Figure below ).
