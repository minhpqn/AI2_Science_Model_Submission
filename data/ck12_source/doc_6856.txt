How many legs does a centipede have?
You might think that centipedes have a hundred legs.
But many species of centipedes don't have quite that many legs!
The common house centipide has only 15 pairs of legs.
Centipededs and Millipedes
Centipedes and millipedes belong to the subphylum Myriapoda, which contains 13,000 species.
They all live on land, which makes sense as all those legs are more adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle, as opposed to an aquatic lifestyle.
The Myriapoda are divided among four classes: (1) Chilopoda (centipedes), (2) Diplopoda (millipedes), (3) Symphyla (symphylans), and (4) Pauropoda (pauropods).
They range from having over 750 legs to having fewer than ten legs.
They have a single pair of antennae and simple eyes.
