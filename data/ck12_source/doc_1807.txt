Spaces between the inorganic particles are large and well connected.
Sandy or silty soils are permeable, water-draining types of soils.
Soils with lots of very small spaces are water-holding soils.
When clay is present in a soil, the soil holds together more tightly.
Clay-rich soil can hold more water.
When a soil contains a mixture of grain sizes, the soil is called a loam ( Figure below ).
A sandy soil on the bottom and one with more clay on the top
Two layers of soil are shown here.
A sandy soil is at the bottom.
A soil with more clay is at the top.
Soil scientists classify soil by measuring the percentage of sand, silt, and clay.
They plot this information on a triangular diagram.
Each size particle is at one corner ( Figure below ).
The soil type is then known from the location on the diagram.
At the top, a soil would be clay; at the left corner, it would be sand; at the right corner, it would be silt.
Soils in the lower middle with less than 50% clay are loams.

Soil, the Ecosystem
We can think about soil as a living resource.
