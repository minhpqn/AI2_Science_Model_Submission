With this information, they try to understand how species have evolved over millions of years ( Figure below ).
The evolution of the horse
Evolution of the horse.
Fossil evidence, depicted by the skeletal fragments, demonstrates evolutionary milestones in this process.
Notice the 57 million year evolution of the horse leg bones and teeth.
Especially obvious is the transformation of the leg bones from having four distinct digits to that of today's horse.
Until recently, fossils were the main source of evidence for evolution ( Figure below ).
Through studying fossils, we now know that today's organisms look much different in many cases than those that were alive in the past.
Scientists have also shown that organisms were spread out differently across the planet.
Earthquakes, volcanoes, shifting seas, and other movements of the continents have all affected where organisms live and how they adapted to their changing environments.
Insects trapped in tree resin, or amber
About 25 to 40 million years ago these insects were trapped in a gooey substance, called resin, that comes from trees.
The fossils in the movie Jurassic Park were trapped in resin.
Rock Layers and the Age of Fossils
There are many layers of rock in the Earth's surface.
Newer layers form on top of the older layers; the deepest rock layers are the oldest.
Therefore, you can tell how old a fossil is by observing in which layer of rock it was found.
The fossils and the order in which fossils appear is called the fossil record .
The fossil record provides evidence for when organisms lived on Earth, how species evolved, and how some species have gone extinct.
Geologists use a method called radiometric dating to determine the exact age of rocks and fossils in each layer of rock.
