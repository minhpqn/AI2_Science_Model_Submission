Describe the electromagnetic spectrum.
Identify X-rays and their uses.
Explain why X-rays are dangerous.
You probably recognize this somewhat startling image as an X-ray image of a human skull.
X-rays, which are used to make images like this one, are electromagnetic waves.
Putting X-Rays in Context
Electromagnetic waves are vibrating electric and magnetic fields that transfer energy across space as well as through matter.
There are several different types of electromagnetic waves that vary in their frequencies and wavelengths.
Waves with higher frequencies have more energy.
The electromagnetic spectrum pictured in the Figure below represents the full range of frequencies of electromagnetic waves.
X rays lie at the high energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum
High Energy Waves
Electromagnetic waves with the highest frequencies and greatest energy are on the right side of the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure above .
X-rays have more energy than any other electromagnetic waves except gamma rays.
For example, X-rays have enough energy to pass through soft tissues such as skin, although not enough to pass through bones and teeth, which are very dense.
The bright areas in the skull X-ray shows where X-rays were absorbed by teeth and bones.
X-rays are used not only for medical and dental purposes but also to screen luggage at airports (see Figure below ).
