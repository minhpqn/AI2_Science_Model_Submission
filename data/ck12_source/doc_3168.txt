A mixture of fuel and air is pulled-into a cylinder through a valve, which then closes.
A piston inside the cylinder moves upward, compressing the fuel-air mixture in the closed cylinder.
The mixture is now under a lot of pressure and very warm.
A spark from a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture, causing it to burn explosively within the confined space of the closed cylinder.
The pressure of the hot gases from combustion pushes the piston downward.
The piston moves up again, pushing exhaust gases out of the cylinder through another valve.
The piston moves downward again, and the cycle repeats.

Q:
The internal combustion engine converts thermal energy to another form of energy.
Which form of energy is it?
A:
The engine converts thermal energy to kinetic energy, or the energy of a moving objectâ€”in this case, the moving piston.
How Energy from the Engine Turns the Wheels
In a car, the piston in the engine is connected by the piston rod to the crankshaft.
The crankshaft rotates when the piston moves up and down.
The crankshaft, in turn, is connected to the driveshaft.
When the crankshaft rotates, so does the driveshaft.
The rotating driveshaft turns the wheels of the car.
