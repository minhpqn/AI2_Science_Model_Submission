The plants used the food and so did the organisms that ate the plants.
After the plants and other organisms died, their remains gradually changed to fossil fuels as they were covered and compressed by layers of sediments.
Petroleum and natural gas formed from ocean organisms and are found together.
Coal formed from giant tree ferns and other swamp plants.
Fossil Fuels and the Environment
When fossil fuels burn, they release thermal energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide.
The thermal energy can be used to generate electricity or do other work.
The carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere and is a major cause of global climate change.
The burning of fossil fuels also releases many pollutants into the air.
Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide form acid rain, which kills living things and damages metals, stonework, and other materials.
Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides cause smog, which is harmful to human health.
Tiny particles, or particulates, released when fossil fuels burn also harm human health.
The Figure below shows the amounts of pollutants released by different fossil fuels.
Natural gas releases the least pollution; coal releases the most.
Petroleum has the additional risk of oil spills, which may seriously damage ecosystems.

Q:
Some newer models of cars and other motor vehicles can run on natural gas.
Why would a natural gas vehicle be better for the environment than a vehicle that burns gasoline, which is made from oil?
