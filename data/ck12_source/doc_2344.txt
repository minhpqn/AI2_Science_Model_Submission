He wonders whether there is enough iron in a flake of the cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet.
He thinks that the iron content is probably too low for this to happen, even if he uses a strong magnet.
Observation of a box of cereal
Cody makes an observation that raises a question.
Curiosity about observations is how most scientific investigations begin.
Q:
If Cody were doing a scientific investigation, what would be his question and hypothesis?
A:
Cody’s question would be, “Is there enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet?” His hypothesis would be, “The iron content of a flake of cereal is too low for it to be attracted by a strong magnet.”
Cody decides to do an experiment to test his hypothesis.
He gets a strong magnet from his mom’s toolbox and places a dry flake of cereal on the table.
Then he slowly moves the magnet closer to the flake.
To his surprise, when the magnet gets very close to the flake, the flake moves the rest of the way to the magnet.
Q:
Based on this evidence, what should Cody conclude?
A:
Cody should conclude that his hypothesis is incorrect.
There is enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet.
Q:
If Cody were a scientist doing an actual scientific investigation, what should he do next?
