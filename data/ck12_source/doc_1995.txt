There are underwater ecosystems and coastal ecosystems.
There are small scale ecosystems and large ones.
There are even ecosystems inside your body!
What Is an Ecosystem?
An ecosystem is a group of living things and their environment.
The word ecosystem is short for “ecological system.” Like any system, an ecosystem is a group of parts that work together.
You can see examples of ecosystems in Figure below .
The forest pictured is a big ecosystem.
Besides trees, what living things do you think are part of the forest ecosystem?
The dead tree stump in the same forest is a small ecosystem.
It includes plants, mosses, and fungi.
It also includes insects and worms.
A forest and tree stump are both ecosystems
An ecosystem can be big or small.
A small ecosystem can be part of a larger ecosystem.
Abiotic factors are the nonliving parts of ecosystems.
They include air, sunlight, soil, water, and minerals.
These are all things that are needed for life.
They determine which living things—and how many of them—an ecosystem can support.
Pictured below is an ecosystem and its abiotic factors ( Figure below ).
