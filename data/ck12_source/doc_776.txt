While both types of meters are technically resistors, they are specifically designed to make their readings without changing the circuit itself.
Diagram of a circuit with an ammeter and a voltmeter inserted
An ammeter measures the current traveling through the circuit.
They are designed to be connected to the circuit in series, and have an extremely low resistance.
If an ammeter were connected in parallel, all of the current would go through the ammeter and very little through any other resistor.
As such, it is necessary for the ammeter to be connected in series with the resistors.
This allows the ammeter to accurately measure the current flow without causing any disruptions.
In the circuit sketched above, the ammeter is m_2 .
In contrast, a voltmeter is designed to be connected to a circuit in parallel, and has a very high resistance.
A voltmeter measures the voltage drop across a resistor, and does not need to have the current travel through it to do so.
When a voltmeter is placed in parallel with a resistor, all the current continues to travel through the resistor, avoiding the very high resistance of the voltmeter.
However, we know that the voltage drop across all resistors in parallel is the same, so connecting a voltmeter in parallel allows it to accurately measure the voltage drop.
In the sketch, the voltmeter is m_1 .
Ammeters measure the current through a resistor.
Ammeters have low resistances and are placed in the circuit in series.
Voltmeters measure the voltage drop across a resistor.
Voltmeters have high resistances and are placed in the circuit in parallel.
In this video, a circuit is established with a power supply, which also has an attached voltmeter, and a lamp (resistor).
After the circuit is established, a voltmeter and an ammeter are alternately placed in the circuit.
