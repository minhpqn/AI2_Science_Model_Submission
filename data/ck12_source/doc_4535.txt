Her doctor gave her an injection of TSH and 15 minutes later measured the level of thyroid hormone in her blood.
What is TSH?
Why do you think Tashaâ€™s doctor gave her an injection of TSH?
How would this affect the level of thyroid hormones in her blood if her thyroid is normal?
Endocrine System Disorders
Identify general problems and diseases associated with the endocrine system.
Compare hypersecretion to hyposecretion.
Explain hormone resistance.
How tall can a person become?
This may be an exaggeration, but the world's tallest person, Robert Pershing Wadlow, stood almost nine feet tall when he died at the age of 22.
Is growing that tall due to a problem with the endocrine system?
Endocrine System Disorders
Diseases of the endocrine system are relatively common.
An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone.
When too much hormone is secreted, it is called hypersecretion .
When not enough hormone is secreted, it is called hyposecretion .
Hypersecretion by an endocrine gland is often caused by a tumor.
For example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause hypersecretion of growth hormone.
If this occurs in childhood, it results in very long arms and legs and abnormally tall stature by adulthood.
The condition is commonly known as gigantism (see Figure below ).
