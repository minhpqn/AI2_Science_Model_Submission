Neutron stars are the corpses of stars left over after supernova explosions.
They are the size of a small city, but can spin several times per second. (Try to imagine this in your head.) Consider a neutron star of radius 10\;\mathrm{km} that spins with a period of 0.8 seconds.
Imagine a person is standing at the equator of this neutron star.
Calculate the centripetal acceleration of this person and express it as a multiple of the acceleration g due to gravity (on Earth).
Now, find the minimum acceleration due to gravity that the neutron star must have in order to keep the person from flying off.
Answers to Selected Problems

In this chapter students will learn about circular motion, centripetal acceleration and how to think about and solve problems on centripetal forces and motion.
