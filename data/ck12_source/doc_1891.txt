Earth History and Clues from Fossils
Describe how fossils are used to learn about Earth's past.
How could there be seashells at 20,000 feet?
Shell beds are found high in the Andes Mountains.
How did they get there?
This is more evidence that Earth is a dynamic planet!
The rock that is on top of the mountains was once beneath the sea.
Due to plate tectonics, the mountains rose slowly above the ocean.
This process took a really long time.
This is one way we know that Earth is really old!
Learning from Fossils
Of all the organisms that ever lived, only a tiny number became fossils.
Still, scientists learn a lot from fossils.
Fossils are our best clues about the history of life on Earth.
Fossils give clues about major geological events.
Fossils, like the one pictured below ( Figure below ), can also give clues about past climates.
Here are just a few examples.
