Small earthquakes are fairly common in some parts of the world.
Depending on the quake, the land, and the setting, people experience them differently.
You may wonder why your chair is moving, when you are sitting still.
You may think someone is running across the roof.
In a skyscraper, you may be swaying.
Seismometers quantify this and record the energy released in the quake.
Measuring Seismic Waves
Seismic waves are measured on a seismograph.
Seismographs contain a lot of information, and not just about earthquakes.
A seismograph is a machine that records seismic waves.
In the past, seismographs produced a seismogram .
A seismogram is a paper record of the seismic waves the seismograph received.
Seismographs have a weighted pen suspended from a stationary frame.
A drum of paper is attached to the ground.
As the ground shakes in an earthquake, the pen remains stationary but the drum moves beneath it.
This creates the squiggly lines that make up a seismogram ( Figure below ).

This seismograph records seismic waves.
Modern seismometers record ground motions using electronic motion detectors.
The data are then kept digitally on a computer.
