Unlike protons and neutrons, which are located inside the nucleus at the center of the atom, electrons are found outside the nucleus.
Because opposite electric charges attract each other, negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus.
This force of attraction keeps electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space around the nucleus.
The Figure below is a common way to represent the structure of an atom.
It shows the electron as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way that planets orbit the sun.
Model of atom
The atomic model in the Figure above is useful for some purposes, but it’s too simple when it comes to the location of electrons.
In reality, it’s impossible to say what path an electron will follow.
Instead, it’s only possible to describe the chances of finding an electron in a certain region around the nucleus.
The region where an electron is most likely to be is called an orbital.
Each orbital can have at most two electrons.
Some orbitals, called S orbitals, are shaped like spheres, with the nucleus in the center.
An S orbital is pictured in Figure below .
Where the dots are denser, the chance of finding an electron is greater.
Also pictured in Figure below is a P orbital.
P orbitals are shaped like dumbbells, with the nucleus in the pinched part of the dumbbell.
You can see animated, three-dimensional models of orbitals at the following URL.
