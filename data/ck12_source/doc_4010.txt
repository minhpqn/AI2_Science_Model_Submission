Discovery and Origin of Viruses
Viruses are so small that they can be seen only with an electron microscope.
Before electron microscopes were invented, scientists knew viruses must exist.
How did they know?
They had demonstrated that particles smaller than bacteria cause disease.
Discovery of Viruses
Researchers used special filters to remove bacteria from tissues that were infected.
If bacteria were causing the infection, the filtered tissues should no longer be able to make other organisms sick.
However, the filtered tissues remained infective.
This meant that something even smaller than bacteria was causing the infection.
Scientists did not actually see viruses for the first time until the 1930s.
Thatâ€™s when the electron microscope was invented.
In 1915, English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered bacteriophage , the viruses that attack bacteria.
He noticed tiny clear spots within bacterial colonies, and hypothesized that something was killing the bacteria.
The tobacco mosaic virus shown in Figure below was the first one to be seen.

This tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be discovered.
It was first seen with an electron microscope in 1935.
