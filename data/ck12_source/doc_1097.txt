Since scientists can look back in time, they can better understand the Universe's history.
Check out to see how this is true.
Light is one type of electromagnetic radiation .
Light is energy that travels in the form of an electromagnetic wave.
Pictured below is a diagram of an electromagnetic wave ( Figure below ).
An electromagnetic (EM) wave has two parts: an electric field and a magnetic field.
The electric and magnetic fields vibrate up and down, which makes the wave.
An electromagnetic wave has oscillating electric and magnetic fields
An electromagnetic wave has oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
The wavelength is the horizontal distance between two of the same points on the wave, like wave crest to wave crest.
A waveâ€™s frequency measures the number of wavelengths that pass a given point every second.
As wavelength increases, frequency decreases.
This means that as wavelengths get shorter, more waves move past a particular spot in the same amount of time.
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( Figure below ) that humans can see.
Visible light includes all the colors of the rainbow.
Each color is determined by its wavelength.
Visible light ranges from violet wavelengths of 400 nanometers (nm) through red at 700 nm.
Visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
There are parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that humans cannot see.
