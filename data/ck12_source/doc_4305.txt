Arthropod Diversity.
Dust mites are among the smallest of arthropods.
Japanese spider crabs are the largest.
Besides size, what other differences among arthropods do you see in these photos?
Structure and Function of Arthropods
Arthropods range in length from about 1 millimeter to 4 meters (about 13 feet).
They have a segmented body with a hard exoskeleton.
They also have jointed appendages.
The body segments are the head, thorax, and abdomen (see Figure below ).
In some arthropods, the head and thorax are joined together as a cephalothorax.
Arthropod body plan
Arthropod Body Plan.
Notice the three body segments of each organism.
The arthropod exoskeleton consists of several layers of cuticle.
The exoskeleton prevents water loss and gives support and protection.
It also acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles.
The exoskeleton doesnâ€™t grow as the animal grows.
Therefore, it must be shed and replaced with a new one periodically through life.
