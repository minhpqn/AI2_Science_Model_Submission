Failure of Homeostasis
Many homeostatic mechanisms such as these work continuously to maintain stable conditions in the human body.
Sometimes, however, the mechanisms fail.
When they do, cells may not get everything they need, or toxic wastes may accumulate in the body.
If homeostasis is not restored, the imbalance may lead to disease or even death.
All of the organ systems of the body work together to maintain homeostasis of the organism.
If homeostasis fails, death or disease may result.
