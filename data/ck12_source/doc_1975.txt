Extinction is an important part of this.
If organisms never went extinct, there wouldn't be any habitats available for new ones to arise.
What could be next?
Most of the species that have lived have also gone extinct.
There are two ways to go extinct.
The most obvious way is to die out completely.
The other way a species goes extinct is if it evolves into a different species.
Extinction is a normal part of Earth's history.
Most of the organisms that have lived have gone extinct.
Sometimes large numbers of species go extinct in a short amount of time.
This is a mass extinction .
The causes of different mass extinctions are different: collisions with comets or asteroids, massive volcanic eruptions, or rapidly changing climate are all possible causes of some of these disasters ( Figure below ).

This fossil resembles a living organism.
After a mass extinction, many habitats are no longer inhabited by organisms because they have gone extinct.
With new habitats available, some species will adapt to the new environments.
Evolutionary processes act rapidly during these times.
Many new species evolve to fill those available habitats.
The process in which many new species evolve in a short period of time to fill available niches is called adaptive radiation .
