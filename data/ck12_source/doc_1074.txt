It is, of course, elevation, or height above sea level.
You can see Mt.
Sheridan in the opening image and on the map.
As you know, the surface of Earth is not flat.
Some places are high, and some places are low.
For example, mountain ranges like the Sierra Nevada in California or the Andes in South America are high above the surrounding areas.
An accurate location must take into account the third dimension.
Elevation is the height above or below sea level.
Sea level refers to the height of the ocean’s surface.
This is the midpoint between high and low tide.
Sea level can vary from place to place, but scientists base their elevation measurements on the average, or mean, sea level to make sure they have a standard reference point.
We can describe the topography of a region by measuring the height or depth of that feature relative to sea level ( Figure below ).
You might measure your height relative to your classmates.
When your class lines up, some kids make high “mountains,” while others are more like small hills!
Satellite image of California
This is a satellite image of California.
The highs, like the Sierra Nevada mountains, are rocky looking.
During the winter, the peaks are capped with snow.
The lows, like the San Joaquin Valley, are lighter and smoother.
Green indicates forest.
