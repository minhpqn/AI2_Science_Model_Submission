Rutherford surmised that electrons move around the nucleus like planets around the sun.
Rutherford’s idea of atomic structure was an improvement on Thomson’s model, but it wasn’t the last word.
Rutherford focused on the nucleus and didn’t really clarify where the electrons were in the empty space surrounding the nucleus.
The next major advance in atomic history occurred in 1913, when the Danish scientist Niels Bohr published a description of a more detailed model of the atom.
His model identified more clearly where electrons could be found.
Although later scientists would develop more refined atomic models, Bohr’s model was basically correct and much of it is still accepted today.
It is also a very useful model because it explains the properties of different elements.
Bohr received the 1922 Nobel prize in physics for his contribution to our understanding of the structure of the atom.

On the Level
As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England.
Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them.
He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have.
He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells.
He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere.
In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere.
Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus.
Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus.
Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level.
