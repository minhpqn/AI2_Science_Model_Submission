How to Contrast Biochemical Reactions Inside the Body and Chemical Reactions in the Chemistry Laboratory at
Define metabolic reactions.
What catalyzes most biochemical reactions inside the body?
What yield is typical in most enzyme catalyzed biochemical reactions?
What are biochemical reactions?
What is metabolism?
Describe catabolic reactions?
What is an example of a biochemical reaction?
Summarize the importance of enzymes to living organisms.
What is a biological catalyst?
This super fast train can obviously reach great speeds.
And there's a lot of technology that helps this train go fast.
Speaking of helping things go fast brings us to enzymes.
Life could not exist without enzymes.
Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions.
Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions
Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells.
For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes.
Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide.
