With more energy, the particles move faster.
You can see this in the simulation at the URL below.
Drag the bar to increase the temperature, and you’ll be amazed at how fast the particles zigzag around inside the box!
If the speedy particles had more room, they would spread out and the volume of the gas would increase.
Q:
Now that you know how a gas behaves when it is heated, can you explain how hot air causes a balloon to inflate?
A:
As the air heats, its particles spread out and occupy more space, causing the balloon to inflate.
According to Charles’ law, when the pressure of a gas is held constant, increasing its temperature increases its volume.
Heating a gas gives its particles more energy so they move faster.
If the speedy particles have room to spread out, the volume of the gas will increase.
Do the activity on Charles’ law at the following URL.
Be sure to answer the questions at the end of the activity.
State how increasing the temperature of a gas changes its volume, assuming pressure is held constant.
With the help of his dad, a boy in the Figure below blew up a bunch of balloons outside on a hot, sunny day.
The outdoor temperature was 26°C.
Then the boy took the balloons inside his air-conditioned house, where the temperature was 20°C.
What do you think happened to the balloons after they had been inside the cool house for a while?
Explain.
State Amontons’ law.
