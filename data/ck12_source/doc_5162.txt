In other words, a child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent.
Look at the family in Figure below .
The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them.
Instead, each has a unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents.
The children, of course, result from sexual reproduction.
Fertilization of an egg cell by a sperm cell.
In sexual reproduction, haploid gametes fuse to produce a diploid zygote.

Children resemble their parents, but they are never identical to them.
Do you know why this is the case?
Do animals always have two parents?
No, not all animals have two parents.
Sometimes animals can be made from just one parent.
This Komodo dragon, for example, only has a mother and reproduces by parthenogenesis.
Asexual reproduction is the process of creating offspring from just one parent.
Are there male and female bacteria?
How could you tell?
Remember, bacteria have just one chromosome; they do not have an X or Y chromosome.
So they probably have a very simplified form of reproduction.
