The order Carnivora can be divided into two superfamilies.
What are they?
About how many species of primates exist?
Name examples of the Hominidae.
Compare traditional and phylogenetic classifications of placental mammals.
Explain which type of classification is more useful for understanding how mammals evolved.
Assume that a new species of placental mammal has been discovered.
Scientists have examined it closely and studied its DNA.
It has wings similar to a bat that it uses for gliding.
Its DNA is most similar to the DNA of rodents such as mice.
How would you classify the new mammal?
Explain your answer.
Vertebrates.
From fish to mammals.
Obviously a tremendous amount of differences among these groups of species.
But also many similarities.
Fish had to evolve first.
Then they moved onto land as amphibians, but they still had to live close to the water.
Then they moved farther away from the water as reptiles.
Reptiles could live anywhere, and they did.
