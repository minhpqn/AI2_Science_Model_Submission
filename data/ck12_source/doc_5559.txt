One characteristic of mixtures is that they can be separated into their components.
Since each part of the mixture has not reacted with another part of the mixture, the identities of the different materials is unchanged.
A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture.
All solutions would be considered homogeneous.
