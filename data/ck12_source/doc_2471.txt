After these particles leave, the remaining liquid has less energy, so it is cooler.
This is called evaporative cooling.
A fan cools you by evaporating sweat
Q:
On a hot day, high humidity makes you feel even hotter.
Can you explain why?
A:
Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air.
When humidity is high, sweat evaporates more slowly because there is already a lot of water vapor in the air.
The slower evaporation rate reduces the potential for evaporative cooling.
Evaporation is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas without becoming hot enough to boil.
It occurs only at the exposed surface of a liquid.
Many factors affect how quickly a liquid evaporates, including the temperature of the liquid and air movement.
When particles evaporate from the surface of a liquid, the remaining liquid is cooler because it has less energy.
This is called evaporative cooling.
Evaporation plays an important role in the water cycle, which recycles Earthâ€™s water.
