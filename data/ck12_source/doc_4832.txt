Acids and Bases
Water is the solvent in solutions called acids and bases.
To understand acids and bases, it is important to know more about pure water, in which nothing is dissolved.
In pure water (such as distilled water), a tiny fraction of water molecules naturally breaks down, or dissociates, to form ions.
An ion is an electrically charged atom or molecule.
The dissociation of pure water into ions is represented by the chemical equation:
2 H 2 O â†’ H 3 O + + OH - .
The products of this reaction are a hydronium ion (H 3 O + ) and a hydroxide ion (OH - ).
The hydroxide ion is negatively charged.
It forms when a water molecule donates, or gives up, a positively charged hydrogen ion.
The hydronium ion, modeled in Figure below , is positively charged.
It forms when a water molecule accepts a positively charged hydrogen ion (H + ).
A hydronium ion has the chemical formula H 3 O + .
The plus sign ( + ) indicates that the ion is positively charged.
How does this molecule differ from a water molecule?

Acidity and pH
Acidity refers to the hydronium ion concentration of a solution.
It is measured by pH .
