The units in this expression are Newtons/coulomb times meters, which gives the final units Joules/coulomb.
Voltage is an expression of the amount of potential energy per unit charge.
The work done moving a charge against the field can be calculated by multiplying the electric field potential by the charge, W = Vq .
Example Problem:
Two large parallel metal plates are 5.0 cm apart.
The magnitude of the electric field between them is 800.
N/C.
(a) What is the potential difference between the plates?
(b) What work is done when one electron is moved from the positive to the negative plate?
Solution: (a) V = Ed = (800. \ N/C)(0.050 \ m) = 40. \ J/C = 40. \ V
(b) W = Vq = (40.0 \ J/C)(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \ C) = 6.4 \times 10^{-18} \ J
Example Problem:
A voltmeter measures the potential difference between two large parallel plates to be 50.0 volts.
The plates are 3.0 cm apart.
What is the magnitude of the electric field strength between the plates?
Solution:
E=\frac{V}{d}=\frac{50.0 \ volts}{0.030 \ m}=1700 \ N/C
The work done moving a charged particle in an electric field can result in the particle gaining or losing both kinetic and potential energy.
The difference in electric potential energy is measured with a voltmeter in units called volts.
A constant electric field can be produced by placing two large flat conducting plates parallel to each other.
