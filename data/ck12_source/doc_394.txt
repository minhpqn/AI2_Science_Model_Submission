They actually appear to the body's immune system as cells of the digestive system, not foreign invaders.
The bacteria actually cover themselves with sugar molecules removed from the actual cells of the digestive system.
This disguises the bacteria and protects them from the immune system.
As the bacteria that live in the human gut are beneficial to us, and as the bacteria enjoy a safe environment to live, the relationship that we have with these tiny organisms is described as mutualism, a type of symbiotic relationship.
Lastly, keep in mind the small size of bacteria.
Together, all the bacteria in your gut may weight just about 2 pounds.
Your large intestine is home to trillions of bacteria.
Bacteria in the large intestine have important roles, such as producing vitamins and controlling the growth of harmful bacteria.
