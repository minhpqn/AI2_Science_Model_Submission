Divide the molar mass of the compound by the empirical formula mass.
The result should be a whole number or very close to a whole number.
Multiply all the subscripts in the empirical formula by the whole number found in step 2.
The result is the molecular formula.
Sample Problem One:
Determining the Molecular Formula of a Compound
The empirical formula of a compound of boron and hydrogen is BH 3 .
Its molar mass is 27.7 g/mol.  Determine the molecular formula of the compound.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
empirical formula = BH 3
molar mass = 27.7 g/mol
molecular formula = ?
Steps to follow are outlined in the text.
Step 2:
Calculate.
The empirical formula mass (EFM) = 13.84 g/mol
\text{BH}_3 \times 2 =\text{B}_2\text{H}_6
The molecular formula of the compound is B 2 H 6 .
Step 3:
