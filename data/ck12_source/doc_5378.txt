This rare albino alligator must have the specific "instructions," or DNA, to have this quality.
Albinism is inherited in a recessive fashion.
The cause of albinism is a mutation in a gene for melanin, a protein found in skin and eyes.
Such a mutation may result in no melanin production at all or a significant decline in the amount of melanin.
You have learned that an allele is an alternative form of a gene.
Most, if not all genes have alternative forms causing the resulting protein to function slightly differently.
But are there alleles that cause proteins to function dramatically differently or not function at all?
A mutation is a change in the DNA or RNA sequence, and many mutations result in new alleles.
Some mutations have no effect on the protein, whereas others are either beneficial or harmful.
In fact, evolution could not take place without the genetic variation that results from beneficial mutations.
In humans, harmful mutations can result in genetic diseases.
There are also chromosomal mutations, large changes with dramatic effects.
See Mutations are changes in genetic information at  for a description of the early work on mutations.
It is believed that large mutations form new genes.
Mutations that duplicate large sections of DNA are a major source of genetic material for new genes.
It is thought that tens to hundreds of genes are duplicated in animal genomes every million years.
Most genes belong to larger families of genes of shared ancestry.
These gene families have domains within the protein with a particular and independent function.
These domains have corresponding conserved regions within their genes.
It is through duplication mutations that such gene families formed.
