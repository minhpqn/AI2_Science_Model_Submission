Why do we see emission lines when electrons return to the ground state?
atomic emission spectrum:
The pattern of lines formed when light passes through a prism to separate it into the different frequencies of light it contains.
continuous spectrum:
All wavelengths of light are present.
excited state:
A state where the potential energy of the atom is higher than the ground state.
ground state:
The lowest energy state of the atom.
Bohr's Atomic Model
Climbing a ladder requires energy
How does this worker's energy change as he climbs up and down the ladder?
Climbing a ladder takes energy.
At every step, you are pushing yourself up against gravity, and accumulating potential energy.
Coming back down releases that potential energy as you descend step by step.
If you are not careful, you can release that potential energy all at once when you fall off the ladder (never a good idea).
In addition, you take the climb or descent in steps.
There is no “in-between” position on the ladder – your foot either hits a rung or it hits empty space and you are in trouble until you find a rung to stand on.
Bohr’s Atomic Model
Following the discoveries of hydrogen emission spectra and the photoelectric effect, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962) proposed a new model of the atom in 1915.
