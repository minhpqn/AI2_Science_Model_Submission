Some animals migrate very long distances.
The map shown below shows the migration route of a species of hawk called Swainson’s hawk ( Figure below ).
About how many miles do the hawks travel from start to finish?
Are you surprised that birds migrate that far?
Some species of birds migrate even farther.
Whales also are known to migrate thousands of miles each year to take advantage of warmer waters in the winter months.
The great migration of millions of zebra, wildebeest and other antelope in East Africa also occurs yearly.
Each year around 1.5 million wildebeest and 300,000 zebra (along with other antelope) go in search of food and water, traveling a distance of around 1800 miles.
The route of migration for Swainson's hawk
The migration route of Swainson’s hawk starts in North America and ends in South America.
Scientists learned their migration route by attaching tiny tracking devices to the birds.
The birds were then tracked by satellite.
On the migration south, the hawks travel almost 5,000 miles from start to finish.
Birds and other migrating animals follow the same routes each year.
How do they know where to go?
It depends on the species.
Some animals follow landmarks, such as rivers or coastlines.
Other animals are guided by the position of the sun, the usual direction of the wind, or other clues in the environment.
Many animal behaviors change at certain times of day, day after day.
For example, most animals go to sleep when the sun sets and wake up when the sun rises.
