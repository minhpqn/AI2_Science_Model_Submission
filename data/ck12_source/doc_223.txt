Resolve vectors into axial components.
Resolving Vectors into Axial Components
We know that when two vectors are in the same dimension, they can be added arithmetically.  Suppose we have two vectors that are on a north-south, east-west grid, as shown below.  One of the methods we can use to add these vectors is to resolve each one into a pair of vectors that lay on the north-south and east-west axes.
Two vectors on a north-south, east-west grid, one originating between north and east, one originating between north and west
The two vectors we are to add is a force of 65 N at 30° north of east and a force of 35 N at 60° north of west.
Sum of two vectors on a north-south, east-west grid, creating a triangle for each vector
We can resolve each of the vectors into two components on the axes lines.
Each vector is resolved into a component on the north-south axis and a component on the east-west axis.
Using trigonometry, we can resolve (break down) each of these vectors into a pair of vectors that lay on the axial lines (shown in red above).
The east-west component of the first vector is (65 N)(cos 30° ) = (65 N)(0.866) = 56.3 N east
The north-south component of the first vector is (65 N)(sin 30°) = (65 N)(0.500) = 32.5 N north
The east-west component of the 2 nd vector is (35 N)(cos 60°) = (35 N)(0.500) = 17.5 N west
The north-south component of the 2 nd vector is (35 N)(sin 60°) = (35 N)(0.866) = 30.3 N north
Vectors can be resolved into component vectors that lie on the axes lines.
