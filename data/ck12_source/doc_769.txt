Electrical circuits are everywhere: skyscrapers, jumbo jets, arcade games, lights, heating, security...
Very few complex things work without electrical circuits.
Since the late 1970s, electrical circuits have primarily looked like this.
The circuits are formed by a thin layer of conducting material deposited on the surface of an insulating board.
Individual components are soldered to the interconnecting circuits.
Circuit boards are vastly more complicated than the series circuits previously discussed, but operate on many similar principles.
Parallel circuits are circuits in which the charges leaving the potential source have different paths they can follow to get back to the source.
In the sketch below, the current leaves the battery, passes through the orange switch, and then has three different paths available to complete the circuit.
