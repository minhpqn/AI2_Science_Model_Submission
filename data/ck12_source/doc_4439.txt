Contrast traditional and phylogenetic classifications of mammals.
Give examples from the orders of placental mammals.
Give sample traits from the orders of placental mammals.
How would you classify this mammal?
Obviously it is a camel, but is there more to it than that?
There are 17 orders of placental mammals.
But then these mammals need to be further classified into families, genera, and finally species.
Classification of Placental Mammals
Traditional classifications of mammals are based on similarities in structure and function.
Increasingly, mammals are being classified on the basis of molecular similarities.
DNA analyses has recently shown that the traditional orders include mammals that may not be closely related.
The most widely accepted traditional classification of mammals divides living placental mammals into 17 orders.
These orders are shown in Table below .
This classification of mammals was widely accepted for more than 50 years.
Placental mammals are still commonly placed in these orders.
However, this classification is not very useful for studies of mammalian evolution.
Thatâ€™s because it groups together some mammals that do not seem to be closely related by descent from a recent common ancestor.

The mammalian supertree classifies placental mammals phylogenetically .
It uses the analysis of DNA sequences to group together mammals that are evolutionarily closely related, sharing a recent common ancestor.
