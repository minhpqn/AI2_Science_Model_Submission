Female Reproductive Organs
The female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries ( Figure below ).
The breasts are not shown in this figure.
They are not considered reproductive organs, even though they are involved in reproduction.
They contain mammary glands that give milk to feed a baby.
The milk leaves the breast through the nipple when the baby sucks on it.

Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it in the text.
The vagina is a cylinder-shaped organ found inside of the female body.
One end of the vagina opens at the outside of the body.
The other end joins with the uterus.
During sexual intercourse, sperm may be released into the vagina.
If this occurs, the sperm will move through the vagina and into the uterus.
During birth, a baby passes from the uterus to the vagina to leave the body.
The uterus is a hollow organ with muscular walls.
The part that connects the vagina with the uterus is called the cervix .
The uterus is where a baby develops until birth.
The walls of the uterus grow bigger as the baby grows.
