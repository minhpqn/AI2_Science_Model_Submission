These two molecules go on to stage II of cellular respiration.
The energy to split glucose is provided by two molecules of ATP.
As glycolysis proceeds, energy is released, and the energy is used to make four molecules of ATP.
As a result, there is a net gain of two ATP molecules during glycolysis.
During this stage, high-energy electrons are also transferred to molecules of NAD + to produce two molecules of NADH , another energy-carrying molecule.
NADH is used in stage III of cellular respiration to make more ATP.

The first stage of cellular respiration is glycolysis.
It does not require oxygen.
During glycolysis, one glucose molecule is split into two pyruvate molecules, using 2 ATP while producing 4 ATP and 2 NADH molecules.
