Proteins produced include those needed for DNA replication.
If a cell is not dividing, the cell enters the G 0 phase from this phase.
The G 0 phase is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing.
Non-dividing cells in multicellular eukaryotic organisms enter G 0 from G 1 .
These cells may remain in G 0 for long periods of time, even indefinitely, such as with neurons.
Cells that are completely differentiated may also enter G 0 .
Some cells stop dividing when issues of sustainability or viability of their daughter cells arise, such as with DNA damage or degradation, a process called cellular senescence .
Cellular senescence occurs when normal diploid cells lose the ability to divide, normally after about 50 cell divisions.
Dividing cells enter the Synthesis (S) phase from G 1 .
For two genetically identical daughter cells to be formed, the cellâ€™s DNA must be copied through DNA replication.
When the DNA is replicated, both strands of the double helix are used as templates to produce two new complementary strands.
These new strands then hydrogen bond to the template strands and two double helices form.
During this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled, though the cell remains in a diploid state.
The second gap (growth) (G 2 ) phase is a shortened growth period in which many organelles are reproduced or manufactured.
Parts necessary for mitosis and cell division are made during G 2 , including microtubules used in the mitotic spindle.
Mitosis is the phase of nuclear division, in which one nucleus divides and becomes two nuclei.
Mitosis itself is a multi-phase process and will be the focus of the Cell Cycle:
Mitosis (Advanced) concept.
Immediately following mitosis is cytokinesis, in which the cytoplasm divides in half, producing two daughter cells, each containing a complete set of genetic material.
