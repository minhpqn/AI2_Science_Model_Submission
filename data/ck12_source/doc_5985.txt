A very common example is the reactions of oxides with water.
Calcium oxide reacts readily with water to produce an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide.
\text{CaO}(s)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{Ca(OH)}_2(aq)
Sulfur trioxide gas reacts with water to form sulfuric acid.
This is an unfortunately common reaction that occurs in the atmosphere in some places where oxides of sulfur are present as pollutants.
The acid formed in the reaction falls to the ground as acid rain.
\text{SO}_3(g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4(aq)
Acid rain degrades marble statues and kills trees
Acid rain has severe consequences on both natural and man-made objects.
Acid rain degrades marble statues like the one on the left (A).
The trees in the forest on the right (B) have been killed by acid rain.
Combination reactions occur when two or more substances combine to form a new substance.

What are combination reactions?
Write the product of the following reaction: \text{Mg} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow
Is \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} a combination reaction?
Explain your answer.
combination reaction:
A reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a single new substance.
Define decomposition reaction.
