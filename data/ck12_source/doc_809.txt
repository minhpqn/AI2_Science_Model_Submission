Limiting factors include a low food supply and lack of space.
Limiting factors can lower birth rates, increase death rates, or lead to emigration.
When organisms face limiting factors, they show logistic growth (S-shaped curve, curve B:
Figure below ).
Competition for resources like food and space cause the growth rate to stop increasing, so the population levels off.
This flat upper line on a growth curve is the carrying capacity.
The carrying capacity (K) is the maximum population size that can be supported in a particular area without destroying the habitat.
Limiting factors determine the carrying capacity of a population.
Recall that when there are no limiting factors, the population grows exponentially.
In exponential growth (J-shaped curve, curve A:
Figure below ), as the population size increases, the growth rate also increases.
Organisms show exponential growth in the absence of limiting factors, while they show logistic growth in the presence of limiting factors
Exponential and Logistic Growth.
Curve A shows exponential growth.
Curve B shows logistic growth.
Notice that the carrying capacity (K) is also shown.
Food Supply as Limiting Factor
If there are 12 hamburgers at a lunch table and 24 people sit down at a lunch table, will everyone be able to eat?
At first, maybe you will split hamburgers in half, but if more and more people keep coming to sit at the lunch table, you will not be able to feed everyone.
This is what happens in nature.
