Molecular Biology and Genetics
Why is heredity so important?
Genetics is the study of inheritance.
Inheritance is the passing of traits from parents to offspring.
How are these traits "passed"?
Through DNA, which is the genetic material of all organisms.
This concept will focus on genetics, inheritance, and DNA.
DNA, the Genetic Material
Explain the importance of DNA.
Define and describe a nucleotide.
Describe the shape of DNA.
Summarize the base-pairing rules.
Where's the instructions?
How do your cells know what to do?
Just like builders have blueprints to tell them how to build a house, your cells also have instructions.
Your cells' instructions are molecules of DNA.
What is DNA?
DNA is the material that makes up our chromosomes and stores our genetic information.
When you build a house, you need a blueprint, a set of instructions that tells you how to build.
The DNA is like the blueprint for living organisms.
