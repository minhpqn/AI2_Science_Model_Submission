Like other planets, it is nearly round.
This is because it has enough mass for its gravity to pull material into a round shape.
Earth's gravity has also pulled in small objects, like asteroids.
So the planet's orbit is cleared.
Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around its star.
As a result of its rotation, Earth has a day-night cycle.
The tilt of its axis creates the seasons.
Earth has layers from crust to mantle to core.
The core is divided into a liquid outer core and a solid inner core.
The liquid outer core has convection, which generates the magnetic field.
The mantle is solid rock.
The crust has two major types: continental and oceanic.
The crust and uppermost mantle make up the lithosphere.
Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere.
The lithosphere is brittle and will break.
The asthenosphere can flow.
