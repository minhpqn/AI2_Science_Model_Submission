Some types of matter offer more or less resistance to electric current than others.
Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors .
Many metals—including copper, aluminum, and steel—are good conductors of electricity.
The outer electrons of metal atoms are loosely bound and free to move, allowing electric current to flow.
Water that has even a tiny amount of impurities is an electric conductor as well.
Q:
What do you think lightning rods are made of?
A:
Lightning rods are made of metal, usually copper or aluminum, both of which are excellent conductors of electricity.
Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators .
Examples include most nonmetallic solids, such as wood, rubber, and plastic.
Their atoms hold onto their electrons tightly, so electric current cannot flow freely through them.
Dry air is also an electric insulator.

Q:
You may have heard that rubber-soled shoes will protect you if you are struck by lightning.
Do you think this is true?
Why or why not?
A:
It isn’t true.
