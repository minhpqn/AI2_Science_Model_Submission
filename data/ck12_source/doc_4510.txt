It is divided into two hemispheres, or halves.
The hemispheres are very similar but not identical to one another.
They are connected by a thick bundle of axons deep within the brain.
Each hemisphere is further divided into the four lobes shown in Figure below .
The cerebellum is just below the cerebrum.
It coordinates body movements.
Many nerve pathways link the cerebellum with motor neurons throughout the body.
The brain stem is the lowest part of the brain.
It connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord and passes nerve impulses between the brain and spinal cord.
It also controls unconscious functions such as heart rate and breathing.
Each hemisphere of the cerebrum consists of four parts, called lobes.
Each lobe is associated with particular brain functions.
Just one function of each lobe is listed here.
The spinal cord is a thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue that extends from the brainstem and continues down the center of the back to the pelvis.
It is protected by the vertebrae , which encase it.
The spinal cord serves as an information superhighway, passing messages from the body to the brain and from the brain to the body.
Humanoid Robot Brains
The smartest people in the world have spent millions of dollars on developing high-tech robots.
But even though technology has come a long way, these humanoid robots are nowhere close to having the "brain" and motor control of a human.
Why is that?
