Titin is a protein.
You can tell because it contains sulfur, and proteins are the only biochemical compounds that contain this element.
Biochemical compounds are carbon-based compounds that are found in living things.
The similarity in biochemical compounds between living things provides evidence for the evolution of species from common ancestors.
All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon.
They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur.
Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers.
Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules, meaning that they are very large.
Some contain thousands of monomer molecules.
Although there are millions of biochemical compounds, all of them can be grouped into just four classes: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.
