Newton’s law allowed scientists to understand many different phenomena.
It explains not only why things always fall down toward the ground or roll downhill.
It also explains the motion of many other objects.
For example, it explains why planets orbit the sun.
The idea of universal gravity even helped scientists discover the planets Neptune and Pluto.
The caption and diagram in the Figure below explain how.
The Solar System
In the early 1800s, astronomers noticed a wobble in Uranus’ orbit around the sun.
They predicted that the wobble was caused by the pull of gravity of another, not-yet-discovered planet.
Scientists searched the skies for the “missing” planet.
When they discovered Neptune in 1846, they thought they had found their missing planet.
After the astronomers took into account the effects of Neptune’s gravity, they saw that Uranus still had an unexplained wobble.
They predicted that there must be another planet beyond Neptune.
That planet, now called Pluto, was finally discovered in 1930.
Of special note, as of 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) demoted Pluto from its planet status as it does not meet one of the criteria for planetary standards.

Baby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually accumulate.
The accumulating evidence lets scientists refine and expand on earlier ideas.
For example, the scientific idea of the atom was introduced in the early 1800s.
But scientists came to understand the structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two centuries.
