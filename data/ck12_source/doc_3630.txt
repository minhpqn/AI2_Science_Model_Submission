Explain your response.
What is crossing-over and when does it occur?
Describe how crossing-over, independent assortment, and random fertilization lead to genetic variation.
How many combinations of chromosomes are possible from sexual reproduction in humans?
Create a diagram to show how crossing-over occurs and how it creates new gene combinations on each chromosome.
Reproductive Life Cycles
Define life cycle.
Identify different types of sexual life cycles.
Distinguish a haploid life cycle from a diploid life cycle.
Summarize an alternation of generations life cycle.
Indicate the significance of a spore.
Young to old.
A life cycle?
Not in the biological sense.
Life cycles describe the amount of DNA present at a specific stage or time in the life of an organism.
Is there a haploid or diploid amount of DNA?
That is the key question.
Sexual reproduction occurs in a cycle.
Diploid parents produce haploid gametes that unite and develop into diploid adults, which repeat the cycle.
This series of life stages and events that a sexually reproducing organism goes through is called its life cycle .
