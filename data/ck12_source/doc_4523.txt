Nervous tissue may become infected by microorganisms.
Meningitis , for example, is caused by a viral or bacterial infection of the tissues covering the brain.
This may cause the brain to swell and lead to brain damage and death.
Encephalitis  is a brain infection  most often caused by viruses.
The immune system tries to fight off a brain infection, just as it tries to fight off other infections.
But sometimes this can do more harm than good.
The immune system’s response may cause swelling in the brain.
With no room to expand, the brain pushes against the skull.
This may injure the brain and even cause death.
Medicines can help fight some viral infections of the brain, but not all infections.
Brain or spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis and other disabilities.
Injuries to peripheral nerves can cause localized pain or numbness.
Abnormal brain functions can occur for a variety of reasons.
Examples include headaches, such as migraine headaches, and epilepsy, in which seizures occur.
Nervous tissue may degenerate, or break down.
Alzheimer’s disease is an example of this type of disorder, as is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , or ALS.
ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
It leads to a gradual loss of higher brain functions.

In addition to ALS and Alzheimer's disease,  other serious nervous system diseases include multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.
