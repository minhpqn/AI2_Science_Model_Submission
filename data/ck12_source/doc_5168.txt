Sexual vs, Asexual.
What's the main difference?
Truly, it's just that sexual reproduction is the combining of sex cells from two parents, each providing half the amount of genetic material.
Why do you look similar to your parents, but not identical?
First, it is because you have two parents.
Second, it is because of sexual reproduction.
Whereas asexual reproduction produces genetically identical clones, sexual reproduction produces genetically diverse individuals.
Sexual reproduction is the creation of a new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms.
As both parents contribute half of the new organism’s genetic material, the offspring will have traits of both parents, but will not be exactly like either parent.
Organisms that reproduce sexually by joining gametes , a process known as fertilization , must have a mechanism to produce haploid gametes.
This mechanism is meiosis , a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes.
Meiosis occurs only in gamete producing cells within the gonads.
During meiosis the pairs of chromosomes separate and segregate randomly to produce gametes with one chromosome from each pair.
Meiosis involves two nuclear and cell divisions without an interphase in between, starting with one diploid cell and generating four haploid cells ( Figure below ).
Each division, named meiosis I and meiosis II, has four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
These stages are similar to those of mitosis, but there are distinct and important differences.
Prior to meiosis, the cell’s DNA is replicated, generating chromosomes with two sister chromatids.
A human cell prior to meiosis will have 46 chromosomes, 22 pairs of homologous autosomes, and 1 pair of sex chromosomes.
Homologous chromosomes , or homologues, are similar in size, shape, and genetic content; they contain the same genes, though they may have different alleles of those genes.
The genes/alleles are at the same loci on homologous chromosomes.
