Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products.
In some chemical reactions, called exothermic reactions, more energy is released when new bonds form in the products than is needed to break bonds in the reactants.
The opposite is true of endothermic reactions.
In an endothermic reaction , it takes more energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products.
Energy Change in Endothermic Reactions
The word endothermic literally means “taking in heat.” A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed to keep an endothermic reaction going.
This is illustrated in the Figure below .
Energy must be constantly added because not enough energy is released when the products form to break more bonds in the reactants.
The general equation for an endothermic reaction is:
Reactants + Energy → Products
Change in energy of an endothermic reaction
Note: ΔH represents the change in energy.
In endothermic reactions, the temperature of the products is typically lower than the temperature of the reactants.
The drop in temperature may be great enough to cause liquids to freeze.
That’s what happens in the endothermic reaction at this URL:
Q:
Now can you guess how an instant cold pack works?
A:
Squeezing the cold pack breaks an inner bag of water, and the water mixes with a chemical inside the pack.
The chemical and water combine in an endothermic reaction.
