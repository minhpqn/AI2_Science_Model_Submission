Look again at the five pulley systems to ensure this is true.
A pulley system
Example Problem:   Consider the pulley system sketched above.  Given that the resistance force is 8500.
N, find
(a) the IMA.
(b) the ideal effort force required to list this weight.
(c) the distance the weight will rise if the effort force moves 1.0 m.
(d) the AMA if the actual effort force is 2000.
N.
(a) Since the effort strand moves in the opposite direction of the resistance, it is not a supporting strand.  Therefore, there are 5 supporting strands and that makes the IMA = 5.
(b) \text{Effort force}=\frac{\text{resistance force}}{\text{IMA}}=\frac{8500 \ \text{N}}{5}=1700 \ \text{N}
(c) Since the IMA is 5, the resistance distace will be 1/5 of the effort distance: the resistance distance is 1.0m/5 = 0.20 m
(d) \text{AMA}=\frac{\text{resistance force}}{\text{effort force}}=\frac{8500 \ \text{N}}{2000 \ \text{N}}=4.25
Wheel and Axle
Just like it sounds, a  wheel and axle  is composed of two connected cylinders of different diameters.
Since the wheel has a larger radius (distance) than the axle, the axle will always have a larger force than the wheel.
The ideal mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle is dependent on the ratio between the radii:
An inclined plane is also a simple machine.
The resistance is the weight of the box resting on the inclined plane.
In order to lift this box straight up, the effort force would need to be equal to its weight.
