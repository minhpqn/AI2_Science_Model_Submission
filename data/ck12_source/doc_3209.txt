To answer this question, you need to know more about sound, the ear, and how we hear.
The Sounds We Hear
Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter.
The ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound is called hearing .
The organ that we use to sense sound energy is the ear.
Almost all the structures in the ear are needed for this purpose.
Together, they gather sound waves, amplify the waves, and change their kinetic energy to electrical signals.
The electrical signals travel to the brain, which interprets them as the sounds we hear.
