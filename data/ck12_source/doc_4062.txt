Their mode of nutrition defines the role of fungi in their environment.
Fungi obtain nutrients in three different ways:
They decompose dead organic matter.
A saprotroph is an organism that obtains its nutrients from non-living organic matter, usually dead and decaying plant or animal matter, by absorbing soluble organic compounds.
Saprotrophic fungi play very important roles as recyclers in ecosystem energy flow and biogeochemical cycles.
Saprophytic fungi, such as shiitake ( Lentinula edodes ) and oyster mushrooms ( Pleurotus ostreatus ), decompose dead plant and animal tissue by releasing enzymes from hyphal tips.
In this way they recycle organic materials back into the surrounding environment.
Because of these abilities, fungi are the primary decomposers in forests (see Figure below ).
They feed on living hosts.
As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host.
Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host.
Disease-causing fungi are parasitic.
Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed.
They live mutualistically with other organisms.
Mutualistic fungi live harmlessly with other living organisms.
Recall that mutualism is an interaction between individuals of two different species, in which both individuals benefit.
Both parasitism and mutualism are classified as symbiotic relationships, but they are discussed separately here because of the different effect on the host.
Forest decomposers perform an important job
Forest Decomposers.
These forest mushrooms may look fragile, but they do a powerful job.
