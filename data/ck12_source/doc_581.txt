After they come together, they will develop into a human being.
How does a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells?

Sexual reproduction happens when a sperm and an egg cell combine together.
This is called fertilization .
Sperm are released into the vagina during sexual intercourse.
They “swim” through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube .
This is where fertilization normally takes place.
A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below ( Figure below ).
If the sperm breaks through the egg’s membrane, it will immediately cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out.
This ensures that only a single sperm can penetrate an egg.
It will also cause the egg to go through meiosis.
Recall that meiosis , cell division that creates the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary.
In fact, it begins prior to birth.
The egg is much larger than the sperm because the egg contributes all the cytoplasm and organelles to the zygote
This sperm is ready to penetrate the membrane of this egg.
Notice the difference in size of the sperm and egg.
Why is the egg so much larger?
The egg contributes all the cytoplasm and organelles to the zygote.
The sperm only contributes one set of chromosomes.
