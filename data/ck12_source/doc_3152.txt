The land heats up and cools off faster than the water because it has lower specific heat.
Therefore, the land gets warmer during the day and cooler at night than the water does.
During the day, warm air rises above the land and cool air from the water moves in to take its place.
During the night, the opposite happens.
Warm air rises above the water and cool air from the land moves out to take its place.

Q:
During the day, in which direction is thermal energy of the air transferred?
In which direction is it transferred during the night?
A:
During the day, thermal energy is transferred from the air over the land to the air over the water.
During the night, thermal energy is transferred in the opposite direction.
Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a fluid.
Thermal energy is always transferred from an area with a higher temperature to an area with a lower temperature.
Moving particles transfer thermal energy through a fluid by forming convection currents.
Convection currents move thermal energy through many fluids, including molten rock inside Earth, water in the oceans, and air in the atmosphere.
