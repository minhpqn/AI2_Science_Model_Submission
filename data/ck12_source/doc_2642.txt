At the following URL, do the online learning activity on chemical formulas.
Then take the quiz at the end of the activity to check your comprehension.
Complete the following analogy:
A chemical symbol is to an element as a chemical formula is to a(n) __________.
The compound sodium sulfide consists of a ratio of one sodium ion (Na + ) to two sulfide ions (S 2- ).
Write the chemical formula for this compound.
A molecule of sulfur dioxide consists of one sulfur atom (S) and two oxygen atoms (O).
What is the chemical formula for this compound?
Identify the ratio of atoms in the compound represented by the following chemical formula:
N 2 O 5 .
State how ionic bonds form.
Explain why ionic bonds form.
Describe the role of energy in the formation of ionic bonds.
Look at the photos of bar magnets in the opening image.
At first glance, the two photos look very similar, but they differ in one important way.
In the top photo, the north (blue) poles of both magnets are placed close together.
In the bottom photo, the north pole of one magnet is placed close to the south (red) pole of the other magnet.
Now look closely at the iron filings in the two photos.
The ion filings show the force of repulsion between the two north poles in the top photo and the force of attraction between the north and south poles in the bottom photo.
Like the poles of magnets, electric charges repel or attract each other.
