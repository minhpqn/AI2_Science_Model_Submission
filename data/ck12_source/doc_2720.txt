Concentration of Reactants
Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume.
When the concentration of reactants is higher, the reaction rate is faster.
At higher concentrations, particles of reactants are crowded closer together, so they are more likely to collide and react.
Did you ever see a sign like the one in the Figure below ?
You might see it where someone is using a tank of pure oxygen for a breathing problem.
Combustion, or burning, is a chemical reaction in which oxygen is a reactant.
A greater concentration of oxygen in the air makes combustion more rapid if a fire starts burning.
No smoking sign
Q:
It is dangerous to smoke or use open flames when oxygen is in use.
Can you explain why?
A:
Because of the higher-than-normal concentration of oxygen, the flame of a match, lighter, or cigarette could spread quickly to other materials or even cause an explosion.
Surface Area of Reactants
When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants.
If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react.
Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate.
Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below .
