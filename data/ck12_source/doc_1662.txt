Each division can be divided into the same phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
Cytokinesis follows telophase each time.
Between the two cell divisions, DNA replication does not occur.
Through this process, one diploid cell will divide into four haploid cells.
Overview of Meiosis
Overview of Meiosis.
During meiosis, four haploid cells are created from one diploid parent cell.
During meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated from each other.
This requires that they line up in their homologous paris during metaphase I.
The steps are outlined below:
Prophase I:
The homologous chromosomes line up together.
During this time, a process that only happens in meiosis can occur.
This process is called crossing-over ( Figure below ), which is the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes.
Crossing-over forms new combinations of alleles on the resulting chromosome.
Without crossing-over, the offspring would always inherit all of the alleles on one of the homologous chromosomes.
Also during prophase I, the spindle forms, the chromosomes condense as they coil up tightly, and the nuclear envelope disappears.
Metaphase I:
The homologous chromosomes line up in their pairs in the middle of the cell.
Chromosomes from the mother or from the father can each attach to either side of the spindle.
