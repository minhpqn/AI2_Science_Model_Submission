Explain these effects in terms of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases.
The pressure in a basketball in a game must be kept in a certain range
How high does a basketball bounce?
The pressure of the air in a basketball has to be adjusted so that the ball bounces to the correct height.
Before a game, the officials check the ball by dropping it from shoulder height and seeing how far back up it bounces.
What would the official do if the ball did not bounce up as far as it is supposed to?
What would he do if it bounced too high?
The pressure inside a container is dependent on the amount of gas inside the container.
If the basketball does not bounce high enough, the official could remedy the situation by using a hand pump and adding more air to the ball.
Conversely, if it bounces too high, he could let some air out of the ball.
Factors Affecting Gas Pressure
Recall from the kinetic-molecular theory that gas particles move randomly and in straight lines until they elastically collide with either other gas particles or with one of the walls of the container.
It is these collisions with the walls of the container that defines the pressure of the gas.
Four variables are used to describe the condition of a gas.
They are pressure (P) , volume (V) , temperature (T) , and the amount of the gas as measured by the number moles (n) .
We will examine separately how the volume, temperature, and amount of gas each affect the pressure of an enclosed gas sample.
Amount of Gas
The Figure below shows what happens when air is added to a rigid container .
A rigid container is one that is incapable of expanding or contracting.
A steel canister is an example of a rigid container.
