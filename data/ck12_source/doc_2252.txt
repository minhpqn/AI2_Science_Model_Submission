We have a main sequence star nearby.
Our Sun is on the main sequence, classified as a yellow dwarf.
Our Sun has been a main sequence star for about 5 billion years.
As a medium-sized star, it will continue to shine for about 5 billion more years.
Most stars are on the main sequence.
Main Sequence Stars
For most of a star’s life, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium atoms.
A star like this is a main sequence star .
The hotter a main sequence star is, the brighter it is.
A star remains on the main sequence as long as it is fusing hydrogen to form helium.
Classifying Stars by Color
The most common way of classifying main sequence stars is by color ( Table below ).
Each class of star is given a letter, a color, and a range of temperatures.
The letters don’t match the color names because stars were first grouped as A through O.
It wasn't until later that their order was corrected to go by increasing temperature.
When you try to remember the order, you can use this phrase: “Oh Be A Fine Good Kid, Man.”

The surface temperature of most stars is due to their size.
Bigger stars produce more energy, so their surfaces are hotter.
But some very small stars are very hot.
