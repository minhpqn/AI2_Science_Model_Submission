What is the difference between a polar bond and a polar molecule?
dipole:
A molecule with two poles.
polar molecule:
A molecule in which one end of the molecule is slightly positive, while the other end is slightly negative.

NMR machines use liquid nitrogen, which has Van der Waals forces
How to Keep it Cool?
Magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) devices use liquid nitrogen to cool the superconducting magnets.  Nitrogen is a gas at room temperature and liquefies at -195.8°C.  Its neighbor on the periodic table (oxygen) boils at -182.95°C.  The interactions between nitrogen molecules (N 2 ) are weaker, so the boiling point is lower.
Interactions between non-polar molecules depend on the degree of electron fluctuation within the molecule.
Van der Waals Forces
The first type of intermolecular force we will consider are called van der Waals forces, after Dutch chemist Johannes van der Waals (1837-1923).  Van der Waals forces are the weakest intermolecular force and consist of dipole-dipole forces and dispersion forces.
Dipole-dipole forces are the attractive forces that occur between polar molecules.  A molecule of hydrogen chloride has a partially positive hydrogen atom and a partially negative chlorine atom.  In a collection of many hydrogen chloride molecules, they will align themselves so that the oppositely charged regions of neighboring molecules are near each other.
Example of a dipole-dipole force
Dipole-dipole forces are a result of the attraction of the positive end of one dipole to the negative end of a neighboring dipole.
Dipole-dipole forces are similar in nature, but much weaker than ionic bonds.
