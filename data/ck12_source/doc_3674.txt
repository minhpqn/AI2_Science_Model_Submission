Polygenic characteristics are controlled by more than one gene, and each gene may have two or more alleles.
The genes may be on the same chromosome or on nonhomologous chromosomes.
If the genes are located close together on the same chromosome, they are likely to be inherited together.
However, it is possible that they will be separated by crossing-over during meiosis, in which case they may be inherited independently of one another.
If the genes are on nonhomologous chromosomes, they may be recombined in various ways because of independent assortment.
For these reasons, the inheritance of polygenic characteristics is very complicated.
Such characteristics may have many possible phenotypes.
Skin color and adult height are examples of polygenic characteristics in humans.
Do you have any idea how many phenotypes each characteristic has?
Human adult height distribution
Human Adult Height.
Like many other polygenic traits, adult height has a bell-shaped distribution.
