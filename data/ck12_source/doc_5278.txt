Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inheritable disorder caused by a mutation in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).
The product of this gene is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat, digestive juices, and mucus.
Although most people without CF have two working copies of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis.
CF develops when individuals have a mutation in both copies of the gene, such that neither gene product works normally.
CF is one of the most common life shortening diseases.
Diagnosis is usually made in childhood.
In the United States, approximately 1 in 3,900 children is born with CF.
One in 22 people of European descent are carriers of a mutated CFTR gene.
CF mainly affects the lungs and digestive system, causing difficulty breathing due to thick mucus production, progressive disability, and for some individuals, premature death.
Individuals can be diagnosed prior to birth by genetic testing.
Because development of CF in the fetus requires each parent to pass on a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often initially performed on just one parent.
If that parent is found to be a carrier of a CFTR gene mutation, the other parent is then tested to calculate the risk that their children will have CF.
