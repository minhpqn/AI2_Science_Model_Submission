Define the coefficient of friction.
Calculate frictional forces.
Calculate net forces when friction is involved.
Matches on different tennis court surfaces feel like distinct experiences as a result of friction
Tennis is played on a variety of court surfaces: grass, clay, hardcourt, and even carpet.
Players know that matches on different surfaces are distinctly different games.
The ball bounces differently, and shoes slip on some surfaces but stick on others.
These differences are a result of friction.
Friction is the force that resists motion.
In most beginning physics classes, friction is ignored.
Concepts can be understood and calculations made assuming friction to be nonexistent.
Whenever physics intersects with the real world, however, friction must be taken into account.
Friction exists between two touching surfaces because even the smoothest looking surface is quite rough on a microscopic scale.
Sliding the two blocks over each other will result in frictional force between the two surfaces
Every surface has microscopic bumps, lumps, and imperfections, emphasized as in the image above.
If we try to slide the top block over the lower block, there will be numerous collisions as the bumps impact each other.
The forward motion causes the collisions with bumps which then exert a force in opposite way the block is moving.
The force of friction always opposes whatever motion is causing the friction.
The force of friction between these two blocks is related to two factors.
The first factor is the roughness of the surfaces that are interacting, which is called the coefficient of friction , \mu (Greek letter mu).
