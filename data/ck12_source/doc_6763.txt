A spring has a spring constant k equal to 200 N/m.
If it is stretched 0.4 m, what is its potential energy?
A 12 kg box is resting on a table 1.5 m off the ground.
It is then lifted up to 3.2 m off the ground.
What is its increase in potential energy?
(using g = 10 m/s 2 )
Describe kinetic energy and how to apply it.
Students will learn about kinetic energy, how and when to apply it and how to use kinetic energy
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \begin{cases}m & \text{mass~(in~kilograms,~kg)}\\\v & \text{speed~(in~meters~per~second,~}\text{m}/\text{s}\text{)}\end{cases}
Guidance The energy of motion is kinetic energy, KE.
Whenever an object is in motion it has kinetic energy.
The faster it is going, the more energy it has.
You are using a sling to throw a small stone.
If the sling is .5 m long and you are spinning it at 15 rad/s, how high would the rock go if you throw it straight up?
We'll start by setting the kinetic energy of rock to it's gravitational potential energy at it's maximum height and then solving for the rock's height.
We still don't know the rock's linear velocity, but we do know the sling's angular velocity and radius so we can put those into the equation instead.
h&=\frac{(\omega r)^2}{2g}\\\h&=\frac{(15\;\text{rad/s} * .5\;\text{m})^2}{2*9.8\;\text{m/s}^2}\\\h&=2.9\;\text{m}\\\
A bomb with 8 x 104 J of potential energy explodes.
Assume 20% of its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy of the metal pieces flying outward (shrapnel).
What is the total kinetic energy of the shrapnel?
