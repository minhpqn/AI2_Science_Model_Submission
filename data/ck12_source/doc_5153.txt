CDKs are present in all eukaryotes, and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved.
CDKs are small proteins with little more than the kinase domain.
A CDK binds to a cyclin regulatory protein, activating the protein; without binding to cyclin, the CDK has little kinase activity.
CDKs phosphorylate their substrates on serines and threonines, so they are serine-threonine kinases.
CDKs are also involved in regulating transcription, mRNA processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells.
The cell cycle has key checkpoints.
When the cell receives key signals or information via feedback regulation , the cell can begin the next phase of the cell cycle.
The cell can also receive signals that delay passage to the next phase of the cell cycle.
These signals allow the cell to complete the previous phase before moving forward.
Three key checkpoints are the cell growth (G 1 ) checkpoint, the G 2 checkpoint, and the mitosis checkpoint.
The DNA synthesis checkpoint is another checkpoint.
The cell growth (G 1 ) checkpoint allows the cell to proceed into the S phase of the cell cycle and continue on to divide, or delay division, or enter a resting stage.
The cell spends most of the cycle in the G 1 phase.
G 1 is where the cell carries out its main functions.
If the cell has performed its functions and has grown to significant size to be divided in half, key proteins will signal the cell to proceed to the S phase and stimulate DNA replication to begin.
If the cells are not to divide, such as some muscle and nerve cells, the cell will stop at this checkpoint and move into a resting phase, G 0 .
Some cells may stay in this resting period permanently, never dividing.
The second checkpoint is located at the end of G 2 phase.
Passing this checkpoint triggers the start of the mitosis.
If this checkpoint is passed, the cell initiates the many molecular processes that signal the beginning of mitosis.
