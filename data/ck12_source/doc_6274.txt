Heating curves show the phase changes that a substance undergoes as heat is continuously absorbed.
Heating curves show the phase changes that a substance undergoes as heat is continuously absorbed.
Heating curve of water.
The specific heat of a substance allows us to calculate the heat absorbed or released as the temperature of the substance changes.
It is possible to combine that type of problem with a change of state to solve a problem involving multiple steps.
The Figure above shows ice at -30°C being converted in a five-step process to gaseous water (steam) at 140°C.
It is now possible to calculate the heat absorbed during that entire process.
The process and the required calculation is summarized below.
Ice is heated from -30°C to 0°C.
The heat absorbed is calculated by using the specific heat of ice and the equation \Delta H = c_p \times m \times \Delta T .
Ice is melted at 0°C.
The heat absorbed is calculated by multiplying the moles of ice by the molar heat of fusion.
Water at 0°C is heated to 100°C.
The heat absorbed is calculated by using the specific heat of water and the equation \Delta H = c_p \times m \times \Delta T .
Water is vaporized to steam at 100°C.
The heat absorbed is calculated by multiplying the moles of water by the molar heat of vaporization.
Steam is heated from 100°C to 140°C.
The heat absorbed is calculated by using the specific heat of steam and the equation \Delta H = c_p \times m \times \Delta T .
