The Electrochemical Gradient - Advanced
Describe the electrochemical gradient.
Do you really have electricity flowing through your body?
Yes you do.
These electrical signals allow information to flow through the nervous system extremely rapidly.
And it all starts with the formation of an electrochemical gradient.
The Electrochemical Gradient
The active transport of ions across the cell membrane causes an electrical gradient to build up across this membrane.
The number of positively charged ions outside the cell is usually greater than the number of positively charged ions in the cytosol.
This results in a relatively negative charge on the inside of the membrane, and a positive charge on the outside.
This difference in charges causes a voltage to exist across the membrane.
Voltage is electrical potential energy that is caused by a separation of opposite charges, in this case across the membrane.
