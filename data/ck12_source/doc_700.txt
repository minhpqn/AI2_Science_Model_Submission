principal axis:  The principal axis for a mirror is line passing through the center of the surface of a spherical mirror and through the center of curvature of the mirror.
mirror equation:  \frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f} .
magnification equation:  m=-\frac{d_i}{d_o} .
Images in a Convex Mirror
Understand the difference between concave and covex mirrors.
Use ray diagrams to explain why convex mirrors form only virtual images.
Use the mirror and equation and the magnification equation with convex mirrors.
A car rearview mirror is a convex mirror
Convex mirrors provide a wide angle view and they provide an upright image.
Wide angle images have benefits in rearview mirrors, in-store customer monitors, and for viewing large areas like intersections and parking lots.
Images in a Convex Mirror
In  convex mirrors , the reflecting surface is on the outside of the sphere, making the center of curvature and the focal point on the opposite side of the mirror from the object.
Since the focal point is on the opposite side of the mirror from the object, the focal length is assigned a negative number.
Light rays that come to the mirror aimed at the focal point on the back side will be reflected parallel to the principal axis.
In the sketch, blue rays approach the mirror as if they would continue through the mirror toward the focal point (dotted blue lines).
They reflect along the purple lines parallel to the principal axis.
Light rays reflecting off a convex mirror
Similarly, light rays that approach the mirror parallel to the principal axis reflect as if they came from the focal point.
Example Problem:
A convex mirror has a radius of curvature of 40.0 cm.
