Importance of Reptiles
Reptiles play an important role in the life of humans.
In addition to playing an important role in many food chains, which keep the populations of small animals under control, reptiles serve as food, pets, and have played roles in art and culture for thousands of years.
Reptiles as Food
Reptiles are important as food sources for people:

Reptiles also make good pets.
In the Western world, some snakes, especially less aggressive species, like the ball python or corn snake, are kept as pets.
Turtles, particularly small land-dwelling and freshwater turtles, are also common pets.
