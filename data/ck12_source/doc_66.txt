There are three classes of fish:
Class Agnatha (the jawless fish), Class Chondrichthyes (the cartilaginous fish), and Class Osteichthyes (the bony fish).
All have the characteristics of fish in common, though there are differences unique to each class.
The humphead or Napoleon wrasse shows some of the general traits of fish, including scales, fins, and a streamlined body

How do Fish Breathe?
In order to absorb oxygen from the water, fish use gills ( Figure below ).
Gills take dissolved oxygen from water as the water flows over the surface of the gill.

How Do Fish Reproduce?
Fish reproduce sexually.
They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body.
In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body.
In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body.
The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs.
Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.
How Big Are Fish?
Fish range in size from the 65-foot, 75,000 pound whale shark ( Figure below ) to the stout infantfish, which is about 0.33 inches (8.4 mm), and the Paedocypris progenetica carp species of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, which is about 0.31 inches (7.9 mm) long, making it also the smallest known vertebrate animal.
The second-largest fish is the basking shark, which grows to about 40 feet and 8,000 pounds.
