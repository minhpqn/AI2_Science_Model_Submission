Endocrine signals are hormones, produced by endocrine organs.
These signals travel through the blood stream to reach all parts of the body.
The target cell then needs to be able to recognize the signal.
Chemical signals are received by the target cell on receptor proteins.
Most receptor proteins are found associated with the plasma membrane, but some are also found inside the cell.
Receptor proteins are very specific for only one particular signal molecule, much like a lock that recognizes only one key.
Therefore, a cell has lots of receptor proteins to recognize the large number of cell signal molecules.
There are three stages to sending and receiving a cell "message:" reception, transduction, and response.
Reception occurs when a ligand binds to its receptor.
Through transduction, the signal is then internalized.
The ligand does not have to be internalized for this process to occur.
The response may initiate a cascade of reactions including the activation/deactivation of enzymes and/or an alternation in gene transcription.
cell receptor :
Specialized proteins that take part in communication between the cell and the extracellular environment; often are integral membrane proteins.
cell signaling :
Part of a complex communication system that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions.
endocrine signaling :
Cell communication over long distances.
hormone :
A chemical messenger molecule.
