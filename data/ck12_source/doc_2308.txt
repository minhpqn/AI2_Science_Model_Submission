The revolution in science began when Copernicus made the first convincing arguments that the sun—not Earth—is the center of what we now call the solar system. (You can see both models of the solar system in the Figure below .) This was a drastic shift in thinking about Earth’s place in the cosmos.
Around 1600, the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the telescope, which had just been invented, and made many important discoveries in the field of astronomy.
Some of Galileo’s observations provided additional evidence for Copernicus’ sun-centered solar system.
Geocentric model and heliocentric model of the solar system
The model on the left shows what people believed about the solar system before Copernicus introduced the model on the right.
Q:
Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system were so influential that the scientific revolution is sometimes called the “Copernican revolution.” Why do you think Copernicus’ ideas led to a revolution in science?
A:
Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system are considered to be the starting point of modern astronomy.
They changed how all future scientists interpreted observations in astronomy.
They also led to a flurry of new scientific investigation.
Other contributions to science that occurred during the scientific revolution include:
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion
Newton’s law of universal gravitation
Newton’s three laws of motion
Einstein Rocks Science
Another major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein (the “rock star” scientist pictured in the opening image).
In 1916, Einstein published his general theory of relativity.
This theory relates matter and energy.
It also explains gravity as a property of space and time (rather than a property of matter as Newton thought).
