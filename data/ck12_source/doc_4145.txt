This is called vegetative reproduction .
One way this can occur is shown in Figure below .
Strawberry plants have horizontal stems called stolons that can form new plants.
Strawberry plants have horizontal stems called stolons that run over the ground surface.
If they take root, they form new plants.
All plants have a characteristic life cycle that includes alternation of generations.
Asexual reproduction with spores produces a haploid gametophyte generation.
Sexual reproduction with gametes and fertilization produces a diploid sporophyte generation.
