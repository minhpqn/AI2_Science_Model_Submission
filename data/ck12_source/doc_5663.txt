When an atomic bomb explodes, the nuclei of atoms undergo a process called fission, in which they split apart.
This releases the huge amount of energy that was holding together subatomic particles in the nucleus.
The nucleus is a small, dense region at the center of the atom.
It consists of positive protons and neutral neutrons, so it has an overall positive charge.
The nucleus is just a tiny part of the atom, but it contains virtually all of the atom’s mass.
The strong nuclear force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus and overcomes the electric force of repulsion between protons.
