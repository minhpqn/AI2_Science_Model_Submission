The matrix (space within the inner membrane).
Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from ancient prokaryotic cells.
Mitochondria are most often maternally inherited.
Identify the reason why mitochondria are called "power plants" of the cell.
What are the five compartments of a mitochondria?
If muscle cells become more active than they usually are, they will grow more mitochondria.
Explain why this happens.
What determines whether a child inherits a mitochondrial disease?
Endoplasmic Reticulum - Advanced
Outline the form and function of the endoplasmic reticulum.
Does a cell have its own ER?
Yes, but in this case, the ER is not just for emergencies.
True, there might be times when the cell responds to emergency conditions and the functions of the ER may be needed, but usually the cell's ER is involved in normal functions.
Proteins are also made on the outside of the ER, and this starts a whole process of protein transport, both around the inside of the cell and to the cell membrane and out.
The Endoplasmic Reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (plural, reticuli ) is a network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, flattened sheets, and round sacs.
These flattened, hollow folds and sacs are called cisternae .
The membrane of the ER is continuous with the outer layer of the nuclear envelope.
The ER has two major functions:
Transport :
