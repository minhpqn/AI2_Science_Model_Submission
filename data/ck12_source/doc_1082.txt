Greenland looks almost as big the United States.
Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased.
The United States is closer to its true dimensions.
Why is this true?
In a Mercator projection, all compass directions are straight lines.
This makes it a good type of map for navigation.
The top of the map is north, the bottom is south, the left side is west and the right side is east.
However, because it is a flat map of a curved surface, a straight line on the map is not the shortest distance between the two points it connects.
Instead of a cylinder, you could wrap the flat paper into a cone.
Conic map projections use a cone shape to better represent regions near the poles ( Figure below ).
Conic projections are best where the cone shape touches the globe.
This is along a line of latitude, usually the Equator.
A conic map projection wraps Earth with a cone shape rather than a cylinder

What if you want a different approach?
Let's say you don't want to wrap a flat piece of paper around a round object.
You could put a flat piece of paper right on the area that you want to map.
This type of map is called a gnomonic map projection ( Figure below ).
The paper only touches Earth at one point.
The sizes and shapes of countries near that point are good.
