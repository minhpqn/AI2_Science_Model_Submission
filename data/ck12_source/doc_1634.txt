When ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate, energy is released.
When ADP and inorganic phosphate are joined to form ATP, energy is stored.
During cellular respiration, about 36 to 38 ATP molecules are produced for every glucose molecule.
Drawing of the structure of ATP
The structural formula for adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
During cellular respiration, energy from the chemical bonds of the food you eat must be transferred to ATP.
Through the process of cellular respiration, the energy in food is converted into energy that can be used by the body's cells.
During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide and water, and the energy is transferred to ATP.
