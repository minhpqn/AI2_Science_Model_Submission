This scene is from Anza-Borrago California Desert Park.
However, deserts exist around the globe.
You might find a similar picture of a desert in Africa.
The desert is one type of biome.
What are Biomes?
Tropical rainforests and deserts are two familiar types of biomes.
A biome is an area with similar populations of organisms.
This can easily be seen with a community of plants and animals.
Remember that a community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another.
Different biomes, such as a forest ( Figure below ) or a desert, obviously have different communities of plants and animals.
How are the plants and animals different in the rainforest than those in the desert?
Why do you think they are so different?
The differences in the biomes are due to differences in the abiotic factors , especially climate.
Climate is the typical weather in an area over a long period of time.
The climate includes the amount of rainfall and the average temperature in the region.
Obviously, the climate in the desert is much different than the climate in the rainforest.
As a result, different types of plants and animals live in each biome.
This tropical rainforest has different plants than those found in a desert
Tropical rainforest landscape in Hawaii.
Notice how the plants are different from those in the desert.
