These capillaries are called peripheral capillaries .
Peripheral Gas Exchange
The cells of the body have a much lower concentration of oxygen than does the oxygenated blood in the peripheral capillaries.
Therefore, oxygen diffuses from the peripheral capillaries into body cells.
Carbon dioxide is produced by cells as a byproduct of cellular respiration, so it is more concentrated in the cells than in the blood of the peripheral capillaries.
As a result, carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction.
Back to the Lungs
The carbon dioxide from body cells travels in the blood from the peripheral capillaries to veins and then to the heart.
The heart pumps the blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses into the alveoli.
Then, the carbon dioxide passes out of the body through the other structures of the respiratory system, bringing the process of respiration full circle.
Gas Exchange and Homeostasis
Gas exchange is needed to provide cells with the oxygen they need for cellular respiration.
Cells cannot survive for long without oxygen.
Gas exchange is also needed to carry away carbon dioxide waste.
Some of the carbon dioxide in the blood dissolves to form carbonic acid, which keeps blood pH within a normal range.
Blood pH may become unbalanced if the rate of breathing is too fast or too slow.
When breathing is too fast, blood contains too little carbon dioxide and becomes too basic.
When breathing is too slow, blood contains too much carbon dioxide and becomes too acidic.
Clearly, to maintain proper blood pH, the rate of breathing must be regulated.
Respiration begins with ventilation, the process of moving air into and out of the lungs.
