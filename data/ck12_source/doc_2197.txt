It is more than three times as wide as Earth!
Clouds in the storm rotate counterclockwise.
They make one complete turn every six days or so.
The Great Red Spot has been on Jupiter for at least 300 years.
It may have been observed as early as 1664.
It is possible that this storm is a permanent feature on Jupiter.
No one knows for sure.
The Great Red Spot on Jupiter
The Great Red Spot has been on Jupiter since we've had telescopes powerful enough to see it.
Moons and Rings
Jupiter has lots of moons.
As of 2012, we have discovered over 66 natural satellites of Jupiter.
Four are big enough and bright enough to be seen from Earth using a pair of binoculars.
These four moons were first discovered by Galileo in 1610.
They are called the Galilean moons .
The figure below shows the four Galilean moons and their sizes relative to each other ( Figure below ).
These moons are named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
The Galilean moons are larger than even the biggest dwarf planets, Pluto and Eris.
Ganymede is the biggest moon in the solar system.
It is even larger than the planet Mercury!
