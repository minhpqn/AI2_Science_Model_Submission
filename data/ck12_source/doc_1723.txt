A locationâ€™s climate considers the same characteristics as its weather.
These are its air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and the type, quantity, and frequency of precipitation.
For climate, these things are averaged over time.
During the mid- to late-twentieth century, California received an enormous influx of new residents.

The climate of a region depends on its position relative to many things.
These factors are described in the next sections.
Climate is the long-term average of weather.
