Some orbitals, called S orbitals, are shaped like spheres, with the nucleus in the center.
An S orbital is pictured in Figure below .
Where the dots are denser, the chance of finding an electron is greater.
Also pictured in Figure below is a P orbital.
P orbitals are shaped like dumbbells, with the nucleus in the pinched part of the dumbbell.
You can see animated, three-dimensional models of orbitals at the following URL.

Models of S and P orbitals
Q:
How many electrons can there be in each type of orbital shown in the Figure above ?
A:
There can be a maximum of two electrons in any orbital, regardless of its shape.
Q:
Where is the nucleus in each orbital?
A:
The nucleus is at the center of each orbital.
It is in the middle of the sphere in the S orbital and in the pinched part of the P orbital.
Whatâ€™s Your Energy Level?
Electrons are located at fixed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels.
You can see the first three energy levels in the Figure below .
