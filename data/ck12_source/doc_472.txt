It’s like the pilot of a plane.
It tells other parts of the nervous system what to do.
The brain is also the most complex organ in the body.
Each of its 100 billion neurons has synapses connecting it with thousands of other neurons.
All those neurons use a lot of energy.
In fact, the adult brain uses almost a quarter of the total energy used by the body.
The developing brain of a baby uses an even greater amount of the body’s total energy.
The brain is the organ that lets us understand what we see, hear, or sense in other ways.
It also allows us to use language, learn, think, and remember.
The brain controls the organs in our body and our movements as well.
The brain consists of three main parts, the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem ( Figure below ).
The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain.
It sits on top of the brain stem.
The cerebrum controls functions that we are aware of, such as problem-solving and speech.
It also controls voluntary movements, like waving to a friend.
Whether you are doing your homework or jumping hurdles, you are using your cerebrum.
The cerebellum is the next largest part of the brain.
It lies under the cerebrum and behind the brain stem.
The cerebellum controls body position, coordination, and balance.
Whether you are riding a bicycle or writing with a pen, you are using your cerebellum.
