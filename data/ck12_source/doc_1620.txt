Explain the process of passive transport.
Distinguish between a channel protein and a carrier protein.
Summarize the functions of channel proteins and carrier proteins.
Can any molecule move freely through your cell membranes?
The cell regulates most molecules that pass through the cell membrane.
If a molecule is charged or very big, it won't make it through the cell membrane on its own.
However, small, non-charged molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water, can pass through the cell membrane freely.
Recall that the cell membrane is semipermeable.
It does not allow everything to pass through.
Some molecules can pass easily through your cell membranes, while others have more difficulty.
Sometimes molecules need the help of special transport proteins to move across the cell membrane.
Some molecules even need an input of energy to help get them across the cell membrane.
The movement of molecules across a membrane without the input of energy is known as passive transport .
When energy (ATP) is needed, the movement is known as active transport .
Active transport moves molecules against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration.
One example of passive transport is diffusion , when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount).
Molecules are said to naturally flow down their concentration gradient.
This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy.
In simple diffusion , molecules that are small and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane.
They simply flow through the cell membrane.
