Follow the process as outlined in Table below .
Number of Significant Figures
All digits are significant
8 rounds the 1 up to 2
2 is dropped
5 rounds the 7 up to 8
8 is replaced by a 0 and rounds the 0 upto 1
1 is replaced by a 0
Notice that the more rounding is done, the less reliable to figure is.
An approximate value may be sufficient for some purposes, but scientific work requires a much higher level of detail.
Rounding involves the adjustment of a value to account for the proper number of significant digits.
Rules exist for rounding of numbers.
