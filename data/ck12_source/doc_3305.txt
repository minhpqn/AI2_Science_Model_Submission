It occurs when electrons are transferred from one object to another.
A sudden flow of electrons from one charged object to another is called static discharge.
Examples of static discharge include lightning and the shock you sometimes feel when you touch another object.

Then answer the discussion questions.
Read the background essay if you need help with any of the questions.
What is static electricity?
How does static discharge occur?
Explain why a bolt of lightning is like the spark you might see when you touch a metal object and get a shock.
Describe electric current.
Explain why electric current occurs.
Emily’s dad is giving his car battery a “jump” because the battery “died” overnight.
He’s attaching cables to the terminals of the car battery.
Then he will connect the other ends of the cables to the terminals of a “live” battery.
The cables will carry electric current to the dead battery, providing the energy needed for the car to start.
Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges (electrons).
Current is measured as the amount of charge that flows past a given point in a certain amount of time.
The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), or amp.
Electric current may flow in just one direction (direct current), or it may keep reversing direction (alternating current).
