Scientists who use this method can reproduce another scientist's experiments.
Almost all versions of the scientific method include the following steps, although some scientists do use slight variations.
Identify a question you would like to answer based on the observation.
Find out what is already known about your observation (research).
Form a hypothesis.
Test the hypothesis.
Analyze your results and draw conclusions.
Communicate your results.
Steps of a scientific investigation
Steps of a Scientific Investigation.
A scientific investigation typically has these steps.
Imagine that you are a scientist.
While collecting water samples at a local pond, you notice a frog with five legs instead of four ( Figure below ).
As you start to look around, you discover that many of the frogs have extra limbs, extra eyes, or no eyes.
One frog even has limbs coming out of its mouth.
These are your observations , or things you notice about an environment using your five senses.
