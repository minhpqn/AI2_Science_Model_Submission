Of anaerobic respiration?
Tanya is on the high school track team and runs the 100-meter sprint.

Explain which type of respiration the muscle cells in each runnerâ€™s legs use.
Define cell division.
Explain binary fission.
Define mitosis and cytokinesis.
Contrast cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Where do cells come from?
No matter what the cell, all cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division.
The cell may be the simplest bacterium or a complex muscle, bone, or blood cell.
The cell may comprise the whole organism, or be just one cell of trillions.
You consist of a great many cells, but like all other organisms, you started life as a single cell.
How did you develop from a single cell into an organism with trillions of cells?
The answer is cell division.
After cells grow to their maximum size, they divide into two new cells.
These new cells are small at first, but they grow quickly and eventually divide and produce more new cells.
This process keeps repeating in a continuous cycle.
Cell division is the process in which one cell, called the parent cell , divides to form two new cells, referred to as daughter cells .
