Decide which forces act on the two body system and which are extraneous.
Explain what conditions would make it possible for the two-body system to move forward.
Discuss in class.
Free Body Diagrams
Draw a free-body diagram and apply it to the real world.
Students will learn how to draw a free-body diagram and apply it to the real world.
Guidance For every problem involving forces it is essential to draw a free body diagram (FBD) before proceeding to the problem solving stage.
The FBD allows one to visualize the situation and also to make sure all the forces are accounted.
In addition, a very solid understanding of the physics is gleaned and many questions can be answered solely from the FBD.

Draw free body diagrams (FBDs) for all of the following objects involved (in bold ) and label all the forces appropriately.
Make sure the lengths of the vectors in your FBDs are proportional to the strength of the force: smaller forces get shorter arrows!
