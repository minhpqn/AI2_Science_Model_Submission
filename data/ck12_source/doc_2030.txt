Describe the features of prokaryotes.
Why was the development of photosynthesis so important to the evolution of life?
What do we know about the first life forms?
Evolution of Eukaryotes to Multicellular Life
Describe key developments in the evolution of eukaryotes.
Outline the evolution of multicellular organisms.
If you could go back to the late Precambrian, would you recognize these as ancestors of modern life?
This is a depiction of Dickinsonia costata , a member of the Ediacara fauna.
No one knows quite how to categorize these organisms.
Some scientists think that they are the ancestors of modern life.
But most scientists believe that the Ediacara fauna died out and that other organisms were the ancestors of modern life.
If you could go back in time maybe you could figure it out.
But since that isn't possible, is there any way to really know?
Life Gets More Complex
Eukaryotes evolved about 2 billion years ago.
Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a cell nucleus.
They have more structures and are better organized.
Organelles within a eukaryote can perform certain functions.
Some supply energy; some break down wastes.
Eukaryotes were better able to live and so became the dominant life form.
