Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner.
However, soluble minerals may be present.
Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick.
Minerals and nutrients would have been washed out.
Climate is the most important factor determining soil type.
Given enough time, a climate will produce a particular type of soil.
The original rock type does not matter.
Two rocks of the same type will form a different soil type in each different climate.
This is true because most rocks on Earth are made of the same eight elements.
When the rock breaks down to become soil, the soil is the same.
The same climate factors that lead to high weathering also produce more soil.
More rain weathers minerals and rocks more.
Rain allows chemical reactions especially in the top layers of the soil.
More rain can dissolve more rock.
More rain can carry away more material.
As material is carried away, new surfaces are exposed.
This also increases the rate of weathering.
Higher temperatures increase the rate of chemical reactions.
This also increases soil formation.
In warmer regions, plants and bacteria grow faster.
