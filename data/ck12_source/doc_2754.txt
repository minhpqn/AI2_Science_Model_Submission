Glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) is one of the smallest sugar molecules.
Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process of photosynthesis.
Living things that cannot make glucose obtain it by consuming plants or these other organisms.
In the Figure below , you can see structural formulas for glucose and two other sugars, named fructose and sucrose.
Fructose is a sugar that is found in fruits.
It is an isomer of glucose.
Isomers are compounds that have the same atoms but different arrangements of atoms.
Do you see how the atoms are arranged differently in fructose than in glucose?
You’re probably most familiar with the sugar sucrose, because sucrose is table sugar.
It’s the sugar that you spoon onto your cereal or into your iced tea.
Structural formulas for glucose, fructose, and sucrose
Note :
Each unlettered point where lines intersect represents a carbon atom.
Q:
Compare the structure of sucrose with the structures of glucose and fructose.
How is sucrose related to the other two sugars?
A:
Sucrose consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose bonded together.
Starches are complex carbohydrates.
They are polymers of glucose.
