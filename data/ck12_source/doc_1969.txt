In time, the species may change a lot.
The descendants will be very different from their ancestors.
They may even become a new species.
This process is called biological evolution but is usually referred to just as evolution .
Organisms alive today evolved from earlier life forms.
We can learn about this from fossils.
For example, horse fossils from 60 million years ago are very different from modern horses.
Ancient horses were much smaller than they are today ( Figure below ).
The horsesâ€™ teeth and hooves have also changed.
The horses evolved because of changes in their environment.
Ancient horses were quite different from present-day horses
Ancient horses were quite different from present-day horses.
Although basic horse evolution appears to be linear, there were many more branches.
Horse evolution is very well understood.
Evolution happens because of natural selection .
Good traits become more common in a population.
Bad traits become less common.
The deer mouse, species Peromyscus maniculatus gives an example of evolution by natural selection.
In Nebraska, this mouse is typically brown.
But in places where glaciers dropped lighter sand over the darker soil, the mice are light.
