Diversification of the Mammals
Mammals have adapted to all sorts of different environments.
They were able to spread to even more environments than the reptiles.
Mammals are endothermic and have fur, hair, or blubber for warmth.
Mammals can walk, swim, or fly.
They can live in nearly all terrestrial environments.
Mammals initially filled the forests that covered many early Cenozoic lands.
When grasslands arose, mammals evolved to fill those niches too.
You can see pictures of many different mammals below ( Figure below ).
Pictures of mammals: a bat, whale, shrew, and elephant
(top left) This bat lives in a cave, emerging at night to find food. (top right) Although you might not guess it, these humpback whales are gigantic, ocean-dwelling mammals. (bottom left) This Eurasian pygmy shrew has found a home on the forest floor.
It is only a few inches long. (bottom right) These African elephants are native to central Africa.
