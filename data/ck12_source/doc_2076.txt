The most important of these may be the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.
Types of Renewable Resources
Renewable energy resources include solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power.
These resources are usually replaced at the same rate that we use them.
Scientists know that the Sun will continue to shine for billions of years.
So we can use the solar energy without it ever running out.
Water flows from high places to lower ones.
Wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.
We can use the flow of wind and water to generate power.
We can count on wind and water to continue to flow!
Burning wood ( Figure below ), is an example of biomass energy.
Changing grains into biofuels is biomass energy.
Biomass is renewable because we can plant new trees or crops to replace the ones we use.
Geothermal energy uses water that was heated by hot rocks.
There are always more hot rocks available to heat more water.
Wood is a renewable resource, but forest ecosystems need time to replenish
Wood is a renewable resource, but forest ecosystems need time to replenish.
Even renewable resources can be used unsustainably.
We can cut down too many trees without replanting.
We might need grains for food rather than biofuels.
