When electric current passes through a wire filament inside an incandescent bulb, the wire gets so hot that it glows.
Do you see the glowing filament inside the incandescent light bulb in the Figure below ?

Q:
What are some other sources of incandescent light?
A:
Flames also produce incandescent light.
For example, burning candles, oil lamps, and bonfires produce light in this way.
Some objects produce light without becoming very hot.
They generate light through chemical reactions or other processes.
Producing light without heat is called luminescence .
Luminescence, in turn, can occur in several different ways:
One type of luminescence is called fluorescence.
In this process, a substance absorbs shorter-wavelength ultraviolet light and then gives off light in the visible range of wavelengths.
Certain minerals produce light in this way, including gemstones such as amethyst, diamond, and emerald.

Another type of luminescence is called electroluminescence.
In this process, a substance gives off light when an electric current passes through it.
Gases such as neon, argon, and krypton produce light by this means.
The car dash lights in the Figure below are produced by electroluminescence.
