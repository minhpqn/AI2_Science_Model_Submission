Colored translucent and transparent materials appear the way they do because of the way they transmit light
The color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears.
For example, if only blue light strikes green leaves, the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected.
Q:
What color do you see if an object absorbs all of the light that strikes it?
A:
When all of the light is absorbed, none is reflected, so the object looks black.
But black isnâ€™t a color of light.
Black is the absence of light.
The Colors We See
The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light.
These three colors are called the primary colors of light.
All other colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors.
Look at the Venn diagram below .
Red and green light combine to form yellow light.
Red and blue light combine to form magenta light, and blue and green light combine to form cyan light.
Yellow, magenta, and cyan are called the secondary colors of light.
Look at the center of the diagram, where all three primary colors of light combine.
The result is white light.
