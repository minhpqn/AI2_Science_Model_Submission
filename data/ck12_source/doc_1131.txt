Explain how mass and distance influence the gravitational attraction between two objects.
Did you ever hear the old adage:
What goes up must come down?
Every moment of every day is a field trip to gravity.
Gravity is everywhere!
You have a gravitational attraction to your dog.
You have one to your pencil.
You even have one to your school principal!
These gravitational attractions are very small compared with the most important one you have.
This is your gravitational attraction to Earth.
It's what keeps you from floating off into space.
Gravity holds our planet together.
Gravity keeps Earth orbiting the Sun.
We wouldn't be here without gravity.
The Role of Gravity
All objects in the universe have an attraction to each other.
This attraction is known as gravity ( Figure below ).
The strength of the force of gravity depends on two things.
One is the mass of the objects.
The other is the distance between the objects.
