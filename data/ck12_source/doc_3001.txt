What will happen to this bungee jumper when he reaches the end of the bungee cord?
He wonâ€™t come to an abrupt stop.
If he did, he might be seriously hurt.
Instead, the cord will stretch while slowing his fall.
Q :
What will happen next?
A :
The cord will only stretch so far, and then it will snap back to its original shape, causing the jumper to bounce back up.
Bungee cords are useful for this purpose because they are elastic.
Elasticity and Elastic Force
Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed.
This property is called elasticity .
As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape.
It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction.
This force is called elastic force .
The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes.
As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape.
