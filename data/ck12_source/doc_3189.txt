For example, suppose that a wave is traveling at a speed of 2 meters per second and has a wavelength of 1 meter.
Then the frequency of the wave is:
Frequency = \mathrm{\frac{2m/s}{1m}}=2 \ \text{waves/s, or 2 Hz}
Q:
A wave is traveling at a speed of 2 m/s and has a frequency of 2 Hz.
What is its wavelength?
A:
Substitute these values into the equation for wavelength:
Wavelength = \mathrm{\frac{2m/s}{2 waves/s}}=1 \ \text{m}
The Medium Matters
The speed of most waves depends on the medium, or the matter through which the waves are traveling.
Generally, waves travel fastest through solids and slowest through gases.
Thatâ€™s because particles are closest together in solids and farthest apart in gases.
When particles are farther apart, it takes longer for the energy of the disturbance to pass from particle to particle through the medium.

Wave speed is the distance a wave travels in a given amount of time, such as the number of meters it travels per second.
Wave speed is related to wavelength and wave frequency by the equation:
Speed = Wavelength x Frequency.
This equation can be used to calculate wave speed when wavelength and frequency are known.
