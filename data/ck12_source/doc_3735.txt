Somatic mutations cannot be passed on to offspring.
Mutations also differ in the way that the genetic material is changed.
Mutations may change the structure of a chromosome or just change a single nucleotide.
Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure.
They occur when a section of a chromosome breaks off and rejoins incorrectly or does not rejoin at all.
Possible ways these mutations can occur are illustrated in Figure below .
Go to this link for a video about chromosomal alterations:
Chromosomal alterations: deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion, translocation
Chromosomal Alterations.
Chromosomal alterations are major changes in the genetic material.
Chromosomal alterations are very serious.
They often result in the death of the organism in which they occur.
If the organism survives, it may be affected in multiple ways.
An example of a human chromosomal alteration is the mutation that causes Down Syndrome.
It is a duplication mutation that leads to developmental delays and other abnormalities.
A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in DNA.
This type of mutation is usually less serious than a chromosomal alteration.
An example of a point mutation is a mutation that changes the codon UUU to the codon UCU.
Point mutations can be silent, missense, or nonsense mutations, as shown in Table below .
The effects of point mutations depend on how they change the genetic code.
