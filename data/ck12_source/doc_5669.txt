Number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number
Atoms of the element chromium (Cr) have an atomic number of 24 and a mass number of 52.
How many neutrons are in the nucleus of a chromium atom?
To determine this, you would subtract as shown:
52 - 24 = 28 neutrons in a chromium atom
The composition of any atom can be illustrated with a shorthand notation using the atomic number and the mass number.
Both are written before the chemical symbol, with the mass number written as a superscript and the atomic number written as a subscript.
The chromium atom discussed above would be written as:
Another way to refer to a specific atom is to write the mass number of the atom after the name, separated by a hyphen.
The above atom would be written as chromium-52.
The mass number is defined as the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom.
The number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number.
