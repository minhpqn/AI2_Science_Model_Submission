Chemistry of Life - Advanced
What do you see when you look at this picture?
Is it just a mass of tangled ribbons?
Look closely.

It represents the structure of a common chemical found inside living cells.
The chemical is a protein called hemoglobin.
It is the protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen around the body.
What are proteins?
What other chemicals are found in living things?
You will learn the answers to these questions as you read about the chemistry of life.
Chemical Substances - Advanced
Distinguish between atoms, elements, and ions.
Compare ionic bonds to covalent bonds.
Define organic compound.
Describe elements and compounds, and explain how mixtures differ from compounds.
Take some Cs, Hs, Ns, Os, Ps and Ss, combine them in many different combinations, and what do you get?
In just the right combinations, you get life.
Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
Some of the most basic of elements, but some of the most important.
