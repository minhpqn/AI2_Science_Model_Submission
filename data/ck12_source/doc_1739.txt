Animals and other living things depend on plants.
So each climate is associated with certain types of living things.
A major type of climate and its living things make up a biome .
As you read about the major climate types below, find them on the map above ( Figure above ).
Altitude and Latitude
Altitude mimics latitude in climate zones.
Climates and biomes typical of higher latitudes may be found at high altitudes.
Arizona is a state with a large elevation change.
In the late 1800s, C.
Hart Merriam noticed that the plant life changed with altitude in the same way it changes with latitude.
So on a trip from Phoenix up to the top of the mountain, you could see all of these life zones ( Figure below ):
Pictures of the Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Lower Boreal, and Upper Boreal life zones
(1) Lower Sonoran, sea level to 4,000 feet: cactus, desert scrub. (2) Upper Sonoran, 4,000 to 7,000: pinyon-juniper. (3) Transition, 7,000 to 8,000 feet:
Ponderosa Pine, some scrub; the snow-capped peak is Mt.
Humphreys. (4) Lower Boreal, 8,000 to 11,000:
Douglas fir, spruce;
Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine are found together in some forests. (5) Upper Boreal, above 11,000 alpine tundra; see Mt.
Humphreys above.
Climate conditions in a small area may be different from those of the surroundings.
The climate of the small area is called a microclimate .
