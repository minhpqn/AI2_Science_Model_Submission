Why do the Sun, Moon, and stars appear to rise in the east and set in the west?
What is the length of a day-night cycle?
Is it the same everywhere on Earth?
Explain the Coriolis effect.
Is this an example of the Coriolis effect?
Does Coriolis determine which direction water in a toilet will swirl?
Unfortunately, no.
Friction and the power of the flush have too big an influence.
But in the atmosphere and oceans, Coriolis affects flow direction.
The Coriolis effect is not a force, even though that's what it is sometimes called.
Coriolis does not force anything to happen!
Coriolis is an effect.
What does that mean?
The Coriolis effect describes how Earthâ€™s rotation steers winds and surface ocean currents.
Unlike land, air and water move freely (in the absence of obstacles).
The Coriolis effect causes the path of a freely moving object to appear to curve.
This is because Earth is rotating beneath the object.
So even though the object's path is straight, it appears to curve.
The curve appears to be to the right in the Northern Hemisphere.
It appears to be to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.
