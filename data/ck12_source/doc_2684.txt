Scientists use a standard method to represent a chemical reaction, called a chemical equation.
What Is a Chemical Equation?
A chemical equation is a shorthand way to sum up what occurs in a chemical reaction.
The general form of a chemical equation is:
Reactants → Products
The reactants in a chemical equation are the substances that begin the reaction, and the products are the substances that are produced in the reaction.
The reactants are always written on the left side of the equation and the products on the right.
The arrow pointing from left to right shows that the reactants change into the products during the reaction.
This happens when chemical bonds break in the reactants and new bonds form in the products.
As a result, the products are different chemical substances than the reactants that started the reaction.

Q:
What is the general equation for the reaction in which iron rusts?
A:
Iron combines with oxygen to produce rust, which is the compound named iron oxide.
This reaction could be represented by the general chemical equation below.
Note that when there is more than one reactant, they are separated by plus signs (+).
If more than one product were produced, plus signs would be used between them as well.
Iron + Oxygen → Iron Oxide
