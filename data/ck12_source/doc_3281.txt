Note that the image formed by a concave lens is on the same side of the lens as the object.
It is also smaller than the object and right-side up.
However, it isn’t a real image.
It is a virtual image.
Your brain “tricks” you into seeing an image there.
The light rays actually pass through the glass to the other side and spread out in all directions.

A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges.
You can see the shape of a convex lens in the Figure below .
A convex lens causes rays of light to converge, or meet, at a point called the focus (F).
A convex lens forms either a real or virtual image.
It depends on how close the object is to the lens relative to the focus.

Q:
An example of a convex lens is a hand lens.
Which of the three convex lens diagrams in the Figure above shows how a hand lens makes an image?
A:
You’ve probably looked through a hand lens before.
If you have, then you know that the image it produces is right-side up.
Therefore, the first diagram must show how a hand lens makes an image.
