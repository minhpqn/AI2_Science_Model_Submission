What type of star is it?
It’s called a neutron star.
That’s because it consists solely of neutrons.

What Is a Neutron?
A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom.
The other two particles are the proton and electron.
Atoms of all elements—except for most atoms of hydrogen—have neutrons in their nucleus.
The nucleus is the small, dense region at the center of an atom where protons are also found.
Atoms generally have about the same number of neutrons as protons.
For example, all carbon atoms have six protons and most also have six neutrons.
A model of a carbon atom is shown in the Figure below .

Properties of Neutrons
Unlike protons and electrons, which are electrically charged, neutrons have no charge.
In other words, they are electrically neutral.
That’s why the neutrons in the diagram above are labeled n 0 .
