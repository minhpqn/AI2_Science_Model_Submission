This is easily determined when the oil drop is stationary; namely, when the downward gravitational force exactly equals the upward electrical force on the drop.
Example Problem:  An oil drop weighs 1.9 \times 10^{-14} \ N .  It is suspended in an electric field whose intensity is 4.0 \times 10^4 \ N/C .  Since the oil drop is suspended, the gravitational force, 1.9 \times 10^{-4} \ N , is equal to the electrical force, F_E = Eq .
What is the charge on the oil drop?
Solution: q=\frac{weight}{E}=\frac{1.9 \times 10^{-14} \ N}{4.0 \times 10^4 \ N/C}=4.8 \times 10^{-19} \ C
The charge on this particular oil drop was 4.8 \times 10^{-19} \ C .
In doing his experiment, however, Millikan faced a problem.
When the oil is sprayed through the atomizer, some oil drops are negatively charged, but we donâ€™t know how many extra electrons the drops acquire.
The charge on this oil drop could be the result of having one extra electron, or having five extra electrons.
In order to determine the charge on one electron, the oil drop experiment was carried out many times, and the charges on many oil drops was determined.
The smallest charge was found to be 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \ C , and all the other charges on oil drops were found to be whole number multiples of 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \ C .  In the example problem above, we would conclude that the oil drop held three extra electrons.
Using a uniform electric field between two charged parallel plates and oil drops, Millikan determined the charge on a single electron.
The friction of the oil passing through the narrow opening puts charges on many of the oil drops.
When an oil drop is stopped by adjusting the charge on the plates, its weight, mg , downward equals the electrical force, E_q , upward.
