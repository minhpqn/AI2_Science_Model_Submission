What must be held constant for the combined gas law to be true?
What happens to the combined gas law if temperature, pressure, or volume are held constant?
Combined gas law problems with solutions:
A sample of gas has a volume of 800. mL at -23.0°C and 300.
Torr.  What would the volume of the gas be at 227.0°C and 600.
Torr?
500.0 L of gas are prepared at 0.921 atm pressure and 200.0°C.
The gas is placed into a tank under high pressure.  When the tank cools to 20.0°C, the pressure is 30.0 atm.  What is the volume of the gas under these conditions?
What is the volume of gas at 2.00 atm and 200.0 K if its original volume was 300.
L at 0.250 atm and 400.0 K?
gas laws:
A series of laws in physics that predict the behavior of an ideal gas by describing the relations between the temperature, volume, and pressure.
The laws include Boyle's law, Charles' law, and Gay-Lussac’s law, and are combined in the combined gas law.
Universal Gas Law
