Graphite is one of several forms of carbon.
How can a single element exist in different forms?
A:
Carbon can exist in different forms because atoms of carbon can combine in different ways.
What Are the Forms of Carbon?
Graphite is one of three forms of crystalline, or crystal-forming, carbon.
Carbon also exists in an amorphous, or “shapeless,” form in substances such as coal and charcoal.
Different forms of the same element are called allotropes.
Besides graphite, the other allotropes of crystalline carbon are diamond and fullerenes.
All three forms exist as crystals rather than molecules.
In a crystal, many atoms are bonded together in a repeating pattern that may contains thousands of atoms.
The arrangement of atoms in the crystal differs for each form of carbon and explains why the different forms have different properties.

Q:
How do you think the properties of diamond might differ from the properties of graphite?
A:
Diamond is clear whereas graphite is black.
Diamond is also very hard, so it doesn’t break easily.
Graphite, in contrast, is soft and breaks very easily.
