What is ATP?
Give an overview of aerobic cellular respiration.
Why do nearly all organisms die without a constant supply of oxygen?
Describe the difference between respiration and cellular respiration.
What is the role of oxygen in cellular respiration?
Which is most efficient, aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration?
Cellular Respiration Overview - Advanced
Trace the flow of energy from food molecules through ATP to its use in cellular work.
Compare cellular respiration to burning.
Analyze the chemical equation for cellular respiration.
Briefly describe the role of mitochondria in producing ATP.
Compare cellular respiration to photosynthesis.
Because we're hungry.
Not necessarily.
Biologically speaking, we eat to get energy.
The food we eat is broken down, the glucose extracted, and that energy is converted into ATP.
And this happens most efficiently in the presence of oxygen.
An Overview of Cellular Respiration
Another way to think about the role of oxygen in your body - and a good starting point for understanding the whole process of cellular respiration - is to recall (or imagine) the last time you sat by a campfire (see Figure below ) and noticed that it was "dying." Often people will blow on a campfire to keep it from "dying out." How does blowing help?
