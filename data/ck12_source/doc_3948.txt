These fuels formed from the remains of plants over hundreds of millions of years.
We are using them up far faster than they could ever be replaced.
At current rates of use, petroleum will be used up in just a few decades and coal in less than 300 years.
Nuclear power is also considered to be a nonrenewable resource because it uses up uranium, which will sooner or later run out.
It also produces harmful wastes that are difficult to dispose of safely.
Fueling a car using gas
Gasoline is made from crude oil.
The crude oil pumped out of the ground is a black liquid called petroleum, which is a nonrenewable resource.
Lumps of coal
Coal is another nonrenewable resource.

Scientists at the Massachusetts of Technology are turning trash into coal, which can readily be used to heat homes and cook food in developing countries.
This coal burns cleaner than that from fossil fuels.
It also save a tremendous amount of energy.
