As your negatively charged hand gets very close to the positively charged side of the metal, the air between your hand and the knocker also becomes electrically charged.
This allows electrons to suddenly flow from your hand to the knocker.
The sudden flow of electrons is static discharge .
The discharge of electrons is the spark you see and the shock you feel.
Watch the animation “John Travoltage” at the following URL to see an example of static electricity and static discharge.
How Lightning Occurs
Another example of static discharge, but on a much larger scale, is lightning.
You can see how it occurs in the following diagram ( Figure below ) and animation as you read about it below.
Lightning is the result of the discharge of static electricity
During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles.
The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds, and the positive charges are concentrated at the top.
The negative charges repel electrons on the ground beneath them, so the ground below the clouds becomes positively charged.
At first, the atmosphere prevents electrons from flowing away from areas of negative charge and toward areas of positive charge.
As more charges build up, however, the air between the oppositely charged areas also becomes charged.
When this happens, static electricity is discharged as bolts of lightning.
At the URL below, you can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike.
Be sure to wait for the real-time lightning strike at the end of the video.
You’ll be amazed when you realize how much has occurred during that split-second discharge of static electricity.

Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on objects.
