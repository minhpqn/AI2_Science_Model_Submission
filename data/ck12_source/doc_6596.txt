The linkage structure in cellulose is different than that of starch, and cellulose is indigestible except by a few microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of cattle and termites.
The figure below shows a triple strand of cellulose.
There is no branching and the fibers adopt a very stiff rod-like structure with numerous hydrogen bonds between the fibers adding to its strength.
Cellulose is the main component of paper, cardboard, and textiles made from cotton, linen, and other plant fibers.
Ball and stick structure of cellulose
Cellulose is composed of very long strands of glucose monomers that are hydrogen bonded to one another.
Cellulose is largely indigestible and comprises the cell walls of plants.
Polysaccharide is defined.
Common examples of polysaccharides are listed.
