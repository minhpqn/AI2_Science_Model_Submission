As light passes through the lens, it forms a reduced real image.
The image focuses on film (or a sensor) at the back of the camera.
The lens may be moved back and forth to bring the image into focus.
The shutter controls the amount of light that actually strikes the film (or sensor).
It stays open longer in dim light to let more light in.

Schematic of a camera
Did you ever see a cat chase after a laser light, like the one in Figure below ?
A laser is a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just one wavelength and color.
Waves of laser light are synchronized so the crests and troughs of the waves line up.
The diagram in Figure below shows why a beam of laser light is so focused compared with ordinary light from a flashlight.
Lasers are created by tight beams of coherent light
The following Figure below provides a closer look at the tube where laser light is created.
Electrons in a material such as a ruby crystal are stimulated to radiate photons of light of one wavelength.
At each end of the tube is a concave mirror.
The photons of light reflect back and forth in the tube off these mirrors.
This focuses the light.
The mirror at one end of the tube is partly transparent.
A constant stream of photons passes through the transparent part, forming the laser beam.
