This orange sponge is covered with pores.
Can you predict the function of the pores?
Structure and Function of Sponges
Sponges come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
For example, they may be shaped like tubes, fans, cones, or just blobs.
They range in diameter from about a centimeter (0.4 inches) to over a meter (3.3 feet).
Many species live in colonies that may be quite large.
Adult sponges are sessile.
This means they are unable to move from place to place.
Root-like projections anchor them to solid surfaces such as rocks and reefs.
Sponges have an internal skeleton that gives them support and protection.
An internal skeleton is called an endoskeleton.
A sponge endoskeleton consists of short, sharp rods called spicules (see Figure below ).
Spicules are made of silica, calcium carbonate, or spongin , a tough protein.
They grow from specialized cells in the body of the sponge.
Sponge Anatomy.
A sponge lacks tissues and organs, but it has several types of specialized cells.
Sponges are filter feeders.
They pump water into their body through their pores.
The water flows through a large central cavity called the spongocoel (see Figure above ).
