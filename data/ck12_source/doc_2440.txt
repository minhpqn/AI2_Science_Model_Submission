Can you think of examples of matter that usually exists in just one of these three states?
A:
Just look around you and you will see many examples of matter that usually exists in the solid state.
They include soil, rock, wood, metal, glass, and plastic.
Examples of matter that usually exist in the liquid state include cooking oil, gasoline, and mercury, which is the only metal that commonly exists as a liquid.
Examples of matter that usually exists in the gaseous state include oxygen and nitrogen, which are the chief gases in Earth’s atmosphere.
Phases Are Physical
A given kind of matter has the same chemical makeup and the same chemical properties regardless of its state.
That’s because state of matter is a physical property.
As a result, when matter changes state, it doesn’t become a different kind of substance.
For example, water is still water whether it exists as ice, liquid water, or water vapor.
Properties of Solids, Liquids, and Gases
The most common states of matter on Earth are solids, liquids, and gases.
How do these states of matter differ?
Their properties are contrasted in the Figure below .
