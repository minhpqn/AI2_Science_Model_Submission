Can you explain how?
Flowering vascular plants also have diverse leaves.
However, the leaves of all flowering plants have two basic parts in common: the blade and petiole.
The blade of the leaf is the relatively wide, flat part of the leaf that gathers sunlight and undergoes photosynthesis.
The petiole is the part that attaches the leaf to a stem of the plant.
This occurs at a node.
Flowering plant leaves vary in how the leaves are arranged on the stem and how the blade is divided.
This is illustrated in Figure below .
Generally, the form and arrangement of leaves maximizes light exposure while conserving water, reducing wind resistance, or benefiting the plant in some other way in its particular habitat.
Leaves arranged in whorls encircle upright stems at intervals.
They collect sunlight from all directions.
Leaves arranged in basal rosettes take advantage of warm temperatures near the ground.
Leaves arranged in alternate or opposing pairs collect light from above.
They are typically found on plants with a single, upright stem.
The blades of simple leaves are not divided.
This provides the maximum surface area for collecting sunlight.
The blades of compound leaves are divided into many smaller leaflets.
This reduces wind resistance and water loss.
Leaf variation in flowering plants
Leaf variation in flowering plants may include variations in the arrangement of leaves and the divisions of the blade.
