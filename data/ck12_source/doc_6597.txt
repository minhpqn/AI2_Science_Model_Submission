List the twenty common amino acids.
Nutritional supplement pills
Will supplements really help?
Athletics are very competitive these days at all levels, from school sports to the pros.
Everybody is looking for that edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically fit.
One approach taken by many athletes is the use of amino acid supplements.
The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for muscles.
However, the only real benefit comes to the people who make and sell the pills.
Studies have not showed any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves.
You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet.
An amino acid is a compound that contains both an amino group (−NH 2 ) and a carboxyl group (−COOH) in the same molecule.
While any number of amino acids can possibly be imagined, biochemists generally reserve the term for a group of 20 amino acids which are formed and used by living organisms.
The Figure below shows the general structure of an amino acid.
Basic structure of an amino acid
An amino acid is an organic molecule that contains an amino group, a carboxyl group and a side chain (R), all bonded to a central carbon atom.
The amino and carboxyl groups of an amino acid are both covalently bonded to a central carbon atom.
That carbon atom is also bonded to a hydrogen atom and an R group.
It is this R group which varies from one amino acid to another and is called the amino acid side chain.
The nature of the side chains accounts for the variability in physical and chemical properties of the different amino acids.
Some side chains consist of nonpolar aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons.
