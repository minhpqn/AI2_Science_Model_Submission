What causes the nucleus of uranium-235 atom to fission?
A:
Another particle collides with it.
How Nuclear Fission Occurs
The Figure below shows how nuclear fission of uranium-235 occurs.
It begins when a uranium nucleus gains a neutron.
This can happen naturally when a free neutron strikes it, or it can occur deliberately when a neutron is crashed into it in a nuclear power plant.
In either case, the nucleus of uranium-235 becomes extremely unstable with the extra neutron.
As a result, it splits into two smaller nuclei, krypton-92 and barium-141.
The reaction also releases three neutrons and a great deal of energy.
It can be represented by this nuclear equation:
\mathrm{^{235}_{92} U} + 1 neutron â†’ \mathrm{^{92}_{36} Kr} + \mathrm{^{141}_{56} Ba} + 3 neutrons + energy
Note that the subscripts of the element symbols represent numbers of protons and the superscripts represent numbers of protons plus neutrons.

Nuclear Chain Reaction
The neutrons released when uranium-235 fissions may crash into other uranium nuclei and cause them to fission as well.
This can start a nuclear chain reaction.
You can see how this happens in the Figure below .
In a chain reaction, one fission reaction leads to others, which lead to others, and so on.
