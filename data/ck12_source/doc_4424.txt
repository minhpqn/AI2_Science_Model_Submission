Marsupials.
Marsupials include the kangaroo, koala, and opossum.
The Marsupial Embryo
The marsupial embryo is nourished inside the uterus with food from a yolk sac instead of through a placenta.
The yolk sac stores enough food for the short period of time the embryo remains in the uterus.
After the embryo is born, it moves into the mother’s pouch, where it clings to a nipple.
It remains inside the pouch for several months while it continues to grow and develop.
Even after the offspring is big enough to leave the pouch, it may often return to the pouch for warmth and nourishment.
Eventually, the offspring is mature enough to remain outside the pouch on its own.
Pros and Cons of Marsupial Development
In marsupials, the short period of development within the mother’s uterus reduces the risk of her immune system attacking the embryo.
In addition, the marsupial mother doesn’t have to eat extra food or carry a large fetus inside her.
The risks of giving birth to a large fetus are also avoided.
Another pro is that the mother can expel the embryo from her pouch if she is pursued by a predator or if food is scarce.
On the other hand, a newborn marsupial is tiny and fragile.
Therefore, it may be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal.

The Opossum
Most people think of opossums as scary creatures.
Is this because they look kind of funny, walk kind of funny, have beady eyes and sharp teeth, and can emit a very foul odor?
