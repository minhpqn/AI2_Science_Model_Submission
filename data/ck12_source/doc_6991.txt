Describe how light behaves when passing through converging and diverging lenses.
Use ray tracing diagrams and calculate image distances and magnification using the lens' maker's equation.
Students will learn how light behaves when passing through converging and diverging lenses.
Students will also learn how to do ray tracing diagrams and calculate image distances and magnification using the lens' maker's equation.
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} +\frac{1}{d_i} \;  ;
The len's maker's equation
Where f is the focal length of the lens,  d_o  is the distance of the object from the lens and  d_i  is the distance the image is formed from the lens.
M = \frac{-d_i}{d_0}
The size of an objectâ€™s image is larger (or smaller) than the object itself by its magnification, M .
The level of magnification is proportional to the ratio of d_i and d_o .
An image that is double the size of the object would have magnification M = 2 .
