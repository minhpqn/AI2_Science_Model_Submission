Step 2:
Calculate
1 \ \text{d} \times \frac{24 \ \text{h}}{1 \ \text{d}} \times \frac{60 \ \text{min}}{1 \ \text{h}} \times \frac{60 \ \text{s}}{1 \ \text{min}}=86, 400 \ \text{s}
Applying the first conversion factor, the “d” unit cancels and 1 × 24 = 24.
Applying the second conversion factor, the “h” unit cancels and 24 × 60 = 1440.
Applying the third conversion factor, the “min” unit cancels and 1440 × 60 = 86,400.
The unit that remains is “s” for seconds.
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Seconds is a much smaller unit of time than a day, so it makes sense that there are a very large number of seconds in one day.
A conversion factor is a ratio of equivalent measurements.
Dimensional analysis is a technique that uses the units (dimensions) of the measurement in order to correctly solve problems.
