Cancer (Advanced) concept, cancer is described as developing due to unregulated cell division.
That is, cancer is a disease characterized by a population of cells that grow and divide without respect to normal limits.
These cancerous cells invade and destroy adjacent tissues, and they may spread throughout the body.
The process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells is known as carcinogenesis .
This process is also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis.
Oncogenes are mutated genes involved in the development of cancer.
Nearly all cancers are caused by mutations in the DNA of the abnormal cells.
These mutations may be due to the effects of carcinogens , cancer causing agents such as tobacco smoke, radiation, chemicals, or infectious agents.
These carcinogens may act as an environmental “trigger,” stimulating the onset of cancer in certain individuals and not others.
Do all people who smoke get cancer?
No.
Can secondhand smoke increase a nonsmoking person's chance of developing lung cancer?
Yes.
It also increases a nonsmoking person's chance of developing heart disease.
Complex interactions between carcinogens and an individual’s genome may explain why only some people develop cancer after exposure to an environmental trigger and others do not.
Do all cancers need an environmental trigger to develop?
No.
Cancer causing mutations may also result from errors incorporated into the DNA during replication, or they may be inherited.
Inherited mutations are present in all cells of the organism.
