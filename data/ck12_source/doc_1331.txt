An aerial view shows the damage to Sendai, Japan caused by the earthquake and tsunami.
Worst of all was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the northeastern coast.
Eleven reactors were automatically shut down.
Power and backup power were lost at the Fukushima plant.
This lead to equipment failures, meltdowns, and the release of radioactive materials.
Cleanup of the disabled plants will go on for many years.
Tsunami Warning Systems
Most of the Indian Ocean tragedy could have been avoided if a warning system had been in place ( Figure below ).
As of June 2006, the Indian Ocean now has a warning system.
Communities around the Pacific have had a tsunami warning system since 1948.

This sign is part of the tsunami warning system used in communities around the Pacific Ocean since 1948.
As in Japan, warning systems arenâ€™t always helpful.
People in communities very close to the earthquake do not have enough time to move out of the area.
Farther away from the quake, evacuation of low-lying areas saves lives.
Tsunamis have relatively low amplitude and long wavelengths.
They are not noticeable until they move up a shore.
Tsunami warning systems are now found in most locations where tsunamis are possible.
The Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 came from a massive earthquake.
The waves traveled across the Indian Ocean, causing death and destruction in 12 nations.
