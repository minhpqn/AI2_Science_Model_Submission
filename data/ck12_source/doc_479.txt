The Nature of Human Vision
Think about all the ways that students use their sense of sight during a typical school day.
As soon as they open their eyes in the morning, they might look at the clock to see what time it is.
Then, they might look out the window to see what the weather is like.
They probably look in a mirror to comb their hair.
