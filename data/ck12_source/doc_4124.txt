How was it formed?
How did life begin on Earth?
These questions have fascinated scientists for centuries.
During the 1800s, geologists, paleontologists, and naturalists found several forms of physical evidence that confirmed that Earth is very old.
The evidence includes:
Fossils of ancient sea life on dry land far from oceans.
This supported the idea that the Earth changed over time and that some dry land today was once covered by oceans.
The many layers of rock.
When people realized that rock layers represent the order in which rocks and fossils appeared, they were able to trace the history of Earth and life on Earth.
Indications that volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion that happened long ago shaped much of the Earthâ€™s surface.
This supported the idea of an older Earth.
The Earth is at least as old as its oldest rocks.
The oldest rock minerals found on Earth so far are crystals that are at least 4.404 billion years old.
These tiny crystals were found in Australia.
Likewise, Earth cannot be older than the solar system.
The oldest possible age of Earth is 4.57 billion years old, the age of the solar system.
Therefore, the age of Earth is between 4.4 and 4.57 billion years.
Geologic Time Scale
Geologists and other Earth scientists use geologic time scales to describe when events happened in the history of Earth.
The time scales can be used to show when both geologic events and events affecting plant and animal life occurred.
