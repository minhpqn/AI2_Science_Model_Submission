An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material.
A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it.
This gives the coil north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field.
The magnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains.
You can see this in the Figure below .

Strength of an Electromagnet
The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar makes an electromagnet very strong.
In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made.
An electromagnet is stronger if there are more turns in the coil of wire or there is more current flowing through it.
A bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also increases an electromagnetâ€™s strength.
At the following URL, you can see an animation demonstrating how these factors affect the strength of an electromagnet.
Easy On and Off
Besides their strength, another pro of electromagnets is the ability to control them by controlling the electric current.
Turning the current on or off turns the magnetic field on or off.
The amount of current flowing through the coil can also be changed to control the strength of the electromagnet.
