Describe how fossils help us understand the past.
Would this be evidence of evolution?
Fossils, like this dinosaur fossil, provide evidence of species that lived in the past and have since gone extinct.
In other words, these fossils are evidence of evolution.
In his book On the Origin of Species , Darwin included evidence to show that evolution had taken place.
He also made logical arguments to support his theory that evolution occurs by natural selection.
Since Darwinâ€™s time, much more evidence has been gathered.
The evidence includes a huge number of fossils.
It also includes more detailed knowledge of living things, right down to their DNA.
Fossils are a window into the past.
They provide clear evidence that evolution has occurred.
Scientists who find and study fossils are called paleontologists .
How do they use fossils to understand the past?
Consider the example of the horse, shown in the Figure below .
The fossil record shows how the horse evolved.
Evolution of the horse
Evolution of the horse.
Fossil evidence, depicted by the skeletal fragments, demonstrates evolutionary milestones in this process.
Notice the 57 million year evolution of the horse leg bones and teeth.
Especially obvious is the transformation of the leg bones from having four distinct digits to that of today's horse.
