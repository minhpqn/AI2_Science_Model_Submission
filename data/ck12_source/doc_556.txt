It can be described as a specific response to a specific pathogen, meaning it uses methods to target just one pathogen at a time.
These methods involve B and T cells.
B Cell Response
B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph.
Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies.
An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen , a protein that is recognized as foreign.
Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms.
Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure below ).
They fit together like a lock and key.
Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them.
Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis.
As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process.
At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens.
This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body.
This diagram illustrates how an antibody binds to an antigen
This diagram shows how an antibody binds with an antigen.
The antibody was produced by a B cell.
It binds with just one type of antigen.
Antibodies produced by different B cells bind with other types of antigens.
The antigen-binding sites can vary, such that they are specific for just one antigen.
