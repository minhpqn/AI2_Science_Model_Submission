Your class is building boats out of aluminum foil.
One group fashions a boat with a square 10 \;\mathrm{cm} by 10\;\mathrm{cm} bottom and sides 1 \;\mathrm{cm} high.
They begin to put 2.5 \;\mathrm{g} coins in the boat, adding them until it sinks.
Assume they put the coins in evenly so the boat doesn’t tip.
How many coins can they put in? (You may ignore the mass of the aluminum boat … assume it is zero.)
You are riding a hot air balloon.
The balloon is a sphere of radius 3.0 \;\mathrm{m} and it is filled with hot air.
The density of hot air depends on its temperature: assume that the density of the hot air is 0.925 \;\mathrm{kg/m}^3 , compared to the usual 1.29 \;\mathrm{kg/m}^3 for air at room temperature.
The balloon and its payload (including you) have a combined mass of 100 \;\mathrm{kg} .
Draw a free body diagram for the cube.
Is the balloon accelerating upward or downward?
What is the magnitude of the acceleration?
Why do hot air ballooners prefer to lift off in the morning?
What would limit the maximum height attainable by a hot air balloon?
You are doing an experiment in which you are slowly lowering a tall, empty cup into a beaker of water.
The cup is held by a string attached to a spring scale that measures tension.
You collect data on tension as a function of depth.
The mass of the cup is 520 \;\mathrm{g} , and it is long enough that it never fills with water during the experiment.
The data Table ( below was collected; use it to complete the following problems:
Complete the chart ( Table below ) by calculating the buoyant force acting on the cup at each depth.
