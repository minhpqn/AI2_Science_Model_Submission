Climate Watch:
California at the Tipping Point
The world's climate is changing and California is now being affected in both dramatic and subtle ways.
In 2008, scientists determined that California’s temperatures increased by more than 2.1°F during the last century.
What’s more, the data showed that human activity has played a significant role in that climate change. "What's just 2 degrees?" you may wonder.
But, as the science shows, just 2 degrees is extremely significant.
What does all this temperature change mean?
For starters, declining mountain snowpack and prolonged drought conditions could pose a threat to limited water supplies.
Heat waves are projected to be longer, bringing increased danger from wildfires and heat-related deaths.
Rising sea levels due to temperature shifts jeopardize life in coastal areas, both for human communities and the plants and animals that rely on intertidal and rich wetland ecosystems.
Also, more precipitation is expected to fall as rain rather than snow, thereby increasing the risk of floods.
And, as heat increases the formation of smog, poor air quality could get even worse.
Climate change may also profoundly affect the economy in California and elsewhere.
Shorter ski seasons and damage to the marine ecosystem mean a reduction in tourism.
Water shortages mean issues with the commercial and recreational fishing industry, and higher temperatures will affect crop growth and quality, weakening the agricultural industry, to name just a few of the economic issues associated with climate change.
