Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument is very likely to be true, but you cannot be fully sure it is true because you are making a prediction about a fact that has yet to be proven.
A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the philosopher David Hume:
Reason:
The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.
Conclusion:
The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.
Inductive reasoning involves reaching conclusions about unobserved things on the basis of what has already been observed.
Induction is used regularly in fields such as archaeology, where inferences about the past from present are made.
Inductions could also be made across outer space, as in astronomy, where conclusions about the whole universe are drawn from the limited number of observations we are able to make.
deduction :
Involves determining a single fact from a general statement.
induction :
Involves determining a general statement that is very likely to be true, from several facts; the relief of repression for a gene or set of genes under negative control.
Any useful hypothesis will allow predictions based on reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories: deduction and induction.
Most reasoning in science is formed through induction.
