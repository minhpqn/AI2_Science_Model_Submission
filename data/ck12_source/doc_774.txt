We then simplify R_1 and R_{23} which are series resistors.
R_T=R_1+R_{23}=110 \ \Omega + 99 \ \Omega = 209 \ \Omega
We can then find the total current, I_T=\frac{V_T}{R_T}=\frac{24 \ V}{209 \ \Omega}=0.11 \ A .
All the current must pass through R_1 , so I_1=0.11 \ A .
The voltage drop through R_1 is (110 \ \Omega) (0.11 \ A)=12.6 \text{ volts} .
Therefore, the voltage drop through R_2 and R_3 is 11.4 volts.
I_2=\frac{V_2}{R_2}=\frac{11.4 \ V}{180 \ \Omega}=0.063 \ A and I_3=\frac{V_3}{R_3}=\frac{11.4 \ V}{220 \ \Omega}=0.052 \ A
