By understanding the way temperature changes with altitude, we can learn a lot about how the atmosphere works.
Warm Air Rises
This is really important:
Warm air rises.
Why does warm air rise ( Figure below )?
Gas molecules are able to move freely.
Gas molecules move more at higher temperatures.
They can take up as much space as is available.
When gas molecules are cool, they are sluggish.
They take up less space.
With the same number of molecules in less space, both air density and air pressure are higher.
When gas molecules are warm, they move vigorously.
They take up more space.
Air density and air pressure are lower.
Warmer, lighter air is more buoyant than the cooler air above it.
So the warm air rises.
The cooler air is denser than the air beneath it.
So it sinks down.
This is convection: warm air rises, and cool air sinks.
Warm fluids can undergo convection as well.
