What is a covalent radius?
What is an ionic radius?
Define “atomic radius.”
What are the units for measurement of atomic radius?
How does the atomic radius change across a period?

Explain why the atomic radius of hydrogen is so much smaller that the atomic radius for potassium.
atomic radius:
The atomic radius is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of identical atoms that are bonded together.
Periodic Trends:
Ionization Energy
Define ionization energy.
Describe factors affecting ionization energy.
Describe how ionization energy changes across a period.
Describe how ionization energy changes down a group.
Sheep herds are like protons and electrons
Why do sheep travel in herds?
Like many other animals, sheep travel in herds.  The tendency is for each individual sheep to stay with the herd.
However, a sheep may sometimes wander off, depending on how strong the attraction is for a particular food or water supply.  At other times, a sheep may become frightened and run off.  Whether a sheep chooses to stay with the herd or go its own way depends on the balance between attraction to the herd and attraction to the outside influence.
There is an on-going tension between the electrons and protons in an atom.  Reactivity of the atom depends in part on how easily the electrons can be removed from the atom.  We can measure this quantity and use it to make predictions about the behaviors of atoms.
