Heterotrophs are found in all levels of an energy pyramid other than the first level.
This energy pyramid illustrates that many organisms on the bottom are needed to support the top carnivores
As illustrated by this ecological pyramid, it takes a lot of phytoplankton to support the carnivores of the oceans.
This energy pyramid has four trophic levels, which signify the organisms place in the food chain from the original source of energy.
As energy is transferred along a food chain, energy is lost as heat.
Only about 10% of energy of one step in a food chain is stored in the next step in the food chain.

What are three types of ecological pyramids?
How do their shapes compare?
Do you think it would be possible to construct a pyramid where the number of carnivores was more than the number of herbivores?
Why or why not?
Do you think it would be possible to construct a pyramid where the biomass of carnivores was more than the biomass of herbivores?
How does this compare to a numbers pyramid.
What consumes energy at each trophic level?
How does this contribute to energy loss between trophic levels?
When an herbivore eats a plant, what happens to 90% of the energy obtained from that plant?
What is a trophic level?
Why are the number of trophic levels limited?
