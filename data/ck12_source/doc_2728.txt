You probably recognize this image as the great seal of the United States.
The motto on the seal, E pluribus unum , is Latin for “out of many, one.” It refers to the formation of one country out of many states.
Large carbon compounds could have the same motto.
Can you guess why?
In this lesson, you’ll find out.
Out of Many, One
Carbon has a unique ability to form covalent bonds with many other atoms.
It can bond with other carbon atoms as well as with atoms of other elements.
Because of this ability, carbon often forms polymers.
A polymer is a large molecule that is made out of many smaller molecules that are joined together by covalent bonds.
The smaller, repeating molecules are called monomers . (The prefix mono - means “one” and the prefix poly - means “many.”) Polymers may consist of just one type of monomer or of more than one type.
Polymers are similar to the strings of beads pictured in the Figure below .
Like beads on a string, monomers in a polymer may be all the same or different from one another.

Natural Carbon Polymers
Many polymers of carbon occur naturally.
Two examples are rubber and cellulose.
Rubber is a natural polymer of the monomer named isoprene (C 5 H 8 ).
This polymer comes from rubber trees, which grow in tropical areas.
Structural formulas for rubber and isoprene are shown in the Figure below .
