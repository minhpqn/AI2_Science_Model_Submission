Explain the diffraction of light and the interference patterns that are produced through constructive and destructive interference of the waves.
Calculate diffraction pattern spacing or work backwards to calculate the wavelength of light emitted.
Students will learn about diffraction of light and the interference patterns that are produced through constructive and destructive interference of the waves.
Students will also learn to calculate diffraction pattern spacing or work backwards to calculate the wavelength of light emitted.
m \lambda = d \sin{\theta}
Double slit interference maxima. m is the order of the interference maximum in question, d is the distance between slits. and \theta is the angular position of the maximum.
m \lambda = d \sin{\theta}
Single slit interference maxima. m and \theta are defined as above and d is the width of the slit.
m \lambda = d \sin{\theta}
Diffraction grating interference maxima. m and \theta are defined as above and d is the distance between the lines on the grating.
m \lambda = 2nd
Thin film interference: n is the index of refraction of the film, d is the thickness of the film, and m is an integer.
In the film interference, there is a \lambda/2 delay (phase change) if the light is reflected from an object with an index of refraction greater than that of the incident material.
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_0} +\frac{1}{d_i}
Waves are characterized by their ability to constructively and destructively interfere .
Light waves which interfere with themselves after interaction with a small aperture or target are said to diffract .
Light creates interference patterns when passing through holes (“slits”) in an obstruction such as paper or the surface of a CD, or when passing through a thin film such as soap.
A typical experimental setup for an interference experiment will look something like this:
\text{Recall: for constructive interference we require a path difference of} \;m \lambda = d \sin{\theta}
