Epithelial tissue is made up of cells that line inner and outer body surfaces, such as the skin and the lining of the digestive tract.
Epithelial tissue protects the body and its internal organs, secretes substances such as hormones, and absorbs substances such as nutrients.
Muscle tissue is made up of cells that have the unique ability to contract, or become shorter.
Muscles attached to bones enable the body to move.
Nervous tissue is made up of neurons , or nerve cells, that carry electrical messages.
Nervous tissue makes up the brain and the nerves that connect the brain to all parts of the body.
Organs and Organ Systems
After tissues, organs are the next level of organization of the human body.
An organ is a structure that consists of two or more types of tissues that work together to do the same job.
Examples of human organs include the brain, heart, lungs, skin, and kidneys.
Human organs are organized into organ systems, many of which are shown in Figure below .
An organ system is a group of organs that work together to carry out a complex overall function.
Each organ of the system does part of the larger job.
You can watch overviews of the human organ systems and their functions at the links below.
An overview of the organ systems that make up the human body
Many of the organ systems that make up the human body are represented here.
What is the overall function of each organ system?
Your bodyâ€™s 12 organ systems are shown below ( Table below ).
Your organ systems do not work alone in your body.
They must all be able to work together.
