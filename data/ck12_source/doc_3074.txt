It is the ratio of the output force to the input force.
The force applied by the screw (output force) is always greater than the force applied to the screw (input force).
Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater than 1.
Look at the two screws in the Figure below .
In the screw on the right, the threads of the inclined plane are closer together.
This screw has a greater mechanical advantage and is easier to turn than the screw on the left, so it takes less force to penetrate the wood with the right screw.
The trade-off is that more turns of the screw are needed to do the job because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater.
Screws with different mechanical advantages
Q :
Why is it harder to turn a screw with more widely spaced threads?
A :
The screw moves farther with each turn when the threads are more widely space, so more force must be applied to turn the screw and cover the greater distance.
A screw is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane wrapped around a central cylinder.
Screws move objects to a greater depth (or higher elevation) by increasing the force applied to the screw
The mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater than 1 because the output force applied by the screw is greater than the input force applied to the screw.
Do the simple screw activity described at the following URL, and then answer the questions below.
How does the activity model a screw?
