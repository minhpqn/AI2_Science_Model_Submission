initiation :
The start of transcription; signaled by the transcription initiation complex formed by the promoter, transcription factors, and RNA polymerase; also refers to the start of translation.
P site :
Within the ribosome; contains the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain attached.
post-translational modification :
Modification of a polypeptide chain after translation; extends the range of functions of the protein.
quaternary structure :
Final protein structure involving two or more interacting polypeptide chains.
release factor :
A protein that allows for the termination of translation by recognizing the termination codon or stop codon in a mRNA sequence.
ribosome :
A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).
termination :
The end of transcription; involves the detachment of the RNA from the DNA template; also refers to the end of translation when the ribosome comes to one of the three stop codons, for which there is no tRNA.
transfer RNA (tRNA) :
Type of RNA that brings amino acids to ribosomes where they are joined together to form proteins.
translation :
The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.
During translation, a protein is synthesized using the codons in mRNA as a guide.
Translation involves the interactions of the three types of RNA: mRNA, rRNA and tRNA.
