ATP : ( adenosine triphosphate ):
Energy-carrying molecule that cells use to power their metabolic processes; energy-currency of the cell.
carbon-oxygen cycle :
The movement of carbon and oxygen between the ground, atmosphere, oceans, and living organisms.
cellular respiration :
Metabolic process which transfers chemical energy from glucose (a deliverable fuel molecule) to ATP (a usable energy-rich molecule); most efficient in the presence of oxygen (aerobic).
enzyme :
Chemical, usually a protein, that speeds up chemical reactions in organisms; a biological catalyst.
glucose :
The carbohydrate product of photosynthesis; serves as the universal fuel for life;
C 6 H 12 O 6 .
hydrocarbon :
An organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon.
mitochondria : (singular, mitochondrion ):
Membrane-enclosed organelles that are found in most eukaryotic cells; called the "power plants" of the cell because they use energy from organic compounds to make ATP.
product :
Substance that forms as a result of a chemical reaction.
reactant :
