Water as a Solvent
Salt isn’t the only solute that dissolves in water.
In fact, so many things dissolve in water that water is sometimes called the universal solvent.
Water is such a good solvent because it is a very polar compound.
A polar compound has positively and negatively charged ends.
Solutes that are also charged are attracted to the oppositely charged ends of water molecules.
This allows the water molecules to pull the solute particles apart.
On the other hand, there are some substances that don’t dissolve in water.
Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush with water after painting with an oil-based paint?
It doesn’t work.
Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so its particles aren’t charged.
As a result, oil-based paint doesn’t dissolve in water. (You can see how to dissolve oil-based paint in the Figure below .)
Non-polar paint thinner is used to dissolve non-polar oil based paints
To dissolve a nonpolar solute such as oil-based paint, a nonpolar solvent such as paint thinner must be used.
Like Dissolves Like
These examples illustrate a general rule about solutes and solvents: like dissolves like.
In other words, polar solvents dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes.
