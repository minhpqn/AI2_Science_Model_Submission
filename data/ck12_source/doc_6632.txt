Perhaps you learned some behaviors on your own, just by practicing.
Other behaviors you may have learned from other people.
Humans and other animals can learn behaviors in several different ways.
The following methods of learning will be explored below:
Habituation (forming a habit)
Habituation is learning to get used to something after being exposed to it for a while.
Habituation usually involves getting used to something that is annoying or frightening, but not dangerous.
Habituation is one of the simplest ways of learning.
It occurs in just about every species of animal.
You have probably learned through habituation many times.
For example, maybe you were reading a book when someone turned on a television in the same room.
At first, the sound of the television may have been annoying.
After a while, you may no longer have noticed it.
If so, you had become habituated to the sound.
Another example of habituation is shown below ( Figure below ).
Crows and most other birds are usually afraid of people.
They avoid coming close to people, or they fly away when people come near them.
The crows landing on this scarecrow have become used to a “human” in this place.
They have learned that the scarecrow poses no danger.
They are no longer afraid to come close.
