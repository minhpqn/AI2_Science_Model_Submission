Fossil Fuel Reserves
Describe the alternative fossil fuels.

Take a trip to Washington, D.C.?
People are always protesting in our nation's capital.
That's part of liberty, part of democracy.

Other people in other locations may be protesting for the pipeline.
The Keystone Pipeline would bring crude oil from tar sands to the United States.
People in favor say the oil from tar sands will bring down energy costs and provide jobs.
People opposed say that the environmental consequences are not worth the benefits.

Easy-to-reach fossil fuel sources are being used up.
Technologies are being developed to get at harder-to-reach sources.
Also, ways to tap into alternative sources of fossil fuels are increasingly being developed.
These sources include oil shale and tar sands.
