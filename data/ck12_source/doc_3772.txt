Is it possible for two single-celled organisms to have a symbiotic relationship?
As you will find out, yes it is!
Evolution of Eukaryotes
Our own eukaryotic cells protect DNA in chromosomes with a nuclear membrane, make ATP with mitochondria, move with flagella (in the case of sperm cells), and feed on cells which make our food with chloroplasts.
All multicellular organisms and the unicellular Protists share this cellular intricacy.
Bacterial (prokaryotic) cells are orders of magnitude smaller and have none of this complexity.
What quantum leap in evolution created this vast chasm of difference?
The first eukaryotic cells - cells with a nucleus an internal membrane-bound organelles - probably evolved about 2 billion years ago.
This is explained by the endosymbiotic theory .
As shown in the Figure below , endosymbiosis came about when large cells engulfed small cells.
The small cells were not digested by the large cells.
Instead, they lived within the large cells and evolved into organelles.
From Independent Cell to Organelle.
The endosymbiotic theory explains how eukaryotic cells evolved.
The large and small cells formed a symbiotic relationship in which both cells benefited.
Some of the small cells were able to break down the large cellâ€™s wastes for energy.
They supplied energy not only to themselves but also to the large cell.
They became the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.
Other small cells were able to use sunlight to make food.
They shared the food with the large cell.
