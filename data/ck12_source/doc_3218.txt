In which category does it belong?
How do you think it makes sounds and changes pitch?
State what sonar is and how it is used.
Explain how ultrasound is used to “see” inside the human body.
What could this smiling dolphin and yawning bat possibly have in common?
It’s not just that both of them are mammals.
Both of them also use ultrasound to find things in the dark.
What Is Ultrasound?
Ultrasound is sound that has a wave frequency higher than the human ear can detect.
It includes all sound with wave frequencies higher than 20,000 waves per second, or 20,000 hertz (Hz).
Although we can’t hear ultrasound, it is very useful to humans and some other animals.
Uses of ultrasound include echolocation, sonar, and ultrasonography.
Animals such as bats and dolphins send out ultrasound waves and use their echoes, or reflected waves, to identify the locations of objects they cannot see.
This is called echolocation.
Animals use echolocation to find prey and avoid running into objects in the dark.
You can see in the Figure below and also at the following URL how a bat uses echolocation to find insect prey.
Bats use echolocation to identify the location of objects
Sonar uses ultrasound in a way that is similar to echolocation.
Sonar stands for so und na vigation and r anging.
It is used to locate underwater objects such as submarines.
