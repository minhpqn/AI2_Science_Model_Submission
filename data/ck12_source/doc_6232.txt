When a flower is done blooming or a fruit is ripe and ready to be eaten, ethylene causes the petals or fruit to fall from a plant ( Figure below and Figure below ).
Ethylene is an unusual plant hormone because it is a gas.
That means it can move through the air, and a ripening apple can cause another apple to ripen, or even over-ripen.
That’s why one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel!
Some farmers spray their green peppers with ethylene gas to cause them to ripen faster and become red peppers.
You can try to see how ethylene works by putting a ripe apple or banana with another unripe fruit in a closed container or paper bag.
What do you think will happen to the unripe fruit?

Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow.
When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer.
Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants.
Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ).
Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds.
Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.
Dwarf plants like this bonsai tree often have unusually low concentrations of gibberellins

Cytokinins are hormones that cause plant cells to divide.
