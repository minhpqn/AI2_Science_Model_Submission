The earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure on all objects with which it is in contact.
Atmospheric pressure acting on a fluid is transmitted throughout that fluid.
For example, the water pressure at 100. m below the surface of a lake is 9.8 × 10 5 Pa.  The total pressure at that point, however, is the pressure of the water plus the pressure of the air above the water.  The pressure of the air at the surface of the water is 1.0 × 10 5 Pa, or 1 atm (atmosphere).  Therefore, the total pressure at 100. m below the surface of the water is 9.8 × 10 5 Pa + 1.0 × 10 5 Pa = 10.8 × 10 5 Pa.
This is an example of Pascal’s Principle , which states that pressure applied to a confined liquid increases the pressure throughout by the same amount.  A number of practical devices take advantage of this principle.  Hydraulic brakes, hydraulic lifts , and hydraulic presses are three useful tools that make use of Pascal’s Principle.
The sketch below is an example of a hydraulic lift.  We have a confined liquid in contact with two pistons ( A and B ) of different sizes.
The pressure of the liquid on these two pisons is the same (Pascal's principle).
Therefore, F_A=F_B ,
and     \frac{F_A}{A_A}=\frac{F_B}{A_B} and \frac{F_A}{F_B}=\frac{A_A}{A_B} .
Suppose that the area of piston  A is 4.0 cm 2 and the area of piston B is 200. cm 2 .  If we place an automobile weighing 10,000 N on piston B , we can lift that car by exerting a force of 200 N on piston A .  This is another form of  simple machine and its ideal mechanical advantage is 50.  The ideal mechanical advantage of a hydraulic lift equals the ratio of the large piston area to the small piston area.
