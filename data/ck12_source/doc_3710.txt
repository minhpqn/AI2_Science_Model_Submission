What molecule determines many of your traits?
Biology of the Molecule.
The Molecular Biology chapter focuses on DNA and proteins, and specifically how the "instructions" in DNA are used to make proteins.
This model depicts a protein binding to DNA.
Notice the "spiral staircase" shape of the DNA molecule, with the globular wrapped protein around it.
Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
State and explain the central dogma of molecular biology.
Is it always DNA to RNA to proteins?
The central dogma of molecular biology.
Coined by Francis Crick.
And in his own words, "I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect.
I had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful."
Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
Your DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the genes that determine who you are.
How can this organic molecule control your characteristics?
DNA contains instructions for all the proteins your body makes.
Proteins , in turn, determine the structure and function of all your cells.
What determines a proteinâ€™s structure?
It begins with the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein.
Instructions for making proteins with the correct sequence of amino acids are encoded in DNA.
