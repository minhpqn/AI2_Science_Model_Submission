permanent magnet:
A piece of magnetic material that retains its magnetism after it is removed from a magnetic field.
Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields
Understand the shape of magnetic fields produced by moving current.
Understand the effect of a magnetic field on a moving charged particle.
Explain the direction of the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field.
Solve problems involving using the right and left hand rules.
Electromagnet lifting scrap metal
Powerful electromagnets are commonly used for industrial lifting.
Here, a magnet is lifting scrap iron and loading it onto a railroad car for transporting to a scrap iron recovery plant.
Other uses for lifting magnets include moving cars in a junk yard, lifting rolls of steel sheeting, and lifting large steel parts for various machines.
Electromagnets are usually used for these jobs because they are magnets only when the electric current is on.
The magnet will hold the iron object when the current is on and release it when the current is off.
Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields
Electricity and magnetism are inextricably linked.
Under certain conditions, electric current causes a magnetic field.
Under other conditions, a magnetic field can cause an electric current.
A moving charged particle creates a magnetic field around it.
Additionally, when a moving charged particle moves through a different magnetic field, the two magnetic fields will interact.
The result is a force exerted on the moving charged particle.
