Synthetic Biology
Can biotechnology be extended to develop new technologies based on biological systems?
Imagine living cells acting as memory devices, biofuels brewing from yeast, or a light receptor taken from algae that makes photographs on a plate of bacteria.
The new biotechnology field of Synthetic Biology is making biological systems easier to engineer, so that new functions can be derived and developed from living systems.
