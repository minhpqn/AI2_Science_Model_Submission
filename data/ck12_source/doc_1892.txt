Fossils of ocean animals are found at the top of Mt.
Everest.
Mt.
Everest is the highest mountain on Earth.
These fossils show that the area was once at the bottom of a sea.
The seabed was later uplifted to form the Himalaya mountain range.
Fossils of plants are found in Antarctica.
Currently, Antarctica is almost completely covered with ice.
The fossil plants show that Antarctica once had a much warmer climate.
Fossil of a fish found in the Wyoming desert
What can we learn from fossil clues like this fish fossil found in the Wyoming desert?
Fossils are used to determine the ages of rock layers.
Index fossils are the most useful for this.
Index fossils are of organisms that lived over a wide area.
They lived for a fairly short period of time.
An index fossil allows a scientist to determine the age of the rock it is in.
Trilobite fossils ( Figure below ) are common index fossils.
Trilobites were widespread marine animals.
They lived between 500 and 600 million years ago.
Rock layers containing trilobite fossils must be that age.
