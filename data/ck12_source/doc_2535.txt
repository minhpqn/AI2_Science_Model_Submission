Atoms consist of several types of smaller particles, including protons, neutrons, and electrons.

The Billiard Ball Model
Because Dalton thought atoms were the smallest particles of matter, he envisioned them as solid, hard spheres, like billiard (pool) balls, so he used wooden balls to model them.
Three of his model atoms are pictured in the Figure below .
Do you see the holes in the balls?
Dalton added these so the model atoms could be joined together with hooks and used to model compounds.
Dalton's model of atoms
Q:
When scientists discovered smaller particles inside the atom, they realized that Dalton’s atomic models were too simple.
How do modern atomic models differ from Dalton’s models?
A:
Modern atomic models, like the one pictured at the top of this article, usually represent subatomic particles, including electrons, protons, and neutrons.

Around 1800, the English chemist John Dalton reintroduced the idea of the atom, which was first introduced by the ancient Greek philosopher named Democritus.
Dalton did many experiments with gases and compounds that provided evidence for the existence of atoms.
