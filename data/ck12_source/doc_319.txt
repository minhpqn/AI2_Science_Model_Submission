The four main types of tissue are nervous tissue, epithelial tissue, connective tissue, and muscle tissue
Your body has four main types of tissue: nervous tissue, epithelial tissue, connective tissue, and muscle tissue.
They are found throughout your body.
Epithelial tissue is made up of layers of tightly packed cells that line the surfaces of the body.
Examples of epithelial tissue include the skin, the lining of the mouth and nose, and the lining of the digestive system.
Connective tissue is made up of many different types of cells that are all involved in supporting and binding other tissues of the body.
Examples include tendon, cartilage, and bone.
Blood is also classified as a specialized connective tissue.
Muscle tissue is made up of bands of cells that contract and allow movement.
Nervous tissue is made up of nerve cells that sense stimuli and transmit signals.
Nervous tissue is found in nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain.

A single tissue alone cannot do all the jobs that are needed to keep you alive and healthy.
Two or more tissues working together can do a lot more.
An organ is a structure made of two or more tissues that work together.
The heart ( Figure below ) is made up of the four types of tissues.
