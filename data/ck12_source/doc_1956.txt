Scientists estimate that there may be about 8.7 million species in all.
Why does the planet have so much biological diversity? (Biological diversity is shortened to biodiversity .) The tremendous variety of organisms is due to the tremendous numbers of habitats that they have evolved to fill.
Ways to Live in the Environment
Each organism has the ability to survive in a specific environment.
Dry desert environments are difficult to live in.
Desert plants have special stems and leaves to conserve water ( Figure below ).
Animals have other ways to live in the desert.
The Namib Desert receives only 1.5 inches of rainfall each year.
The Namib Desert beetle lives there.
How do the beetles get enough water to survive?
Early morning fog deposits water droplets.
The droplets collect on a beetle's wings and back ( Figure below ).
The beetle tilts its rear end up.
When the droplet is heavy enough, it slides forward.
It lands in the beetleâ€™s mouth.
There are many other environments that need unique approaches for survival ( Figure below and below ).
