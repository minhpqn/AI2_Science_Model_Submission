Oxidation and reduction must happen together.
Neither can happen alone in a reaction.
Reduction can also be considered as a gain of hydrogen.
The reverse of the ethanol â†’ acetaldehyde reaction shown above is a reduction reaction:
\text{CH}_3\text{CHO} + 2\text{H atoms} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}
Oxidation and reduction are defined in terms of reactions with oxygen.
Oxidation and reduction reactions must occur together.

oxidation:
A process in which a substance was reacted with oxygen to produce one or more oxides or a reaction involving the loss of hydrogen.
reduction:
Removal of oxygen from a substance or the addition of hydrogen to a substance.
