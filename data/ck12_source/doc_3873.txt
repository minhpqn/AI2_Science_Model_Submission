Draw a terrestrial food chain that includes four trophic levels.
Identify the trophic level of each organism in the food chain.
Define biogeochemical cycle.
Compare an exchange pool to a reservoir.
Describe the water cycle and its processes.
Compare evaporation to sublimation and to transpiration.
Explain the roles of condensation and precipitation in the water cycle.
Where does the water come from that is needed by your cells?
Unlike energy, matter is not lost as it passes through an ecosystem.
Instead, matter, including water, is recycled.
This recycling involves specific interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem.
Chances are, the water you drank this morning has been around for millions of years, or more.
The Water Cycle
The chemical elements and water that are needed by organisms continuously recycle in ecosystems.
They pass through biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere.
Thatâ€™s why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles .
For example, a chemical might move from organisms ( bio ) to the atmosphere or ocean ( geo ) and back to organisms again.
Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a cycle.
Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a short period of time is called an exchange pool .
For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water.
