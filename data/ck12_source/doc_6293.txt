The figure below illustrates the difference.
In the first collision, the particles bounce off one another and no rearrangement of atoms has occurred.
The second collision occurs with greater kinetic energy, and so the bond between the two red atoms breaks.
One red atom bonds with the other molecule as one product, while the single red atom is the other product.
The first collision is called an ineffective collision , while the second collision is called an effective collision .
Only effective collisions result in product formation
An ineffective collision (A) is one that does not result in product formation.
An effective collision (B) is one in which chemical bonds are broken and a product is formed.
Collision theory explains how materials can collide and become new materials.

Two molecules collide and then bounce off of one another.
What kind of collision is that?
collision theory:
A set of principles that states that the reacting particles can form products when they collide with one another, provided those collisions have enough kinetic energy and the correct orientation.
