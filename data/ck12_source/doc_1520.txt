The air feels very heavy and sticky.
On a winter day in Flagstaff, Arizona, humidity is low.
The air sucks moisture out of your nose and lips.
Humidity can change rapidly if a storm comes in.
Humidity can vary over a short distance, like near a lake.
Even when humidity is at its highest, water vapor makes up only about 4% of the atmosphere.
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere.
This is essential so that Earth has a more moderate temperature.
Without greenhouse gases, nighttime temperatures would be frigid.
Natural greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone.
CFCs and some other man-made compounds are also greenhouse gases.
Human activities may increase the amount of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere.
Particles in the Air
Air includes many tiny particles.
The particulates may consist of dust, soil, salt, smoke, or ash.
Some particulates pollute the air and may make it unhealthy to breathe.
But having particles in the air is very important.
Tiny particles are needed for water vapor to condense on.
Without particles, water vapor could not condense.
Then clouds could not form, and Earth would have no rain.
