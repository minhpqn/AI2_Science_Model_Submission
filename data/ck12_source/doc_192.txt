Without calculus, we approximate the instantaneous velocity at a particular point by laying a straight edge along the curved line and estimating the slope.
The position versus time graph shows accelerated motion as a curved line
In the image above, the red line is the position vs time graph and the blue line is an approximated slope for the line at t = 2.5 \ \text{seconds} .  The rise for this slope is approximately 170 m and the time interval (run) is 4.0 seconds.  Therefore, the approximated slope is 43 m/s.
The slope of a position versus time graph is the velocity.
For constant velocity motion, the slope gives the constant velocity, the average velocity, and the instantaneous velocity at every point.
For constant acceleration motion, the slope of the position versus time curve at a particular point gives the instantaneous velocity at that point.
Draw a velocity versus time graph for an object whose constant velocity is 15 m/s and whose position starts at  x = 0 when t = 0 .
Graph the motion for the first 5.0 seconds.
