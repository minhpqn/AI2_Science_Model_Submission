But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, even a solid.
Q:
How do the particles of the medium move when a wave passes through them?
A:
The particles of the medium just vibrate in place.
As they vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.
Particles of the medium donâ€™t actually travel along with the wave.
Only the energy of the wave travels through the medium.
Types of Mechanical Waves
There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves.
They differ in how particles of the medium move.
You can see this in the Figure below and in the animation at the following URL.
Diagram illustrating transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves
In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave.
In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction of the wave.
In a surface wave, particles of the medium vibrate both up and down and back and forth, so they end up moving in a circle.
Q:
How do you think surface waves are related to transverse and longitudinal waves?
A:
A surface wave is combination of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave.
