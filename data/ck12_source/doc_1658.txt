Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes.
They are diploid cells, with two sets of 23 chromosomes (23 pairs).
Fish and other aquatic animals release their gametes in the water, which is called external fertilization ( Figure below ).
These gametes will combine by chance.
Animals that live on land (reptiles, birds, and mammals) reproduce by internal fertilization .
Typically males have a penis that deposits sperm into the vagina of the female.
Birds do not have penises, but they do have a chamber called the cloaca that they place close to another bird’s cloaca to deposit sperm.
Amphibians must live close to water as they must lay their eggs in a moist or wet environment prior to external fertilization.
Fish eggs are fertilized externally
This fish guards her eggs, which will be fertilized externally.
Plants can also reproduce sexually, but their reproductive organs are different from animals’ gonads.
Plants that have flowers have their reproductive parts in the flower.
The sperm is contained in the pollen, while the egg is contained in the ovary, deep within the flower.
The sperm can reach the egg two different ways:
In self-pollination , the egg is fertilized by the pollen of the same flower.
In cross-pollination , sperm from the pollen of one flower fertilizes the egg of another flower.
Like other types of sexual reproduction, cross-pollination allows new combinations of traits.
Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is carried by the wind to another flower.
It can also occur when animal pollinators, like honeybees or butterflies ( Figure below ), carry the pollen from flower to flower.
Butterflies cross-pollinate flowers
