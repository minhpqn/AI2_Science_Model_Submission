As you view DNA, focus on the following concept:
the structure and role of DNA.
Structure of Nucleic Acids
Each nucleotide consists of three smaller molecules:
If you look at Figure below , you will see that the sugar of one nucleotide binds to the phosphate group of the next nucleotide.
These two molecules alternate to form the backbone of the nucleotide chain.
This backbone is known as the sugar-phosphate backbone.
The nitrogen bases in a nucleic acid stick out from the backbone.
There are four different types of bases: cytosine (C), adenine (A), guanine (G), and either thymine (T) in DNA, or uracil (U) in RNA.
In DNA, bonds form between bases on the two nucleotide chains and hold the chains together.
Each type of base binds with just one other type of base: cytosine always binds with guanine, and adenine always binds with thymine.
These pairs of bases are called complementary base pairs
Structure of a nucleic acid
Nucleic Acid.
Sugars and phosphate groups form the backbone of a polynucleotide chain.
Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases hold two polynucleotide chains together.
The binding of complementary bases allows DNA molecules to take their well-known shape, called a double helix , which is shown in Figure below .
A double helix is like a spiral staircase.
