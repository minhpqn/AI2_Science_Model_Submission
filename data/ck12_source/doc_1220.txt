It was not hot enough to melt all the way.
Metamorphic rocks start off as some kind of rock.
The starting rock can be igneous, sedimentary, or even another metamorphic rock.
Heat and/or pressure then change the rock into a metamorphic rock.
The change can be physical, chemical, or both.
During metamorphism, a rock may change chemically.
Ions move in or out of a mineral.
This creates a different mineral.
The new minerals that form during metamorphism are more stable in the new environment.
Extreme pressure may lead to physical changes.
If pressure is exerted on the rock from one direction, the rock forms layers.
This is foliation .
If pressure is exerted from all directions, the rock usually does not show foliation.
There are two main types of metamorphism: contact and regional.
Contact metamorphism results when magma contacts a rock.
The rock changes because of the magma's extreme heat ( Figure below ).
Hornfels is a metamorphic rock that makes up the Rocky Mountains
(A) Hornfels is a rock that is created by contact metamorphism. (B) Hornfels is so hard that it can create peaks like the Rocky Mountains.
Regional metamorphism occurs over a wide area.
Great masses of rock are exposed to pressure from rock and sediment layers on top of it.
