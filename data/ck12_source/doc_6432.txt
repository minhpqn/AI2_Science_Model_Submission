Salt formed from:
Strong acid + Strong base
Strong acid + Weak base
Weak acid + Strong base
Salts formed from the reaction of a weak acid and a weak base are more difficult to analyze because of competing hydrolysis reactions between the cation and the anion.
These salts will not be considered in this concept.
Salt hydrolysis is defined.
Salt hydrolysis reactions resulting in acidic, basic, or neutral solutions are described.
Do problems 1, 2, 3, and 5 at the link below:
How does F âˆ’ produce a basic solution?
How does the ammonium ion produce an acidic solution?
Why does dissolved NaCl produce a neutral solution?
salt hydrolysis:
A reaction in which one of the ions from a salt reacts with water, forming either an acidic or basic solution.
Calculating pH of Salt Solutions
Perform calculations to determine pH of salt solutions if  K_a or K_b are known.
A swimming pool is kept around a pH of 7.2 using various acidic and basic salts
Keeping things safe and healthy
We all enjoy a cool dip in a swimming pool on a hot day, but we may not realize the work needed to keep that water safe and healthy.
The ideal pH for a swimming pool is around 7.2.
