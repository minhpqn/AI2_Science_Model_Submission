Fish at Risk
Today, more than 1,000 species of fish are at risk of extinction.
This is mainly because of human actions.
Specific causes include over-fishing and habitat destruction caused by water pollution, dam building, and the introduction of non-native species.
The evolution of fish included a shift from using the gills for filtering food to using them to absorb oxygen from water.
The earliest fish, resembling living hagfish, evolved about 550 million years ago.
Adaptations that eventually evolved in fish include a complete vertebral column, jaws, and an endoskeleton made of bones instead of cartilage.
Fish live throughout the ocean and in freshwater lakes and streams.
Most fish are predators, but the nature of their prey and how they consume it may vary.
Many species of fish are threatened by human actions, such as water pollution and overfishing.
