Small molecules, such as those present in the early atmosphere, can provide the components (including the elements C, H, N, O and S) to make larger molecules.
These early molecules further reacted and eventually formed even larger molecules and organic compounds , such as amino acids (and then proteins), and nucleotides (which form nucleic acids - RNA or DNA).
These molecules eventually came together in the right combinations to form basic cells.
The components that were necessary for the formation of the first cells are still being studied.
How long did it take to develop the first life forms?
As much as 1 billion years.
Many scientists still study the origin of the first life forms because there are many questions left unanswered, such as, "Did proteins or nucleic acids develop first?" or "What exactly were early Earth's atmospheric conditions like?" There is a lot of work still left to answer these and similar questions.
The Grand Prismatic Spring at Yellowstone
Some clues to the origins of life on Earth come from studying the early life forms that developed in hot springs, such as the Grand Prismatic Spring at Yellowstone National Park.
This spring is approximately 250 feet deep and 300 feet wide.
Life has probably existed on Earth for most of Earthâ€™s history.
Life on Earth came from random reactions between chemical compounds, which formed molecules.
