Radioisotopes and Radioactive Decay
A radioisotope has atoms with unstable nuclei.
Unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break down.
They lose energy and particles and become more stable.
As nuclei decay, they gain or lose protons, so the atoms become different elements.
This is illustrated in the Figure below .
The original, unstable nucleus is called the parent nucleus.
After it loses a particle (in this case a type of particle called an alpha particle), it forms a daughter nucleus, with a different number of protons.
The nucleus of a given radioisotope decays at a constant rate that is unaffected by temperature, pressure, or other conditions outside the nucleus.
This rate of decay is called the half-life.
The half-life is the length of time it takes for half of the original amount of the radioisotope to decay to another element.
Q:
How can the half-life of a radioisotope be used to date a rock?
A:
After a rock forms, nuclei of a radioisotope inside the rock start to decay.
As they decay, the amount of the original, or parent, isotope decreases, while the amount of its stable decay product, or daughter isotope, increases.
By measuring the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes and knowing the rate of decay, scientists can determine how long the parent isotope has been decaying.
This provides an estimate of the rockâ€™s age.
Different Isotopes, Different Half-Lives
Different radioisotopes decay at different rates.
