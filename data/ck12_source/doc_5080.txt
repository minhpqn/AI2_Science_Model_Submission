The process for making ATP in the absence of oxygen; converts glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
facultative anaerobe :
An organism which can respire aerobically when oxygen is present, but is also capable of fermentation when oxygen levels are low.
fermentation :
Type of anaerobic respiration that includes glycolysis followed by the conversion of pyruvic acid to one or more other compounds and the formation of NAD + ; the process of producing ATP in the absence of oxygen through glycolysis.
lactic acid fermentation :
The process for making ATP in the absence of oxygen; converts glucose to lactic acid.
obligate aerobe :
An organism which requires oxygen for cellular respiration.
obligate anaerobe :
An organism which uses anaerobic respiration, and dies in the presence of oxygen.
In the two to three billion years since photosynthesis added oxygen to earthâ€™s atmosphere, life has become mostly aerobic.
Some organisms and types of cells retain the older, anaerobic pathways for making ATP; these pathways comprise anaerobic respiration or fermentation.
Obligate aerobes require oxygen to make ATP.
Facultative anaerobes make ATP with oxygen, but if oxygen levels become low, they can use fermentation.
What are the two paths of fermentation and how do they differentiate?
Describe obligate aerobes, obligate anaerobes, or facultative anaerobes, and give examples.
Lactic Acid Fermentation - Advanced
Describe lactic acid fermentation.
Describe how bacteria, including those we employ to make yogurt, make ATP in the absence of oxygen.
