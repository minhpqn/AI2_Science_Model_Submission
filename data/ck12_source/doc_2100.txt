Why is the waste from nuclear power plants dangerous for so long?
Why should nuclear power be developed?
Why should nuclear power not be developed?
Explain how solar energy is collected and used.
Why don't we get our energy straight from the source?
The Sun produces far more energy than humans can use.
The Sun is also the source of most of the energy we use.
Fossil fuels and wind energy, for example, originate with the Sun.
So why don't we get all our energy from the Sun?
For one reason, it's not always practical.

Solar energy is clean and renewable.
Solar panels are needed to collect the sunlight for use.
Solar energy is clean and renewable.
Earth receives many times more solar energy than humans could ever imagine using.
Energy from the Sun
The Sun is Earthâ€™s main source of energy.
The Sun gives us both light and heat.
The Sun changes hydrogen into helium through nuclear fusion.
This releases huge amounts of energy.
