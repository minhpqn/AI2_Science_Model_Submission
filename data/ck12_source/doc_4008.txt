Compare the structures of a prokaryote and a virus.
If you prefer, you may draw a diagram of each and label the different parts of each structure.
Describe how viruses are classified.
List the four types of nucleic acid found in viruses.
How are viruses classified?
In part by their shape.
This picture represents a bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria.
Notice the distinctive shape.
This virus has a complex shape.
Classification of Viruses
Like the classification systems for cellular organisms, virus classification is the subject of ongoing debate.
This is largely due to the nature of viruses, which are not living organisms by the classic definition, but neither are they necessarily non-living.
Therefore, viruses do not fit neatly into the biological classification system of cellular organisms, as plants and animals do.
Virus classification is based mainly on characteristics of the viral particles, including the capsid shape, the type of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA, double stranded (ds) or single stranded (ss)) within the capsid, the process of replication, their host organisms, or the type of disease they cause.
The Table below lists characteristics such as capsid shape, presence of an envelope, and the diseases the viruses can cause.
upper respiratory infections
fifth disease, Canine parvovirus
Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein Barr virus
Herpes, chicken pox, shingles, infectious mononucleosis
Hepatitis B virus
