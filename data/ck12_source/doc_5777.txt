Atomic radii of the representative elements measured in picometers.
The atomic radius of atoms generally decreases from left to right across a period.
There are some small exceptions, such as the oxygen radius being slightly greater than the nitrogen radius.
Within a period, protons are added to the nucleus as electrons are being added to the same principal energy level.
These electrons are gradually pulled closer to the nucleus because of its increased positive charge.
Since the force of attraction between nuclei and electrons increases, the size of the atoms decreases.
The effect lessens as one moves further to the right in a period because of electron-electron repulsions that would otherwise cause the atomâ€™s size to increase.
The atomic radius of atoms generally increases from top to bottom within a group.
As the atomic number increases down a group, there is again an increase in the positive nuclear charge.
However, there is also an increase in the number of occupied principle energy levels.
Higher principal energy levels consist of orbitals which are larger in size than the orbitals from lower energy levels.
The effect of the greater number of principal energy levels outweighs the increase in nuclear charge and so atomic radius increases down a group.

Each successive period is shown in a different color.
As the atomic number increases within a period, the atomic radius decreases.
Atomic radius is determined as the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms bonded together.
