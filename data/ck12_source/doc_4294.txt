The mantle is a layer of tissue that lies between the shell and the body.
It secretes calcium carbonate to form the shell.
It forms a cavity, called the mantle cavity , between the mantle and the body.
The mantle cavity pumps water for filter feeding.
The radula is a feeding organ with teeth made of chitin.
It is located in front of the mouth in the head region.
Herbivorous mollusks use the radula to scrape food such as algae off rocks.
Predatory mollusks use the radula to drill holes in the shells of their prey.
Mollusks have a coelom and a complete digestive system.
Their excretory system consists of tube-shaped organs called nephridia (see Figure above ).
The organs filter waste from body fluids and release the waste into the coelom.
Terrestrial mollusks exchange gases with the surrounding air.
This occurs across the lining of the mantle cavity.
Aquatic mollusks “breathe” under water with gills.
Gills are thin filaments that absorb gases and exchange them between the blood and surrounding water.
Mollusks have a circulatory system with one or two hearts that pump blood.
The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system when its muscles contract.
The circulatory system may be open or closed, depending on the species.
The major classes of mollusks vary in structure and function.
You can read about some of their differences in Figure below .
