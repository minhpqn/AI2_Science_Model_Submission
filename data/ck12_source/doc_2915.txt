If two individuals have a certain phenotype, does that mean they must have the same genotype?
A tall, green plant is homozygous for each trait.
If T is the tall allele, and G is the green allele, what is the genotype and the phenotype of this plant?
Distinguish incomplete dominance from codominance.
Describe the genetics of ABO blood types in humans.
How would Mendel explain blood types?
The inheritance of traits is not always as simple as Mendel's rules.
Each characteristic Mendel investigated was controlled by one gene that had only two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant over the other.
We now know that inheritance is often more complicated than this.
In blood types, for example, there are actually three alleles instead of two.
And some traits even have more than three alleles.
Exceptions to Mendel's Rules
In all of Mendel’s experiments, he worked with traits where a single gene controlled the trait.
Each also had one allele that was always dominant over the recessive allele.
But this is not always true.
There are exceptions to Mendel’s rules, and these exceptions usually have something to do with the dominant allele.
If you cross a homozygous red flower with a homozygous white flower, according to Mendel's laws, what color flower should result from the cross?
Either a completely red or completely white flower, depending on which allele is dominant.
But since Mendel's time, scientists have discovered this is not always the case.
One allele is NOT always completely dominant over another allele.
