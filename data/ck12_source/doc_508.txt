Injuries to the central nervous system may damage tissues of the brain or spinal cord.
If an injury is mild, a person may have a full recovery.
If an injury is severe, it may cause permanent disability or even death.
Brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur because of car crashes or sports accidents.
The best way to deal with such injuries is to try to prevent them.
Brain injuries can range from mild to extremely severe, but even mild injuries need medical attention.
Brain injuries can result from falls, car accidents, violence, sports injuries, and war and combat.
Falls are the most common cause of brain injuries, particularly in older adults and young children.
The mildest and most common type of brain injury is a concussion .
This is a bruise on the surface of the brain.
It may cause temporary problems such as headache, drowsiness, and confusion.
Most concussions in young people occur when they are playing sports, especially contact sports like football.
Other sports, like soccer, boxing, baseball, lacrosse, skateboarding, and hockey can also result in concussions.
A concussion normally heals on its own in a few days.
A single concussion is unlikely to cause permanent damage.
But repeated concussions may lead to lasting problems.
People who have had two or more concussions may have life-long difficulties with memory, learning, speech, or balance.
For this reason, concussions are treated very seriously among athletes and in professional sports.
