A virus is essentially genetic material surrounded by protein.
That's it.
So, is a virus prokaryotic or eukaryotic?
Or neither?
Or both?
Are Viruses Prokaryotic or Eukaryotic?
A virus is a sub-microscopic particle that can infect living cells.
Viruses are much smaller than prokaryotic organisms.
In essence, a virus is simply a nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat, as seen in the Figure below .
This outer coat is called a capsid .
Viruses will be discussed in more detail in the Viruses concepts.
Are viruses prokaryotic or eukaryotic?
Neither.
Viruses are not made up of cells, so they do not have a cell membrane or any cytoplasm, ribosomes, or other organelles, nor do they have their own metabolism.
The viral DNA (or sometimes RNA) encodes for proteins that make the capsid.
However, viruses cannot make their own proteins; they use the ribosomes of a host cell to make proteins.
A host cell is a cell infected by a virus.
Viruses do not reproduce by themselves, instead, they use their host cell to make additional copies of themselves.
The host cell both replicates the viral genome (DNA) and produces the viral capsid.
The viral genome is then packaged into the capsid, resulting in new viruses.
