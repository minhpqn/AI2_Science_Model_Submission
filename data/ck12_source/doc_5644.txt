How many electrons can there be in each type of orbital shown in the Figure above ?
A:
There can be a maximum of two electrons in any orbital, regardless of its shape.
Q:
Where is the nucleus in each orbital?
A:
The nucleus is at the center of each orbital.
It is in the middle of the sphere in the S orbital and in the pinched part of the P orbital.
What’s Your Energy Level?
Electrons are located at fixed distances from the nucleus, called energy levels.
You can see the first three energy levels in the Figure below .
The diagram also shows the maximum possible number of electrons at each energy level.
Electrons at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus, have less energy.
At the lowest energy level, which has the least energy, there is just one orbital, so this energy level has a maximum of two electrons.
Only when a lower energy level is full are electrons added to the next higher energy level.
Electrons at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus, have more energy.
They also have more orbitals and greater possible numbers of electrons.
Electrons at the outermost energy level of an atom are called valence electrons.
They determine many of the properties of an element.
That’s because these electrons are involved in chemical reactions with other atoms.
