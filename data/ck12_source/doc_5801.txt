Characteristics of Protists
A few characteristics are common between protists.
They are eukaryotic, which means they have a nucleus.
Most have mitochondria.
They can be parasites.
They all prefer aquatic or moist environments.
Classification of Protists
For classification, the protists are divided into three groups:
Animal-like protists, which are heterotrophs and have the ability to move.
Plant-like protists, which are autotrophs that photosynthesize.
Fungi-like protists, which are heterotrophs, and they have cells with cell walls and reproduce by forming spores.
But remember, protists are not animals, nor plants, nor fungi ( Figure below ).
Protists come in many different shapes
Protists come in many different shapes.
Some are very simple, similar to prokaryotes, and some are more complex.
These simple, single-celled protists were probably the first eukaryotes to evolve.
Protists are a diverse kingdom, including all eukaryotic organisms that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi.
For classification, the protists are divided into three groups: animal-like protists, plant-like protists, and fungi-like protists.
