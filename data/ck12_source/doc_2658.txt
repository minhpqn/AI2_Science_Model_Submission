Water is an example of a covalent compound that is a liquid at room temperature.
The boiling point of water is 100°C.
Covalent compounds contain two or more nonmetallic elements held together by covalent bonds, in which atoms share pairs of valence electrons.
A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound.
A few rules can be applied to name simple covalent compounds: name the left-most element in the periodic table first, add -ide to the second named element, and use prefixes for the numbers of atoms.
Covalent bonds are responsible for many of the properties of covalent compounds.
Covalent compounds have relatively low boiling points, cannot conduct electricity, and may not dissolve in water.

Describe polar and nonpolar covalent bonds.
Explain why some covalent compounds are polar.
Like the north and south poles of a bar magnet, Earth’s north and south magnetic poles—pictured above—are opposites in terms of their magnetic fields.
Some types of chemical bonds and chemical compounds have “poles” similar to a bar magnet as well.
But in the case of chemical bonds and compounds, the poles are opposites in terms of their electric charge.
These bonds and compounds are described as polar.
