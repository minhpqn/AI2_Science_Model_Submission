For years, arguably beginning with the rediscovery of Mendel's work in the early 1900s, scientists have known about heritable factors or genes.
Then in the 1940s and 1950s, when it was proved that DNA is the genetic material and has a triplet code made of just four bases, understanding the sequence of this code became the next significant endeavor.
How do you sequence the ACGTs?
The genetic code told us of the amino acids coded for by each codon, but it also told us that multiple codons could code for the same amino acid.
Would sequencing the human genome explain to us what it means to be human?
Maybe at a molecular level.
But even prior to undertaking such a large effort, sequencing small parts, even just small segments of a gene, would form the basis of DNA analysis and DNA technology.
But first methods to sequence DNA had to be developed.
Sequencing of DNA would allow the analysis of genes to become more feasible.
How big is a gene?
Where are the start and stop codons?
Where are the intron and exon junctions?
What is the gene's consensus sequence?
What are significant base changes within a gene?
