What is a Punnett square?
How is a Punnett squares useful?
Draw a Punnett square of an Ss Ã— ss cross.
The S allele codes for long stems in pea plants and the s allele codes for short stems.
If S is dominant to s , what percentage of the offspring would you expect to have each phenotype?
What letter should replace the question marks (?) in this Punnett square?
Explain how you know.
How do the Punnett squares for a monohybrid cross and a dihybrid cross differ?
Testcross - Advanced
Identify how a testcross is used to determine the genotype of an organism.
What if you wanted more cows with zebra stripes?
Is it a new dominant or recessive trait?
What is the genotype of the cow's parents?
To determine the genotypes, a testcross could be done.
Though with cows, this could take some time.
Testcross and Punnett Squares
If an individual has the dominant phenotype, is the genotype always known?
Not necessarily as both a homozygous dominant and heterozygous genotype can result in the same dominant phenotype.
