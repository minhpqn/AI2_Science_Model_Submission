This self-organization of phospholipids results in a semipermeable membrane which allows only certain molecules in or out of the cell.
The cell membrane also decides what may enter or leave a cell.
The membrane is said to be semipermeable or selectively permeable, allowing only certain ions and organic molecules to cross the membrane.
The plasma membrane contain many proteins, as well as other lipids called sterols.
The proteins have various functions, such as channels (channel proteins) that allow certain molecules into the cell, and receptors (receptor proteins) that bind to signal molecules.
In Figure above , the smaller (green) molecules shown between the phospholipids are cholesterol molecules.
Cholesterol helps keep the plasma membrane firm and stable over a wide range of temperatures.
At least ten different types of lipids are commonly found in plasma membranes.
Each type of cell or organelle will have a different percentage of each lipid, protein and carbohydrate.
cholesterol :
A steroid alcohol that is present in animal cells and body fluids, regulates membrane fluidity, and functions as a precursor molecule in various metabolic pathways.
hydrophilic :
Characteristic of the phospholipid head group; water-loving.
hydrophobic :
Characteristic of the phospholipid tails; water-hating.
phospholipid :
A major component of the cell membrane; consists of two hydrophobic tails and a hydrophilic phosphate head group.
phospholipid bilayer :
A bilayer (2 layers) of phospholipids that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment.
plasma membrane :
