Like all organisms, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their environment.
Their main response is to change how they grow.
Plant responses are controlled by hormones.
Some plant responses are tropisms.
Plants also respond to daily and seasonal cycles and to disease.
Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.

Describe the various plant responses:
What is the primary way that plants respond to environmental stimuli?
What controls their responses?
Define tropism.
Name one example in plants.
State ways that plants respond to disease.
Why is it adaptive for plants to detect and respond to daily and seasonal changes?
Plants is an in-depth look at the Kingdom Plantae, from small nonvascular plants to towering redwood trees.
It is probable that without plants, most life, including us, would not exist.
Why?
Photosynthesis.
This process brings energy into our ecosystems and produces the oxygen that all our cells need.
This concept discusses the types of plants, the structures of plants, the life cycles of plants, and the adaptations and responses of plants.
