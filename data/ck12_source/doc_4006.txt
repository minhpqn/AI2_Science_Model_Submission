Viral protein units, 3.
Capsid.
TMV causes tobacco mosaic disease in tobacco, cucumber, pepper, and tomato plants.
Icosahedral capsid symmetry gives viruses a spherical appearance at low magnification, but the protein subunits are actually arranged in a regular geometrical pattern, similar to a soccer ball; they are not truly spherical.
An icosahedral shape is the most efficient way of creating a hardy structure from multiple copies of a single protein.
This shape is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein which is used over and over again.
This saves space in the viral genome.
Adenovirus is a icosahedral virus
Adenovirus, an icosahedral virus.
An icosahedron is a three-dimensional shape made up of 20 equilateral triangles.
Viral structures are built of repeated identical protein subunits, making the icosahedron the easiest shape to assemble using these subunits.
Complex viruses possess a capsid which is neither purely helical, nor purely icosahedral, and which may have extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall.
Viral protein subunits will self-assemble into a capsid, but the complex viruses DNA also codes for proteins which help in building the viral capsid.
Many phage viruses are complex-shaped; they have an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail.
The tail may have a base plate with protein tail fibers.
Some complex viruses do not have tail fibers.
This “moon lander”-shaped complex virus infects Escherichia coli bacteria.
Some viruses are able to surround (envelop) themselves in a portion of the cell membrane of their host.
The virus can use either the outer membrane of the host cell, or an internal membrane such as the nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum.
In this way the virus gains an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope .
