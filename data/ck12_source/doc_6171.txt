Step 2:
Solve.
42.23 \text{ g } NH_4Cl \times \frac{1 \text{ mol } NH_4Cl}{53.50 \text{ g } NH_4Cl} &= 0.7893 \text{ mol } NH_4Cl\\\frac{0.7893 \text{ mol } NH_4Cl}{0.5000 \text{ L}} &= 1.579 \text{ M}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
The molarity is 1.579 M, meaning that a liter of the solution would contain 1.579 mol NH 4 Cl.
Four significant figures are appropriate.
In a laboratory situation, a chemist must frequently prepare a given volume of solutions of a known molarity.
The task is to calculate the mass of the solute that is necessary.
The molarity equation can be rearranged to solve for moles, which can then be converted to grams.
See sample problem 16.3.
A chemist needs to prepare 3.00 L of a 0.250 M solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO 4 ).
What mass of KMnO 4 does she need to make the solution?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
molarity = 0.250 M
volume = 3.00 L
molar mass KMnO 4 = 158.04 g/mol
mass KMnO 4 = ? g
Moles of solute is calculated by multiplying molarity by liters.
