The ancestor of plants is green algae.
This picture shows a close up of algae on the beach.
There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a result, became different from algae:
In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization.
Algae do not keep the embryo inside of themselves but release it into water.
This was the first feature to evolve that separated plants from green algae.
This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants.
Over time, plants had to evolve from living in water to living on land.
In early plants, a waxy layer called a cuticle evolved to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss.
However, the cuticle also prevents gases from entering and leaving the plant easily.
Recall that the exchange of gasses—taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen—occurs during photosynthesis.
To allow the plant to retain water and exchange gases, small pores (holes) in the leaves called stomata also evolved ( Figure below ).
The stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions.
When it's hot and dry, the stomata close to keep water inside of the plant.
When the weather cools down, the stomata can open again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out.
A later adaption for life on land was the evolution of vascular tissue.
Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants.
In algae, vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the water, and the water simply enters the algae.
But on land, water may only be found deep in the ground.
Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant.
