Enzymes are like wrenches.
They make it much easier and quicker for chemical reactions to take place.
Like a wrench, enzymes can also be used over and over again.
But you need the appropriate size and shape of the wrench to efficiently tighten the bolt, just like each enzyme is specific for the reaction it helps.
Digestive enzymes are released, or secreted, by the organs of the digestive system.
These enzymes include proteases that digest proteins, and nucleases that digest nucleic acids.
Examples of digestive enzymes are:
Amylase, produced in the mouth.
It helps break down large starch molecules into smaller sugar molecules.
Pepsin, produced in the stomach.
Pepsin helps break down proteins into amino acids.
Trypsin, produced in the pancreas.
Trypsin also breaks down proteins.
Pancreatic lipase, produced in the pancreas.
It is used to break apart fats.
Deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease, produced in the pancreas.
They are enzymes that break bonds in nucleic acids like DNA and RNA.
Bile salts are bile acids that help to break down fat.
Bile acids are made in the liver.
When you eat a meal, bile is secreted into the intestine, where it breaks down the fats ( Figure below ).
