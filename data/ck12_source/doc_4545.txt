Why?
Normally blood needs to flow freely through our arteries.
Plaque in an artery can restrict the flow of blood.
As you can probably imagine, this is not an ideal situation.
And eating right, exercising, and not smoking can help keep your arteries healthy.
Diseases of the heart and blood vessels, called cardiovascular diseases (CVD) , are very common.
The leading cause of CVD is atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque inside arteries (see Figure below ).
Plaque consists of cell debris, cholesterol, and other substances.
Factors that contribute to plaque buildup include a high-fat diet and smoking.
As plaque builds up, it narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow.

Cross section of plaque development
The fatty material inside the artery on the right is plaque.
Notice how much narrower the artery has become.
Less blood can flow through it than the normal artery.
Atherosclerosis normally begins in late childhood and is typically found in most major arteries.
It does not usually have any early symptoms.
Causes of atherosclerosis include a high-fat diet, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and diabetes.
Atherosclerosis becomes a threat to health when the plaque buildup prevents blood circulation in the heart or the brain.
