The sequence of amino acids in chains and the number of chains in a protein determine the protein’s shape.
The shape of a protein, in turn, determines its function.
Shapes may be very complex.

Q:
What do you think the “ribbons” in the colorful hemoglobin molecule pictured in the opening image represent?
A:
The “ribbons” represent chains of amino acids.
Proteins are the most numerous and diverse biochemical compounds, and they have many different functions.
Some of their functions include:
making up tissues as components of muscle.
speeding up biochemical reactions as enzymes.
regulating life processes as hormones.
helping to defend against infections as antibodies.
carrying materials around the body as transport proteins (see the example of hemoglobin in the Figure below ).
Hemoglobin transports oxygen around the body
The blood protein hemoglobin binds with oxygen and carries it from the lungs to all the body’s cells.
Heme is a small molecule containing iron that is part of the larger hemoglobin molecule.
Oxygen binds to the iron in heme.
