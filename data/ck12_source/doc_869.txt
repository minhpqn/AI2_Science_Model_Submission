Most air pollutants can be traced to the burning of fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels are burned during many processes, including in power plants to create electricity, in factories to make machinery run, in power stoves and furnaces for heating, and in waste facilities.
Perhaps one of the biggest uses of fossil fuels is in transportation.
Fossil fuels are used in cars, trains, and planes.
Air pollution can also be caused by agriculture, such as cattle ranching and the use of fertilizers and pesticides.
Other sources of air pollution include the production of plastics, refrigerants, and aerosols, in nuclear power and defense, from landfills and mining, and from biological warfare.
One result of air pollution is acid rain.
Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH.
This rain can be very destructive to wildlife.
When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life.
It causes this damage because of its very low pH.
Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ).
Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants.
Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.
This forest has been severely damaged by acid rain
A forest in the Jizera Mountains of the Czech Republic shows effects caused by acid rain.
What do you observe?
Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to global warming.
Global warming is an increase in the Earthâ€™s temperature.
It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.
