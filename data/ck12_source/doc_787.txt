What happens to the wire when the current begins to flow?
What difference would it make if the magnetic field were stronger?
What difference would it make if the battery were 3.0 V instead of 1.5 V?
Find the force on a 115 m long wire at right angles to a 5.0 \times 10^{-5} \ N/A \cdot m magnetic field, if the current through the wire is 400.
A.
Find the force on an electron passing through a 0.50 T magnetic field if the velocity of the electron is 4.0 \times 10^6 \ m/s .
A stream of doubly ionized particles  (\text{charge}= 2+) moves at a velocity of  3.0 \times 10^4 \ m/s perpendicularly to a magnetic field of 0.0900 T.
What is the magnitude of the force on the particles?
A wire 0.50 m long carrying a current of 8.0 A is at right angles to a 1.0 T magnetic field.
What force acts on the wire?
Suppose a magnetic field exists with the north pole at the top of the computer monitor and the south pole at the bottom of the monitor screen.
If a positively charged particle entered the field moving from your face to the other side of the monitor screen, which way would the path of the particle bend?
none of these
Suppose the surface of your dining room table is a magnetic field with the north pole at the north edge and the south pole at the south edge.
If an electron passes through this field from ceiling to floor, which way will the path of the electron bend?
toward the ceiling
