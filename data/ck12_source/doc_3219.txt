That’s how the ship pictured in the Figure below is using it.
A sonar device is both a sender and a receiver.
It sends out ultrasound waves and detects the waves after they reflect from underwater objects.
If you watch the video at the URL below, you can see how sonar is used on a submarine.

Sonar is used to locate underwater objects
The distance to underwater objects can be calculated from the known speed of sound in water and the time it takes for the sound waves to travel to the object.
The equation for distance traveled when speed and time are known is:
Distance = Speed × Time
Consider the ship and submarine pictured in the Figure above .
If an ultrasound wave travels from the ship to the submarine and back again in 2 seconds, what is the distance from the ship to the submarine?
The sound wave travels from the ship to the submarine in just 1 second, or half the time it takes to make the round trip.
The speed of sound waves through ocean water is 1437 m/s.
Therefore, the distance from the ship to the submarine is:
Distance = 1437 m/s × 1 s = 1437 m
Q:
Now assume that the sonar device on the ship sends an ultrasound wave to the bottom of the water.
If the sound wave is reflected back to the device in 4 seconds, how deep is the water?
A:
The time it takes the wave to reach the bottom is 2 seconds.
