Intermediate component of the cytoskeleton; made of protein fiber coils twisted into each other.
microfilaments :
Smallest component of the cytoskeleton; made of two actin chains twisted around one another.
microtubules :
Largest component of the cytoskeleton; hollow protein cylinders made of alpha and beta tubulin; also found in flagella.
microvilli :
Cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area of cells.
tubulin :
Protein component of microtubules; alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin combine to form components of microtubules.
The cytoplasm consists of everything between the plasma membrane of the cell and the nucleus (of an eukaryotic cell).
The cytoskeleton is a cellular "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm.
Three main cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments.
Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures and are most commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin.
Microfilament are the thinnest of the cytoskeleton structures and are made of two thin actin chains that are twisted around one another.
