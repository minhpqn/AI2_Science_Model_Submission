A river flowing over a floodplain may wear away broad curves.
These curves are called meanders .
Pictured below is an example of this ( Figure below ).

River Basins and Divides
All of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or watershed .
One river system’s basin is separated from another river system’s basin by a divide .
The divide is created by the highest points between the two river basins.
Precipitation that falls within a river basin always flows toward that river.
Precipitation that falls on the other side of the divide flows toward a different river.
A continental divide separates rivers that flow into different oceans.
Pictured below are the major river basins in the U.S. ( Figure below

A moving body of water of any size is a stream.
A river is a large stream.
A tributary begins at its headwaters on one side of a divide.
Two tributaries come together at a confluence.
A river ends at an estuary.
