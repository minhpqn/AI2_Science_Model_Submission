These tailor-made drugs promise not only to maximize the beneficial effects of the medicine, but also to decrease damage to nearby healthy cells.
More accurate methods of determining appropriate drug dosages.
Knowing a patientâ€™s genetics will enable doctors to determine how well his or her body can process and metabolize a medicine.
This will allow doctors to prescribe the proper levels of the medicine, allowing the medicine to have optimal results.
Improvements in the drug discovery and approval process.
Once the genes and proteins associated with a disease are known, the discovery of new medicines will be made easier using these genes and proteins as targets for the medicine.
In addition to creating much more beneficial medicines, this could significantly shorten the drug discovery process.
Better vaccines.
Safer vaccines can be designed and produced by organisms transformed with DNA sequences from an antigen.
These vaccines will trigger the immune response without the risks of infection.
They will be capable of being engineered to carry several strains of pathogen at once, combining several vaccines into one.
Cytochrome P450 Genes
There are several known genes which are largely responsible for variances in drug metabolism and response among humans.
The most common are the cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, which encode enzymes that influence the metabolism of more than 75% of current prescription drugs.
CYP450 proteins are hemoproteins, belonging to the superfamily of proteins containing a heme cofactor.
Often, these proteins form part of multi-component electron transfer chains, called P450-containing systems.
The letter in P450 represents the word pigment, as these enzymes are red because of their heme group.
The number 450 reflects the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme.
Humans have 57 genes (and more than 59 pseudogenes) divided among 18 families of cytochrome P450 genes and 43 subfamilies.
Some examples are shown in the Table below .
