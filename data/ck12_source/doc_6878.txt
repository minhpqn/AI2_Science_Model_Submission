Importance of Insects
Many insects are considered to be pests by humans.
However, insects are also very important for numerous reasons.
Insects can be found in every environment on Earth.
While a select few insects, such as the Arctic Wooly Bear Moth, live in the harsh Arctic climate, the majority of insects are found in the warm and moist tropics.
Insects have adapted to a broad range of habitats, successfully finding their own niche, because they will eat almost any substance that has nutritional value.
Insects are crucial components of many ecosystems, where they perform many important functions.
They aerate the soil, pollinate blossoms, and control insect and plant pests.
Many insects, especially beetles, are scavengers, feeding on dead animals and fallen trees, thereby recycling nutrients back into the soil.
As decomposers , insects help create top soil, the nutrient-rich layer of soil that helps plants grow.
Burrowing bugs, such as ants and beetles, dig tunnels that provide channels for water, benefiting plants.
Bees, wasps, butterflies, and ants pollinate flowering plants ( Figure below ).
Gardeners love the big-eyed bug and praying mantis because they control the size of certain insect populations, such as aphids and caterpillars, which feed on new plant growth.
Finally, all insects fertilize the soil with the nutrients from their droppings.
