This occurs only with first some first-class levers.
Advantage of Third Class Levers
You may be wondering why you would use a third-class lever when it doesnâ€™t change the direction or strength of the applied force.
The advantage of a third-class lever is that the output force is applied over a greater distance than the input force.
The output end of the lever must move faster than the input end in order to cover the greater distance.
Q :
A broom is a third-class lever when it is used to sweep a floor (see the Figure below ), so the output end of the lever moves faster than the input end.
Why is this useful?
A :
By moving more quickly over the floor, the broom does the work faster.
Brooms are examples of third class levers
A lever is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around a fixed point called the fulcrum.
Based on the location of the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum, there are three basic types of levers: first-class, second-class, and third-class levers.
The classes differ in their mechanical advantage and whether they change the direction of the input force.

What is a lever?
In the broom pictured in the Figure above , where is the fulcrum and where are the input and output forces applied?
If you use a screwdriver to pry the lid off a paint can, which class of lever is the screwdriver?
How does the screwdriver change the force that is applied to it?
