To figure this out, I need to know how much the shell of a walnut weighs (about 40% of the total weight of the unshelled walnut).
I can then calculate the mass of walnuts that will give me 250 grams of shelled walnuts and then determine how many walnuts I need to buy.
Mass to Mass Problems
Mass-mass calculations are the most practical of all mass-based stoichiometry problems.
Moles cannot be measured directly, while the mass of any substance can generally be easily measured in the lab.
This type of problem is three steps and is a combination of the two previous types.
\text{mass of} \ given \rightarrow \text{moles of} \ given \rightarrow \text{moles of} \ unknown \rightarrow \text{mass of} \ unknown
The mass of the given substance is converted into moles by use of the molar mass of that substance from the periodic table.
Then, the moles of the given substance are converted into moles of the unknown by using the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation.
Finally, the moles of the unknown are converted to mass by use of its molar mass.
Sample Problem:
Mass-Mass Stoichiometry
Ammonium nitrate decomposes to dinitrogen monoxide and water according to the following equation.
\text{NH}_4\text{NO}_3 (s) \rightarrow \text{N}_2 \text{O}(g)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
In a certain experiment, 45.7 g of ammonium nitrate is decomposed.
Find the mass of each of the products formed.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given: 45.7 g NH 4 NO 3
1 mol NH 4 NO 3 = 1 mol N 2 O = 2 mol H 2 O (mole ratios)
