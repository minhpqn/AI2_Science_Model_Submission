Hardness helps determine how an element (especially a metal) might be used.
Many elements are fairly soft (silver and gold, for example) while others (such as titanium, tungsten, and chromium) are much harder.
Carbon is an interesting example of hardness.
In graphite (the “lead” found in pencils) the carbon is very soft, while the carbon in a diamond is roughly seven times as hard.

Melting and boiling points are somewhat unique identifiers, especially of compounds.
In addition to giving some idea as to the identity of the compound, important information can be obtained about the purity of the material.
Is that Really Gold?
Archimedes and Density
How do you determine the density of an irregularly shaped object?
Learn how Archimedes did this thousands of years ago with just a beaker, water, and some simple math.

A physical property is a characteristic of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing the identity of the substance.
Physical properties include color, density, hardness, and melting and boiling points.
