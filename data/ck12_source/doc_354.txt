When one muscle is contracted, the other muscle from the pair is always elongated.
For example, the biceps and triceps muscles work together to allow you to bend and straighten your elbow.
When you want to bend your elbow, your biceps muscle contracts ( Figure below ), and, at the same time, the triceps muscle relaxes.
The biceps is the flexor, and the triceps is the extensor of your elbow joint.
Other muscles that work together are the quadriceps and hamstrings used to bend and straighten the knee, and the pectorals and trapezius used to move the arms and shoulders forward and backward.
During daily routines we do not use muscles equally.
For example, we use our biceps more than our triceps due to lifting against gravity.
The biceps help contract the arm, while the triceps help extend the arm
The biceps and triceps act against one another to bend and straighten the elbow joint.
To bend the elbow, the biceps contracts and the triceps relaxes.
To straighten the elbow, the triceps contract and the biceps relax.
Smooth Muscles and Cardiac Muscles
Smooth muscles and cardiac muscles are not attached to bone.
Recall that these types of muscles are under involuntary control.
Smooth muscle is responsible for the contractility of hollow organs, such as blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder, or the uterus.
Like skeletal muscles, smooth muscle fibers do contract together, causing the muscle to shorten.
Smooth muscles have numerous functions, including the following.
The smooth muscle in the uterus helps a woman to push out her baby.
In the bladder, smooth muscle helps to push out urine.
Smooth muscles move food through the digestive tract.
