Automsomal Dominant Disorders
Huntington’s disease is an example of an autosomal dominant disorder .
This means that if the dominant allele is present, then the person will express the disease.
A child only has to inherit one dominant allele to have the disease.
The disease causes the brain’s cells to break down, leading to muscle spasms and personality changes.
Unlike most other genetic disorders, the symptoms usually do not become apparent until middle age.
You can use a simple Punnett square to predict the inheritance of a dominant autosomal disorder, like Huntington’s disease.
If one parent has Huntington’s disease, what is the chance of passing it on to the children?
If you draw the Punnett square, you will find that there is a 50 percent chance of the disorder being passed on to the children.
Autosomal recessive genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, are caused by recessive alleles of a single gene on an autosome.
Autosomal dominant genetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease, are caused by dominant alleles of a single gene on an autosome.
