Describe the characteristics of the great apes.
Summarize the genetic and behavioral similarities among the great apes.
List specialized human features.
What animals are humans' closest cousins?
Looking at our evolutionary tree, our closest relatives include the orangutans pictured here.
Notice the way this mother cradles her child; they look very human-like.
Orangutans are also highly intelligent.
Notice the detail in the hand.
In the wild, they can create and use tools.
Humans and Primates
The great apes are the members of the biological family Hominidae, which includes four living genera: chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans.
Among these four genera are just seven species, two of each except humans, which has only one species, Homo sapiens.
The Great Apes are large, tailless primates, ranging in size from the pygmy chimpanzee, at 66-88 pounds in weight, to the gorilla, at 300-400 pounds ( Figure below ).
In all species, the males are, on average, larger and stronger than the females.

The gorilla is the largest of the hominids, weighing up to 309-397 lbs.
Most living primate species are four-footed, but all are able to use their hands for gathering food or nesting materials.
In some cases, hands are used as tools, such as when gorillas use sticks to measure the depth of water ( Figure below ).
Chimpanzees sharpen sticks to use as spears in hunting; they also use sticks to gather food and to “fish” for termites.
