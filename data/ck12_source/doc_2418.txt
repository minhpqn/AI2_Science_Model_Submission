In fact, there are millions of different kinds of matter in the universe.
Yet all kinds of matter actually consist of relatively few pure substances.
A pure substance is called an element .
An element is a pure substance because it cannot be separated into any other substances.
Currently, 92 different elements are known to exist in nature, although additional elements have been formed in labs.
All matter consists of one or more of these elements.
Some elements are very common; others are relatively rare.
The most common element in the universe is hydrogen, which is part of Earth’s atmosphere and a component of water.
The most common element in Earth’s atmosphere is nitrogen, and the most common element in Earth’s crust is oxygen.

Each element has a unique set of properties that is different from the set of properties of any other element.

The element neon, on the other hand, is a gas that gives off a red glow when electricity flows through it.
The lighted sign in the Figure below contains neon.
