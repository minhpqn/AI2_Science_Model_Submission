The following 10 points summarize photosynthesis.
6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Light Energy â†’ C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2
Autotrophs store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they build themselves.
Most autotrophs make their "food" through photosynthesis using the energy of the sun.
Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle specific to plant cells.
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast.
Electron carrier molecules are arranged in electron transport chains that produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical energy.
The light reactions capture energy from sunlight, which they change to chemical energy that is stored in molecules of NADPH and ATP.
The light reactions also release oxygen gas as a waste product.
The reactions of the Calvin cycle add carbon (from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) to a simple five-carbon molecule called RuBP.
The Calvin cycle reactions use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP that were produced in the light reactions.
The final product of the Calvin cycle is glucose.
What is photosynthesis?
The process of using the energy in sunlight to make food (glucose).
But of course it is much more complex than that simple statement.
Photosynthesis is a multistep biochemical pathway that uses the energy in sunlight to fix carbon dioxide, transferring the energy into carbohydrates, and releasing oxygen in the process.
What is NADPH?
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, an energy carrier molecule produced in the light reactions of photosynthesis.
NADPH is the reduced form of the electron acceptor NADP + .
At the end of the light reactions, the energy from sunlight is transferred to NADP + , producing NADPH.
