Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size.
As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom.
Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense.
If an object the size of a penny had the same density as the nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons!

Holding It All Together
Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other.
This explains why negative electrons orbit the positive nucleus.
Particles with the same electric charge repel each other.
This means that the positive protons in the nucleus push apart from one another.
So why doesn’t the nucleus fly apart?
An even stronger force—called the strong nuclear force—holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.
