The slits are separated by 0.011 \;\mathrm{mm} .
A flat screen is located 1.5 \;\mathrm{m} behind the slits.
Find the angle made by rays traveling to the third maximum off the optic axis.
How far from the center of the screen is the third maximum located?
How would your answers change if the experiment was conducted underwater?
Again, in your laboratory, 540 \;\mathrm{nm} light falls on a pinhole 0.0038 \;\mathrm{mm} in diameter.
Diffraction maxima are observed on a screen 5.0 \;\mathrm{m} away.
Calculate the distance from the central maximum to the first interference maximum.
Qualitatively explain how your answer to (a) would change if you:
move the screen closer to the pinhole
increase the wavelength of light
reduce the diameter of the pinhole
Students are doing an experiment with a Helium-neon laser, which emits 632.5 \;\mathrm{nm} light.
They use a diffraction grating with 8000 lines/cm.
They place the laser 1 \;\mathrm{m} from a screen and the diffraction grating, initially, 95 \;\mathrm{cm} from the screen.
They observe the first and then the second order diffraction peaks.
Afterwards, they move the diffraction grating closer to the screen.
Fill in the Table ( below ) with the expected data based on your understanding of physics.
Hint: find the general solution through algebra before plugging in any numbers.
Plot a graph of the first order distance as a function of the distance between the grating and the screen.
