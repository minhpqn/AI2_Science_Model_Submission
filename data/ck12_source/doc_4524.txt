The diseases have no known cure, but medicines may help control their symptoms.
The immune system attacks and damages the central nervous system so neurons cannot function properly.

uncontrolled shaking, slowed movements, issues associated with speaking
Abnormal changes in the brain cause the gradual loss of most normal brain activity.

In April 2011, an international analysis of the genes of more than 50,000 people led to the discovery of five new genes that make Alzheimer's disease more likely in the elderly and provide clues about what might start the Alzheimer's disease process and fuel its progress in a person’s brain.
