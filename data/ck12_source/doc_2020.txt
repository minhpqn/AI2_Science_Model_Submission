They use sunlight and nutrients to make food by photosynthesis .
Small zooplankton consume phytoplankton.
Larger organisms eat the small zooplankton.
Larger predators eat these consumers.
In an unusual relationship, some enormous whales depend on plankton for their food.
They filter tremendous amounts of these tiny creatures out of the water.
Example of a marine food chain
Many marine food chains look like this example.
The bacteria that make food from chemicals are also primary producers.
These organisms do not do photosynthesis since there is no light at the vents.
They do something called chemosynthesis .
They break down chemicals to make food.
When marine organisms die, decomposers break them down.
This returns their nutrients to the water.
The nutrients can be used again to make food.
Decomposers in the oceans include bacteria and worms.
Many live on the ocean floor.
Do you know why?
Photosynthesis is the base of nearly all food chains on Earth.
This is true of marine food chains, too.
