Rubber is an electric insulator, but a half-inch layer on the bottom of a pair of shoes is insignificant when it comes to lightning.
The average lightning bolt has 100 million volts and can burn through any insulator, even the insulators on high-voltage power lines.
The Path of Least Resistance
Look at the electric wires in the Figure below .
They are made of copper and coated with plastic.
Copper is very good conductor, and plastic is a very good insulator.
When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance.
That’s why all the current passes through the copper wire and none flows through its plastic coating.
Closeup of copper wires
Electricity must travel through matter.
All matter offers some resistance to the flow of electrons in an electric current.
Some materials resist current more or less than others.
Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors.
Many metals are good electric conductors.
Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators.
Wood, rubber, and plastic are good electric insulators.
When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance.
At the following URL, do the simulation lab “Conductor or Insulator.” After you work through the lab, identify which rod insulates and explain how you can tell.
What is an electric conductor?
Give examples of good electric conductors.
