Wegener then asked an important question and set about to answer it.
Were the continents once joined and then they drifted apart?
Wegener collected a great deal of evidence to support his idea.
Wegenerâ€™s evidence included the fit of the continents, the distribution of ancient fossils, the placement of similar rocks and structures on the opposite sides of oceans, and indicators of ancient climate found in locations where those climates do not exist today.
