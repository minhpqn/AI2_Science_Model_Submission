What is the cathode?
Write the symbol for the barium cation.
Write the symbol for the cesium cation.
List three ways cations are useful.
cation:
Ions known as cations are because they are positively charged and migrate toward the negative electrode (cathode) in an electrical field.
monovalent:
Has a +1 charge.
divalent:
Has a +2 charge.
cathode:
Negative electrode.
Explain how anions are formed.
Describe anion nomenclature.
List uses for anions.
Iodine can be found in seaweed
What does the amount of salt in seaweed tell us?
Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation.  In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet.  One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt.  This simple step greatly enhanced health and development.
Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.
When a metal loses an electron, energy is needed to remove that electron.  The other part of this process involves the addition of the electron to another element.  The electron adds to the outer shell of the new element.  Just as the loss of the electron from the metal produces a full shell, when the electron or electrons are added to the new element, it also results in a full shell.
