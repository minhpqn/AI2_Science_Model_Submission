3\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq)+2\text{PO}^{3^-}_4(aq) \rightarrow \text{Cu}_3(\text{PO}_4)_2(s)
Step 3:
Think about your result
For a precipitation reaction, the net ionic equation always shows the two ions that come together to form the precipitate.
The equation is balanced by mass and charge.
Net ionic equations are described and an example of writing a net ionic equation is given.
Do the practice equations at the web site below:
What does the name "spectator ion" mean?
Is there a reaction if no precipitate or gas is formed in an ionic equation?
What do we need to balance in net ionic equations?
net ionic equation:
The chemical equation that shows only those elements, compounds, and ions that are directly involved in the chemical reaction.
spectator ion:
An ion that does not take part in the chemical reaction and is found in solution both before and after the reaction.
Predicting Precipitates Using Solubility Rules
Use solubility rules to predict when a product will precipitate.
Predicting if precipitation occurs is partly accomplished by examining a set of rules
Will it rain?
Predicting the weather is tricky business.
A thorough examination of a large amount of data is needed to make the daily forecast.
