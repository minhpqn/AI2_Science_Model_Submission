In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells have many other organelles, including ribosomes and mitochondria.
Ribosomes are present in all cells.
Ribosomes are small organelles and are the sites of protein synthesis (or assembly).
They are made of ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA, and are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.
Unlike other organelles, ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane.
Each ribosome has two parts, a large and a small subunit, as shown in Figure below .
The subunits are attached to one another.
Ribosomes can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm.
Some ribosomes are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (as shown in Figure below ), and others are attached to the nuclear envelope.
Subunits of a ribosome
The two subunits that make up a ribosome, small organelles that are intercellular protein factories.
Ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions, such as translation.
Translation is the process of ordering the amino acids in the assembly of a protein, and translation will be discussed more in another concept.
Briefly, the ribosomes interact with other RNA molecules to make chains of amino acids called polypeptide chains, due to the peptide bond that forms between individual amino acids.
Polypeptide chains are built from the genetic instructions held within a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule.
Polypeptide chains that are made on the rough ER (discussed below) are inserted directly into the ER and then are transported to their various cellular destinations.
Ribosomes on the rough ER usually produce proteins that are destined for the cell membrane.
Ribosomes are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.
Ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane.
The other organelles found in eukaryotic cells are surrounded by a membrane.
