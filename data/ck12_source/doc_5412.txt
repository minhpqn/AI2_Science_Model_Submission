Regulation of Gene Expression
Each of your cells has about 22,000 genes.
In fact, all of your cells have the same genes.
So do all of your cells make the same proteins?
Do all 22,000 genes get turned into proteins in every cell?
Of course not.
If they did, then all your cells would do the same thing.
And it would be a devastating waste of energy.
You have cells with different functions because you have cells with different proteins.
And your cells have different proteins because they “use” different genes.
The regulation of gene expression , or gene regulation , includes the mechanism to turn genes “on” and transcribe those gene into RNA.
Any aspect of a gene's expression may be regulated, from the onset of transcription to the post-translational modification of a protein.
In general terms, gene regulation may occur in the following stages of gene expression:
mRNA degradation, and/or
It is this regulation that determines when and how much of a protein to make, giving a cell its specific structure and function.
The process of gene expression is used by all living organisms, from the simplest prokaryote to the most complex eukaryote.
And each cell in these organisms regulates gene expression to produce only the necessary proteins.

Gene regulation gives the cell control over its structure and function.
