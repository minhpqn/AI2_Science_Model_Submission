This diagram represents the evolution of mammals.
Synapsids called pelycosaurs became the most common land vertebrates during the first half of the Permian Period.
A pelycosaur genus called Dimetrodon is shown in Figure below .
Dimetrodon had sprawling legs and walked like a lizard.
It also had a fairly small brain.
However, it had started to develop some of the traits of mammals.
For example, it had teeth of different types.

Pelycosaur Synapsid:
Dimetrodon .
Dimetrodon was a pelycosaur.
It lived about 275 million years ago.
Some pelycosaurs gave rise to a group of animals called therapsids .
The earliest therapsids lived about 260 million years ago.
At first, the therapsids looked a lot like Dimetrodon .
But after a while, they could easily be mistaken for mammals.
They evolved a number of mammalian traits, such as legs positioned under the body instead of along the sides.
Therapsids became the most common and diverse land vertebrates during the second half of the Permian Period.
The Permian Period ended about 250 million years ago with a mass extinction.
Most therapsids went extinct.
