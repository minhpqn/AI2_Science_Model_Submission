Lemurs belong to the prosimian group of primates. ( top right ) One of the New World monkeys, a squirrel monkey. ( bottom left ) Chimpanzees belong to the great apes, one of the groups of primates. ( bottom right ) Reconstruction of a Neanderthal man, belonging to an extinct subspecies of Homo sapiens .
This subspecies of humans lived in Europe and western and central Asia from about 100,000 â€“ 40,000 BCE.
Key features of primates include:
Five fingers, known as pentadactyl .
Several types of teeth.
Certain eye orbit characteristics, such as a postorbital bar , or a bone that runs around the eye socket.
An opposable thumb , a finger that allows a grip that can hold objects.
What's the difference between monkeys and apes?
The easiest way to distinguish monkeys from the other primates is to look for a tail.
Most monkey species have tails, but no apes or humans do.
Monkeys are much more like other mammals than apes and humans are.
In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger compared to the rest of the brain.
A larger cerebrum allows primates to develop higher levels of intelligence.
Primates have the ability to learn new behaviors.
They also engage in complex social interactions, such as fighting and play.
Old World species, such as apes and some monkeys ( Figure above and Figure below ), tend to have significant size differences between the sexes.
This is known as sexual dimorphism .
Males tend to be slightly more than twice as heavy as females.
This dimorphism may have evolved when one male had to defend many females.
