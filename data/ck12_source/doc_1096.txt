A light-year , 9.5 trillion kilometers (5.9 trillion miles), is the distance that light travels in one year.
That’s a long way!
Out in space, it’s actually a pretty short distance.
Proxima Centauri is the closest star to us after the Sun.
This near neighbor is 4.22 light-years away.
That means the light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.22 years to reach us.
Our galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, is about 100,000 light-years across.
So it takes light 100,000 years to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other!
It turns out that even 100,000 light-years is a short distance.
The most distant galaxies we have detected are more than 13 billion light-years away.
That’s over a hundred-billion-trillion kilometers!
Looking Back in Time
When we look at stars and galaxies, we are seeing over great distances.
More importantly, we are also seeing back in time.
When we see a distant galaxy, we are actually seeing how the galaxy used to look.
For example, the Whirlpool Galaxy is about 23 million light-years from Earth ( Figure below ).
When you see an image of the galaxy what are you seeing?
You are seeing the galaxy as it was 23 million years ago!
