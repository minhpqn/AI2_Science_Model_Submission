The peripheral nervous system is divided into two parts, the sensory division and the motor division.
How these divisions of the peripheral nervous system are related to the rest of the nervous system is shown below ( Figure below ).
Refer to the figure as you read more about the peripheral nervous system in the text that follows.
The sensory division of the peripheral nervous system interprets signals, while the motor division sends signals
The sensory division interprets messages from sense organs and internal organs, and the motor division sends messages to internal organs, glands, and muscles.
The Sensory Division
The sensory division carries messages from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system.
Human beings have several senses.
They include sight, hearing, balance, touch, taste, and smell.
We have special sense organs for each of these senses.
What is the sense organ for sight?
For hearing?
Sensory neurons in each sense organ receive stimuli, or messages from the environment that cause a response in the body.
For example, sensory neurons in the eyes send messages to the brain about light.
Sensory neurons in the skin send messages to the brain about touch.
Our sense organs recognize sensations, but they don’t tell us what we are sensing.
For example, when you breathe in chemicals given off by baking cookies, your nose does not tell you that you are smelling cookies.
That’s your brain’s job.
The sense organs send messages about sights, smells, and other stimuli to the brain ( Figure below ).
The brain then reads the messages and tells you what they mean.
