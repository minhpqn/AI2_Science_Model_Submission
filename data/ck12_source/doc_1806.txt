So soil is a very important resource.
Our precious soil needs to be carefully managed and cared for.
If we donâ€™t take care of the soil we have, we may not be able to use it in the future.
Characteristics of Soil
Soil is a complex mixture of different materials.
Some of them are inorganic .
Inorganic materials are made from non-living substances like pebbles and sand.
Soil also contains bits of organic materials from plants and animals.
In general, about half of the soil is made of pieces of rock and minerals.
The other half is organic materials.
In some soils, the organic portion is entirely missing.
This is true of desert sand.
At the other extreme, a soil may be completely organic.
Peat, found in a bog or swamp, is totally organic soil.
Organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile.
The organic portion provides the nutrients needed for strong plant growth.
The inorganic portion of soil is made of many different size particles.
These different size particles are present in different proportions.
The sizes and proportions of particles determines some of the properties of the soil.
Water can flow easily through a permeable soil.
