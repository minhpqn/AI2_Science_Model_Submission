Large buildings can be placed on rollers so that they move with the ground.
Buildings may be placed on layers of steel and rubber to absorb the shock of the waves.
Connections, such as where the walls meet the foundation, must be made strong.
In a multi-story building, the first story must be well supported.
The Transamerica Building in San Francisco, pictured below, rests on a 52-foot deep steel and concrete foundation.
Steel rods reinforce the building internally and X-shaped trusses support it externally.
In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the building shook for more than a minute and swayed more than 12 inches in each direction, but was not damaged.
The Transamerica Pyramid is more stable than a standard skyscraper
The Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco is more stable in an earthquake or in high winds than a rectangular skyscraper.
Older buildings can be made more earthquake safe by retrofitting .
Steel or wood can be used to reinforce a building's structure and its connections.
Elevated freeways and bridges can also be retrofitted so that they do not collapse ( Figure below ).
Bridge retrofitted to meet earthquake safety standards
This bridge in San Diego, California, was built in 1931.
It was retrofitted and reopened in 2010 to meet earthquake standards.
Preventing Fire Damage
Fires often cause more damage than the earthquake.
Fires start because seismic waves rupture gas and electrical lines.
Breaks in water mains make it difficult to fight the fires ( Figure below ).
The shapes of pipes can make a big difference.
