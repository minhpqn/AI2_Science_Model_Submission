If the fault dips at an angle, the fault is a dip-slip fault ( Figure below ).
Imagine you are standing on a road looking at the fault.
The hanging wall is the rock that overlies the fault.
The footwall is beneath the fault.
If you are walking along a fault, the hanging wall is above you.
The footwall is where your feet would be.
Miners often extract mineral resources along faults.
They used to hang their lanterns above their heads.
That is why these layers were called the hanging wall.
Diagram of a reverse and normal fault
Block A is the hanging wall and block B is the footwall.
The left diagram shows a reverse, or thrust, fault and the right diagram shows a normal fault.
In normal faults , the hanging wall drops down relative to the footwall.
Normal faults are caused by tension that pulls the crust apart.
This causes the hanging wall to slide down.
Normal faults can build huge mountain ranges in regions experiencing tension ( Figure below ).
The Sierra Nevada Mountain formed due to a normal fault
The Sierra Nevada Mountains in eastern California rose up along a normal fault.
An animation of a normal fault is seen here:
When compression squeezes the crust into a smaller space, the hanging wall pushes up relative to the footwall.
