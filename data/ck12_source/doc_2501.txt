Its name provides the clue that it has a total of 17 protons and neutrons.
Therefore, it must have 9 neutrons (8 + 9 = 17).
Particles in Neutrons
Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons.
Each neutron contains three quarks, as shown in the diagram below.
Two of the quarks are called down quarks (d) and the third quark is called an up quark (u).
Gluons (represented by wavy black lines in the diagram) are fundamental particles that are given off or absorbed by quarks.
They carry the strong nuclear force that holds together quarks in a neutron.
A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom.
It is found in the nucleus and is neutral in electric charge.
It has about the same mass and diameter as a proton.
Neutrons are found in all atoms except for most atoms of hydrogen.
All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons, but they may vary in their numbers of neutrons.
Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons.
Gluons carry the strong nuclear force that binds together the quarks in a neutron.
