Pressure, Force, and Area
Pressure is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area.
Therefore, pressure can be represented by this equation:
Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area.
The smaller the area to which force is applied, the greater the pressure is.
Think about pressing a pushpin, like the one in the Figure below , into a bulletin board.
You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin.
However, the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin.
This is a much smaller area, so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with your thumb.
As a result, the pin penetrates the bulletin board with ease.
Pushpins concentrate force in a small area
SI Unit for Pressure
In the above equation for pressure, force is expressed in Newtons (N) and area is expressed in square meters (m 2 ).
Therefore, pressure is expressed in N/m 2 , which is the SI unit for pressure.
This unit is also called the Pascal (Pa) .
It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal whose discoveries about pressure in fluids led to a law of the same name.
Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal (kPa), which equals 1000 Pascals.
For example, the correct air pressure inside a mountain bike tire is usually about 200 kPa.
Calculating Pressure or Force
When you know how much force is acting on a given area, you can calculate the pressure that is being applied to the area using the equation for pressure given above.
