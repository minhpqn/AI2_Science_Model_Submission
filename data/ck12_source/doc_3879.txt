Though carbon can be found in ocean water, rocks and sediment and other parts of the biosphere, the atmosphere may be the most recognizable reservoir of carbon.
Carbon occurs in various forms in different parts of the carbon cycle.
Some of the different forms in which carbon appears are described in Table below .
KEY:
C = Carbon, O = Oxygen, H = Hydrogen
Form of Carbon
H 2 CO 3
HCO 3 âˆ’
Examples:
C 6 H 12 O 6 (Glucose), CH 4 (Methane)
Biosphere Organic Sediments (Fossil Fuels)
Other Carbon Compounds
Examples:
CaCO 3 (Calcium Carbonate), CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 (Calcium Magnesium Carbonate)
Sedimentary Rock, Shells, Sedimentary Rock
Carbon in Carbon Dioxide
Carbon cycles quickly between organisms and the atmosphere.
In the atmosphere, carbon exists primarily as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).
Carbon dioxide cycles through the atmosphere by several different processes, including those listed below.
Living organisms release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration .
