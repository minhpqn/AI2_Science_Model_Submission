A:
Driving at a constant speed around a bend in a road is one example.
Use your imagination to think of others.
Examples of Acceleration
You can see several examples of acceleration in the pictures from the Figure below .
In each example, velocity is changing but in different ways.
For example, direction may be changing but not speed, or vice versa.
Figure out what is moving and how it’s moving in each of the photos.
Examples of acceleration
Q:
Describe how velocity is changing in each of the motions you identified from the Figure above .
A:
You should describe how both direction and speed are changing.
For example, the boy on the carousel is moving up and down and around in a circle, so his direction is constantly changing, but his speed changes only at the beginning and end of the ride.
The skydiver is falling straight down toward the ground so her direction isn’t changing, but her speed keeps increasing as she falls until she opens her parachute.
For a better understanding of the changing velocity of a skydiver, watch the animation at this URL:
If you are accelerating, you may be able to feel the change in velocity.
This is true whether the change is in speed, direction, or both.
You often feel acceleration when you ride in a car.
As the car speeds up, you feel as though you are being pressed against the seat.
