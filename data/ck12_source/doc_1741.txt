What are the principal factors in determining climate?
What factors determine a climate type?
How does a biome relate to a climate zone?
Why would a region have its own microclimate, different from the surrounding climate?
How are altitude and latitude similar for producing life zones?
Tropical Moist Climates
Describe the conditions found in tropical climates.
What kind of climate is this?
Whether a place is wet all year round or dry for some time really affects what can grow there.
In the tropics, places that are wet year round have lush vegetation.
Places that are dry some of the time are much less lush.
Tropical climates are found around the Equator.
As you'd expect, these climates have warm temperatures year round.
The warm air rises at the Equator.
As it rises, it cools, causing it to rain.
Tropical climates may be very wet, or wet and dry.
Tropical Wet Climate
Tropical wet climates occur at or very near the Equator.
They have high rainfall year round.
Tropical rainforests ( FIgure below ) grow in this type of climate.
