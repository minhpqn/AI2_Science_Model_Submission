DNA:
A large molecule in the cell nucleus responsible for protein synthesis.
messenger RNA (mRNA):
Sets the pattern for protein synthesis outside the nucleus.
Radioisotopes in Medical Diagnosis and Treatment
List radioisotopes that are used in medical diagnosis and/or treatment.
Structure of thyroxine, which helps regulate metabolism
Why am I moving so slowly?
The molecule pictured above is thyroxine, a compound produced by the thyroid gland.
This molecule regulates how the body uses energy.
In a condition known as hypothyroidism, the thyroid makes less thyroxine than normal.
A person with this disease feels tired all the time and often puts on weight.
Treatment with thyroid hormone supplements takes care of the problem.
Radioisotopes in Medical Diagnosis and Treatment
Radioisotopes are widely used to diagnose disease and as effective treatment tools.
For diagnosis, the isotope is administered and then located in the body using a scanner of some sort.
The decay product (often gamma emission) can be located and the intensity measured.
The amount of isotope taken up by the body can then give information as to the extent of the medical problem.
An isotope of iodine (I-131) is used in both the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer.
The thyroid will normally absorb iodine to produce the iodine-containing thyroid hormones.
