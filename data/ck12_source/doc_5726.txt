Beryllium has two valence electrons.
How many valence electrons does boron have?
You must recognize that the second principal energy level consists of both the 2 s and the 2 p sublevels and so the answer is three.
In fact, the number of valence electrons goes up by one for each step across a period until the last element is reached.
Neon, with its configuration ending in s 2 p 6 , has eight valence electrons.
Valence electrons are the outer-shell electrons of an atom.
Valence electrons determine the reactivity of an atom.

How many valence electrons are there in fluorine?
What are the 2 s electrons in nitrogen?
How many inner shell electrons are there in beryllium?
inner-shell electrons:
Those electrons that are not in the outer shell and are not involved in the reactivity of the element.
valence electrons:
The electrons in the highest occupied principal energy level of an atom.
