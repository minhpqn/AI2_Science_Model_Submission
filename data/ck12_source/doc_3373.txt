How is electric current measured in the simulation?
What happens when you stop moving the magnet?
What is electromagnetic induction?
When does it occur?
How could you increase the amount of current produced by electromagnetic induction?
Explain how a moving magnet and a coil of wire can be used to produce alternating current.
List two devices that use electromagnetic induction.
Describe an electric generator and its function.
Explain how generators transform kinetic energy to electrical energy.
The sprawling machines in this plant arenâ€™t factory machines, but they do produce something.
They are electric generators in a hydroelectric power plant, and they produce electricity.
An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field.
It occurs when a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another.
A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in the Figure below .
In any electric generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft.
The turning shaft causes a coil of wire to rotate between the opposite poles of a magnet.
Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire.
You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below.
Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works.
