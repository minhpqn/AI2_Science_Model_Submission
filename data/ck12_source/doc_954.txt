The purpose of the control rods is to absorb some of the neutrons and thus stop them from causing further disintegrations.
The control rods can be raised or lowered into the fuel rod bundle.
When the control rods are lowered all the way into the fuel rod bundle, they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction essentially stops.
When more heat is desired, the control rods are raised so that the chain reaction speeds up and more heat is generated.
The control rods are operated in a fail-safe system so that power is necessary to hold them up.
During a power failure, gravity will pull the control rods down to shut off the system.
It is possible, however, to convert U-238 to a fissionable isotope that will function as a fuel for nuclear reactors.
This process is carried out in reactors called breeder reactors.
None of the civilian nuclear power plants in the U.S. are breeder reactors.
