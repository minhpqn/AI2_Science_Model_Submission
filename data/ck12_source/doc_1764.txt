Describe the consequences of global warming.
What is the human cost of warmer temperatures?
Many lands are marginal for farming.
When rainfall is normal or high, the lands can produce.
When rainfall is low, no crops grow.
Drought makes marginal lands unsuitable for farming.
Drought can also make good lands more difficult to farm.
These changes will increase as temperatures warm.
Causes of Global Warming
The average global temperature has been rising since the end of the Pleistocene.
With some ups and downs, of course.
Rising temperatures are natural for this time period.
But natural causes cannot explain all the warming that's been happening.
There is some other factor at work.
Recent global warming is due mainly to human actions.
The actions involve releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Remember that greenhouse gases keep the atmosphere warm?
And that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas?
When you burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.
