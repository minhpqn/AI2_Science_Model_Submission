Some of this energy is converted to heat.
The rest of the energy is used to form many small molecules of a compound called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.
ATP molecules contain just the right amount of stored chemical energy to power biochemical reactions inside cells.
You can see these energy changes in cellular respiration in the video at this URL:  .

Cellular respiration is the process in which the cells of all living things break down glucose with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water.
Cellular respiration is a catabolic process that releases energy by breaking bonds in glucose.
It uses the energy to form ATP, a small molecule that stores just the right amount of energy for cells to use.
Watch the video about cellular respiration at the following URL, and then compare and contrast the two types of cellular respiration.

What is cellular respiration?
Represent cellular respiration with a chemical equation.
Explain why cellular respiration is a catabolic reaction.
What happens to the energy that is released when bonds are broken in glucose molecules?
Enzymes as Catalysts
Explain why chemical reactions in living cells require enzymes.
Describe how enzymes work.
Identify two human digestive enzymes.
An enzyme cleaner like the one pictured here contains proteins called enzymes.
The enzymes attach themselves to particular stains and help break them down.
