A 5.00\;\mathrm{kg} firecracker explodes into two parts: one part has a mass of 3.00 \;\mathrm{kg} and moves at a velocity of 25.0 \;\mathrm{m/s} towards the west.
The other part has a mass of 2.00 \;\mathrm{kg} .
What is the velocity of the second piece as a result of the explosion?
A firecracker lying on the ground explodes, breaking into two pieces.
One piece has twice the mass of the other.
What is the ratio of their speeds?
While driving in your pickup truck down Highway 280 between San Francisco and Palo Alto, an asteroid lands in your truck bed!
Despite its 220 \;\mathrm{kg} mass, the asteroid does not destroy your 1200\;\mathrm{kg} truck.
In fact, it landed perfectly vertically.
Before the asteroid hit, you were going 25 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
After it hit, how fast were you going?
An astronaut is 100\;\mathrm{m} away from her spaceship doing repairs with a 10.0 \;\mathrm{kg} wrench.
The astronautâ€™s total mass is 90.0 \;\mathrm{kg} and the ship has a mass of 1.00 \times10^4\;\mathrm{kg} .
If she throws the wrench in the opposite direction of the spaceship at 10.0 \;\mathrm{m/s} how long would it take for her to reach the ship?
