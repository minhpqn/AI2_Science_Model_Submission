Q:
How do you think electric current can be used to encode messages?
A:
The short answer is by changing the voltage in an electric circuit.

Electric devices, such as lights and household appliances, change electric current to other forms of energy.
For example, an electric stove changes electric current to thermal energy.
Other common devices, such as mobile phones and computers, use electric current for another purpose: to encode information.
A message encoded this way is called an electronic signal , and the use of electric current for this purpose is called electronics .

To encode a message with electric current, the voltage is changed rapidly, over and over again.
Voltage is a difference in electric potential energy that is needed in order for electric current to flow.
There are two different ways voltage can be changed, resulting in two different types of electronic signals, called analog signals and digital signals.
Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage in an electric circuit.
The Figure below represents analog signals.
These were the first electronic signals to be invented.
They were used in early computers and other early electronic devices.
Analog signals are subject to distortion and noise, so they arenâ€™t used as often anymore.
They are used mainly in microphones and some mobile phones to encode sounds as electronic signals.
