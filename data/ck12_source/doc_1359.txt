Hotspots may also be active at plate boundaries.
This is especially common at mid-ocean ridges.
Iceland is formed by a hotspot along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Hotspots within Continents
Hotspots are found within continents, but not as commonly as within oceans.
They are not common because it takes a massive mantle plume to penetrate the thick continental crust.
Eruptions from these hotspots are rare but massive.
The Yellowstone hotspot is a famous example of a continental hotspot.
Volcanoes grow above hotspots.
A hotspot is a zone of melting above a mantle plume.
Hotspot volcanoes are better able to penetrate oceanic crust than continental crust.
We see many more hotspot volcanoes in the oceans.
Shield volcanoes commonly form above hotspots in the oceans.
