Use Avogadro’s law to solve for the final volume.
Step 2:
Solve.
First, rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for V_2 .
V_2=\frac{V_1 \times n_2}{n_1}
Now substitute the known quantities into the equation and solve.
V_2=\frac{1.90 \text{ L} \times 0.1130 \text{ mol}}{0.0920 \text{ mol}}=2.33 \text{ L}
Step 3:
Think about your result.
Since a relatively small amount of additional helium was added to the balloon, its volume increases slightly.
Calculations are shown for relationships between volume and number of moles of a gas.
Work on the problems at the site below:
What is held constant in the Avogadro’s Law relationship?
What happens if you add gas to a rigid container?
Why does a balloon expand when you add air to it?
Avogadro’s law:
The volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas when the temperature and pressure are held constant.
Ideal Gas Law
Derive the ideal gas law from the combined gas law and Avogadro’s law.
Calculate the value of the ideal gas constant.
