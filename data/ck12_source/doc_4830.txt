Acids and bases.
Why are these important in biology?
It comes back to a number of biological and biochemical processes.
For example, some enzymes work best at specific pH levels of acids.
Other biochemical reactions need a relatively neutral environment to function properly.
Take your stomach, a very acidic environment.
The enzyme pepsin that works best in that acidic environment could not work in your mouth.
What would your food taste like if your mouth was also a very acidic environment?
Other biochemical reactions need a relatively neutral environment to function properly.
