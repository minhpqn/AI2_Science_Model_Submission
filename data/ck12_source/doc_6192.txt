Molecular and Ionic Equations
Define molecular and ionic equations.
Give examples of molecular and ionic equations.
The reaction of acid and calcium carbonate causes statues to become damaged by acid rain
“Just a little rain...”
One of the unfortunate by-products of our industrialized society is acid rain.
Sulfur dioxide from burning coal and nitric oxides from vehicle emissions both form acids.
When these acids react with limestone (calcium carbonate), reactions occur that dissolve the limestone and release water and carbon dioxide.
Over a period of time, serious damage is caused to the structures.
Molecular and Ionic Equations
When ionic compounds are dissolved into water, the polar water molecules break apart the solid crystal lattice, resulting in the hydrated ions being evenly distributed through the water.
This process is called dissociation and is the reason that all ionic compounds are strong electrolytes.
When two different ionic compounds that have been dissolved in water are mixed, a chemical reaction may occur between certain pairs of the hydrated ions.
Consider the double-replacement reaction that occurs when a solution of sodium chloride is mixed with a solution of silver nitrate.
\text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{AgNO}_3 (aq) \rightarrow \text{NaNO}_3 (aq)+\text{AgCl}(s)
The driving force behind this reaction is the formation of the silver chloride precipitate (see Figure below ).
Silver chloride precipitates when silver nitrate is added to sodium chloride
The white silver chloride precipitate instantly forms when a solution of silver nitrate is added to a solution of sodium chloride.
This is called a molecular equation.
A molecular equation is an equation in which the formulas of the compounds are written as though all substances exist as molecules.
