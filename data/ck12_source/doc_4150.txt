What are three important features of modern land plants?
What were the first plants to evolve?
What are vascular tissues of a plant?
What is their function?
Explain why life on land was difficult for early plants.
Why did plants need to become established on land before animals could colonize the land?
Evolution of Seed Plants
Outline major events in plant evolution.
Describe the importance of the seed.
Explain the relationship between ovules, pollen, pollen tubes, and pollination.
Distinguish between gymnosperms and angiosperms.
Why are they called sunflowers?
When the plant is in the bud stage, the flower tends to track the movement of the sun across the horizon, hence the name sunflower.
Flowering plants were the last group of plants to evolve.
The flower contains both the male and female reproductive structures, and these plants have become tremendously successful.
But these plants could not have evolved without the prior evolution of the seed.
