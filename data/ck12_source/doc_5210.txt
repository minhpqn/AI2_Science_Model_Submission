Mendel summarized his findings in two laws: the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment.
The Law of Segregation is based on his findings from his first set of experiments.
Mendel stated that heritable factors are segregated during gamete formation.
More precisely, this law states that a pair of alleles is separated, or segregated, during the formation of gametes.
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly separated.
Each resulting gamete has an equal probability or chance of receiving either of the two alleles.
In other words, each gamete has only one allele for each gene.

allele :
An alternative form or different version of a gene.
dominant :
The allele that is expressed when two separate alleles are inherited.
gene :
A segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a single polypeptide.
Law of Segregation :
Mendelâ€™s first law of inheritance; states that the two factors (alleles) controlling a characteristic separate during gamete formation.
recessive :
The allele that is expressed only in the absence of a dominant allele.
Mendel developed a theory that explained simple patterns of inheritance in which two alleles are inherited to result in one of several traits in offspring.
The law of segregation states that a pair of alleles is segregated during the formation of gametes and that each gamete has an equal chance of getting either one of the allele.
