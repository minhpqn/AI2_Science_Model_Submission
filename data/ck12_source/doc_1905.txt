Divisions in Earth history are recorded on the geologic time scale .
For example, the Cretaceous ended when the dinosaurs went extinct.
European geologists were the first to put together the geologic time scale.
So, many of the names of the time periods are from places in Europe.
The Jurassic Period is named for the Jura Mountains in France and Switzerland, for example.
Putting Events in Order
To create the geologic time scale, geologists correlated rock layers.
Steno's laws were used to determine the relative ages of rocks.
Older rocks are at the bottom, and younger rocks are at the top.
The early geologic time scale could only show the order of events.
The discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s changed that.
Scientists could determine the exact age of some rocks in years.
They assigned dates to the time scale divisions.
For example, the Jurassic began about 200 million years ago.
It lasted for about 55 million years.
Divisions of the Geologic Time Scale
The largest blocks of time on the geologic time scale are called “eons.” Eons are split into “eras.” Each era is divided into “periods.” Periods may be further divided into “epochs.” Geologists may just use “early” or “late.” An example is “late Jurassic,” or “early Cretaceous.” Pictured below is the geologic time scale ( Figure below ).

The geologic time scale divides Earth history into named units.
