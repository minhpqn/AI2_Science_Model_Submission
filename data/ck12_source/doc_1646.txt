In addition to cell division, the cell cycle includes the division of the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
Most cell division produces genetically identical cells, meaning they have the same DNA.
The process of mitosis, which specifically is the division of the nucleus, ensures that each cell has the same DNA.
During mitosis, the chromosomes equally separate, thus making sure each nucleus in each resulting cell after cell division is genetically identical.
A special form of cell division, called meiosis, produces cells with half as much DNA as the parent cell.
These cells are used for reproduction.
In prokaryotic organisms, cell division is how those organisms reproduce.
Drawing of mitosis in a zygote to form an embryo
Cells divide repeatedly to produce an embryo.
Previously the one-celled zygote (the first cell of a new organism) divided to make two cells (a).
Each of the two cells divides to yield four cells (b), then the four cells divide to make eight cells (c), and so on.
Through cell division, an entire embryo forms from one initial cell.
Besides the development of a baby, there are many other reasons that cell division is necessary for life:
To grow and develop, you must form new cells.
Imagine how often your cells must divide during a growth spurt.
Growing just an inch requires countless cell divisions.
Your body must produce new bone cells, new skin cells, new cells in your blood vessels and so on.
Cell division is also necessary to repair damaged cells.
Imagine you cut your finger.
After the scab forms, it will eventually disappear and new skin cells will grow to repair the wound.
