For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase.
If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem.
Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem.
In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.
Prey also have adaptations for avoiding predators.
Prey sometimes avoid detection by using camouflage ( Figure below ).
Camouflage means that species have an appearance (color, shape, or pattern) that helps them blend into the background.
Mimicry is a related adaptation in which a species uses appearance to copy or mimic another species.
For example, a non-poisonous dart frog may evolve to look like a poisonous dart frog.
Why do you think this is an adaptation for the non-poisonous dart frog?
Mimicry can be used by both predators and prey ( Figure below ).
Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship and will be described in the Symbiosis concept.
This dead leaf mantis is camouflaged by the actual dead leaves
Camouflage by the dead leaf mantis makes it less visible to both its predators and prey.
If alarmed, it lies motionless on the rainforest floor of Madagascar, Africa, camouflaged among the actual dead leaves.
It eats other animals up to the size of small lizards.
The Viceroy butterfly mimics the unpleasant Monarch butterfly
An example of mimicry, where the Viceroy butterfly ( right ) mimics the unpleasant Monarch butterfly ( left ).
Both butterfly species are avoided by predators to a greater degree than either one would be without mimicry.
Predation happens when a predator organism feeds on another living organism or organisms, known as prey.
