A flowchart showing bacterial conjugation
A flowchart showing bacterial conjugation.
The donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus, or sex pilus.
The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell.
The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid, moves into the recipient cell.
Prokaryotic cells grow to a certain size.
Then they divide by binary fission.
This is a type of asexual reproduction.
Binary fission produces genetically identical offspring.
Genetic transfer increases genetic variation in prokaryotes.
