List five.
Viruses in Research and Medicine
Identify how viruses are used in research and medicine.
Distinguish between a viral vector and a phage.
Distinguish between viral therapy and gene therapy.
Can viruses be helpful, or just harmful?
Viruses are extensively used in research and medicine to both understand basic biology and to improve human health.
Imagine having a tool that is able to inject its DNA into a host cell.
The possibilities of using such a tool are endless.
That tool would be a virus.
Viruses in Research
Viruses are an extremely important tool in the study of molecular and cellular biology.
Since viruses infect cells by moving their genetic material into the host cell's nucleus, they are helpful in the investigation of the functions of cells.
For example, the use of viruses in research has helped our understanding of the basics of molecular genetics, such as DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein transport, and immunology.
Viruses and Medicine
Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying.
A viral vector is a tool commonly used by molecular biologists to place genetic material into cells.
To be a useful viral vector, the virus is modified so that it will not cause disease, and it will infect only certain types of cells.
Phages are often used as vectors to genetically modify bacteria.
In a similar fashion, viral therapy uses viruses to genetically modify diseased cells and tissues.
