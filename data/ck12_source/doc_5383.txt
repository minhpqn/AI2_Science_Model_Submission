Do you know of other examples of each type of mutagen shown here?
a base is changed by the repositioning of a hydrogen atom
loss of a purine base (A or G)
spontaneous deamination of 5-methycytosine
a purine to purine, or a pyrimidine to pyrimidine change
a purine becomes a pyrimidine, or vice versa
induced mutation :
A mutation caused by an environmental factor.
mutagen :
An environmental factor which causes a mutation; includes certain chemicals and radiation.
mutagenesis :
The process of creating stable mutations.
spontaneous mutation :
A mutation that occurs without induction, possibly due to a mistake during DNA replication or transcription.
Mutagenesis is a process by mutations, stable changes in the genetic material, are created.
Mutations may be due to environmental factors (mutagens) or may occur spontaneously.
Mutations may have no effect, may be beneficial, or may be harmful.
Typical mutagens include chemicals, such as those inhaled by smoking, and radiation, like X-rays, ultraviolet light, and nuclear radiation.
Define mutagenesis and mutagen.
List three examples of mutagens.
