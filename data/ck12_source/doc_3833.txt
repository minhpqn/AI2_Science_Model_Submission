Compare and contrast allopatric and sympatric speciation.
How can a river influence evolution?
Imagine a group of small organisms, such as mice, that become separated by a mighty river.
This group has now become isolated, and formed two separate groups.
The groups are obviously no longer able to breed together.
Over many generations, each group will evolve separately, eventually forming two completely new species of mice.
Origin of Species
Macroevolution is evolution over geologic time above the level of the species.
One of the main topics in macroevolution is how new species arise.
The process by which a new species evolves is called speciation .
How does speciation occur?
How does one species evolve into two or more new species?
To understand how a new species forms, itâ€™s important to review what a species is.
A species is a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring together in nature.
For a new species to arise, some members of a species must become reproductively isolated from the rest of the species.
This means they can no longer interbreed with other members of the species.
How does this happen?
Usually they become geographically isolated first.
Assume that some members of a species become geographically separated from the rest of the species.
If they remain separated long enough, they may evolve genetic differences.
