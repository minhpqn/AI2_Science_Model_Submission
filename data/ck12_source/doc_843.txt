Algae, which is the green layer you might see floating on a pond, are an example of phytoplankton.
There are also bacteria that use chemical processes to produce food.
They get their energy from sources other than the sun, but they are still called producers.
This process is known as chemosynthesis , and is common in ecosystems without sunlight, such as certain marine ecosystems.
Producers include plants, algae, and diatoms
Producers include (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) diatoms.
With just a few exceptions, all life on Earth depends on the sunâ€™s energy for survival.
Producers make food for the rest of the ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis, where the energy of the sun is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.
