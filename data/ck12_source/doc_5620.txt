B. 0.000416 has three significant figures.
Zeros that appear after all nonzero digits are called right-end zeros.  Right-end zeros in a number that lacks a decimal point are not significant.
A. 140 has two significant figures.
B. 75,210 has four significant figures.
Right-end zeros in a number with a decimal point are significant.
This is true whether the zeros occur before or after the decimal point.
A. 620.0 has four significant figures.
B. 19.000 has five significant figures
It needs to be emphasized that to say a certain digit is not significant does not mean that it is not important or can be left out.
Though the zero in a measurement of 140 may not be significant, the value cannot simply be reported as 14.
An insignificant zero functions as a placeholder for the decimal point.
When numbers are written in scientific notation, this becomes more apparent.
The measurement 140 can be written as 1.4 × 10 2 with two significant figures in the coefficient.
For a number with left-end zeros, such as 0.000416, it can be written as 4.16 × 10 −4 with 3 significant figures.
In some cases, scientific notation is the only way to correctly indicate the correct number of significant figures.
In order to report a value of 15,000,000 with four significant figures, it would need to be written as 1.500 × 10 7 .
The right-end zeros after the 5 are significant.
The original number of 15,000,000 only has two significant figures.
Significant figures give an indication of the certainty of a measurement.
Rules allow decisions to be made about how many digits to use in any given situation.
