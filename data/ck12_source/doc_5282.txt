There are three other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and SADDAN Dysplasia (severe achondroplasia, developmental delay, acanthuses nigricans, a skin condition).
Each of these disorders is also caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene.
Each of the conditions results in a distinct difference in the degree of severity of the phenotype, with hypochondroplasia having the mildest phenotype and thanatophoric dysplasia being a lethal condition.
Other genes in which mutations cause a phenotypic spectrum of disease include the type I and type II collagen genes, among others.
Mutations in the type I collagen genes result in bone disorders, specifically the spectrum of osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease.
Mutations in the type II collagen disease result in disorders of cartilage, including Achondrogenesis type II, hypochondrogenesis, Kniest Dysplasia, the SEDs (spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia) and Stickler Syndrome.

Treating Genetic Disorders
The symptoms of genetic disorders can sometimes be treated, but cures for genetic disorders are still in the early stages of development.
One potential cure that has already been used with some success is gene therapy .
This involves inserting normal genes into cells with mutant genes.
At the following link, you can watch the video Sickle Cell Anemia:
Hope from Gene Therapy, to learn how scientists are trying to cure sickle-cell anemia with gene therapy.
If you could learn your risk of getting cancer or another genetic disease, would you?
Though this is a personal decision, it is a possibility.
A San Francisco company now makes it easy to order medical genetic tests through the Web.
