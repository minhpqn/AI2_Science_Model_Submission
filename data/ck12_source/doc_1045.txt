Scientific proposals are evaluated by other scientists in that field of science.
In many fields, the funding rate is low.
The money goes only to the most worthy research projects.
Once the scientists get the money, they can do their research.
Scientists may work in colleges and universities.
They may work in research institutions or government agencies.
Businesses and industries hire scientists in a variety of fields.
There are many opportunities for well-trained scientists.
Scientists may work together on a project.
One reason is that they can share equipment and personnel.
Another reason is that they can share ideas.
Scientists may also work separately.
Even then, they use each other's data and interpretations.
When one scientist publishes a paper, others will replicate the work to make sure they get the same result.
If they do, the work is valid.
If they don't, someone needs to find the source of the problem.
Scientists openly communicate with each other on their results.
They also discuss and sometimes disagree on their interpretations.
If scientists do disagree, they will look for evidence so that they may resolve the disagreement.
A hypothesis will not be fully accepted unless it is supported by the work of many scientists.
