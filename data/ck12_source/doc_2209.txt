Neptune has slightly more mass than Uranus, but it is slightly smaller in size.
Extremes of Cold and Wind
Like Uranus, Neptune is blue.
The blue color is caused by gases in its atmosphere, including methane.
Neptune is not a smooth looking ball like Uranus.
The planet has a few darker and lighter spots.
When Voyager 2 visited Neptune in 1986, there was a large dark-blue spot south of the equator.
This spot was called the Great Dark Spot.
When the Hubble Space Telescope photographed Neptune in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared.
Another dark spot had appeared north of the equator.
Astronomers believe that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on Neptune.
Neptune's appearance changes due to its turbulent atmosphere.
Winds are stronger than on any other planet in the solar system.
Wind speeds can reach 1,100 km/h (700 mph).
This is close to the speed of sound!
The rapid winds surprised astronomers.
This is because Neptune receives little energy from the Sun to power weather systems.
It is not surprising that Neptune is one of the coldest places in the solar system.
Temperatures at the top of the clouds are about –218°C (–360°F).
