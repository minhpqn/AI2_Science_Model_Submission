The base pairing in RNA is unique to each molecule of RNA and results in a three-dimensional structure that gives each molecule functional properties.
Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices but rather collections of short helices combined into a functional molecule.
Because of the structure of RNA, the RNA molecule can achieve biochemical catalysis, similar to that of enzymes.
For instance, the structure of the ribosome allows peptide bond formation during protein synthesis.
The active site of the ribosome is composed entirely of RNA.
nucleotide :
Monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar, and a phosphate group.
protein synthesis :
The process in which cells make proteins; includes transcription of DNA and translation of mRNA.
ribose : 5-carbon sugar of an RNA nucleotide.
uracil :
Nitrogenous base specific for RNA; replaces the base thymine in DNA.
RNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid.
RNA contains the nitrogenous base uracil.
RNA can fold into three-dimensional structures with functional properties.
