We take advantage of the freezing point depression of salt in water by putting salt on ice to melt it.
That’s why the truck in the Figure below is spreading salt on an icy road.

Did you ever see anyone add a fluid to their car radiator?
The fluid might be antifreeze, like in the Figure below .
Antifreeze lowers the temperature of the water in the car radiator so it won’t freeze, even when the temperature falls far below 0 °C.
For example, a 50 percent antifreeze solution won’t freeze unless the temperature goes below -37 °C.
Antifreeze lowers the freezing temperature of the water in car radiators
Boiling Point Elevation
Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator.
Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water.
If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged.
However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher.
For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C.
Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine.
When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent.
A solute generally lowers the freezing point of a solvent, which is called freezing point depression.
For example, spreading salt on an icy road melts the ice.
A solute generally raises the boiling point of a solvent, which is called boiling point elevation.
For example, adding antifreeze to the water in a car radiator prevents the water from boiling.
