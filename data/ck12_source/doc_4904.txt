cristae :
Inner membrane folds of the mitochondrion.
Heteroplasmy : the presence of a mixture of more than one type of mtDNA (normal or defected).
Krebs cycle :
Stage 2 of aerobic cellular respiration; a series of chemical reactions which completes the breakdown of glucose begun in stage 1, releasing more chemical energy and producing carbon dioxide; also called the Citric Acid Cycle.
matrix :
Fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrion; space inside of the inner membrane.
mitochondria (singular, mitochondrion ):
Membrane-enclosed organelles that are found in most eukaryotic cells; called the "power plants" of the cell because they use energy from organic compounds to make ATP.
porin :
Integral membrane proteins that act as a pore through which molecules can diffuse.
Theory of Endosymbiosis :
Theory that proposes that eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria, evolved from ancient, free-living prokaryotes that invaded other prokaryotic cells.
Mitochondria are where energy from organic compounds is used to make ATP.
Mitochondria have a double-membrane, resulting in five distinct compartments within the mitochondrion.
They are:
The outer mitochondrial membrane.
The intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes).
The inner mitochondrial membrane.
The cristae space (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane).
