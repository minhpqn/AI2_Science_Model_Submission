The fish move very little and breathe slowly.
Missing a meal could be deadly, so the fish have interesting ways of getting and keeping food.
Some species have jaws that unhinge to accept a larger fish.
Some have backward-folding teeth to keep prey from escaping.

Many ocean-related videos are found in National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Habitat, Ocean section: .
Just a few are listed below.
“Deep-Sea Robo Help” covers how we can know what lives in the ocean.
Some of the results of the Census of Marine Life have been released and are discussed in “Record-Breaking Sea-Creature Surveys Released.”
Bioluminescence is common in the oceans and seen in “Why Deep Sea Creatures Glow.”
Hydrothermal vents are among the most unusual ecosystems on Earth.
They are located at mid-ocean ridges where water is extremely hot.
The food source for these ecosystems is chemosynthesis ( Figure below ).
This ecosystem is entirely separate from the photosynthesis at the surface.
Shrimp, clams, fish, and giant tube worms have been found in these extreme places.
Tube worms, which live at hydrothermal vents
Giant tube worms are found at hydrothermal vents.
They get food from the chemosynthetic bacteria that live within them.
The bacteria provide food; the worms provide shelter.
