Substitute the values for the rectangle’s length and width into the formula for area:
Area = 9 cm × 5 cm = 45 cm 2
Q:
Can you use this formula to find the area of a square surface?
A:
Yes, you can.
A square has four sides that are all the same length, so you would substitute the same value for both length and width in the formula for the area of a rectangle.
The volume of a solid object is how much space it takes up.
It’s easy to calculate the volume of a solid if it has a simple, regular shape, such as the rectangular solid pictured in the sketch below.
To find the volume of a rectangular solid, use this formula:
Volume (rectangular solid) = length × width × height (l × w × h)
Q:
What is the volume of the blue rectangular solid?
A:
Substitute the values for the rectangular solid’s length, width, and height into the formula for volume:
Volume = 10 cm × 3 cm × 5 cm = 150 cm 3
Density is a quantity that expresses how much matter is packed into a given space.
The amount of matter is its mass, and the space it takes up is its volume.
To calculate the density of an object, then, you would use this formula:
\text{Density} = \dfrac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}
