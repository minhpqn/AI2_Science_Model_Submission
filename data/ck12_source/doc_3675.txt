Genes play an important role in determining an organism’s characteristics.
However, for many characteristics, the individual’s phenotype is influenced by other factors as well.
Environmental factors, such as sunlight and food availability, can affect how genes are expressed in the phenotype of individuals.
Here are just two examples:
Genes play an important part in determining our adult height.
However, factors such as poor nutrition can prevent us from achieving our full genetic potential.
Genes are a major determinant of human skin color.
However, exposure to ultraviolet radiation can increase the amount of pigment in the skin and make it appear darker.
Many characteristics have more complex inheritance patterns than those studied by Mendel.
They are complicated by factors such as codominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles, and environmental influences.
