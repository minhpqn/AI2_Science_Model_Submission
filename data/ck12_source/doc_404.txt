Lymph vessels are tube-shaped, just like blood vessels, with about 500-600 lymph nodes (in an adult) attached.
The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to return body fluids to the blood.
The lymphatic system and the cardiovascular system are often called the body’s two "circulatory systems."
Organs of the lymphatic system include the tonsils, thymus gland and spleen.
The thymus gland produces T cells or T-lymphocytes (see below) and the spleen and tonsils help in fighting infections.
The spleen’s main function is to filter the blood.
The spleen also detects viruses and bacteria and triggers the release of pathogen fighting cells.

The lymphatic system helps return fluid that leaks from the blood vessels back to the cardiovascular system.
Role of the Lymphatic System in Circulation
You may think that your blood vessels have thick walls without any leaks, but that's not true.
Blood vessels can leak just like any other pipe.
The lymphatic system makes sure leaked blood returns back to the bloodstream.
When a small amount of fluid leaks out from the blood vessels, it collects in the spaces between cells and tissues.
Some of the fluid returns to the cardiovascular system, and the rest is collected by the lymph vessels of the lymphatic system ( Figure below ).
The fluid that collects in the lymph vessels is called lymph.
The lymphatic system then returns the lymph to the cardiovascular system.
Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed (meaning it is an open circulatory system that releases and collects fluid) and has no central pump (or heart).
Lymph moves slowly in lymph vessels.
It is moved along in the lymph vessels by the squeezing action of smooth muscles and skeletal muscles.
