The Figure below shows the atomic emission spectrum of hydrogen.
Atomic emission spectrum of hydrogen, helium, and iron
When light from a hydrogen gas discharge tube is passed through a prism, the light is split into four visible lines.
Each of these spectral lines corresponds to a different electron transition from a higher energy state to a lower energy state.
Every element has a unique atomic emission spectrum, as shown by the examples of helium (He) and iron (Fe).
Classical theory was unable to explain the existence of atomic emission spectra, also known as line-emission spectra.
According to classical physics, a ground state atom would be able to absorb any amount of energy rather than only discrete amounts.
Likewise, when the atoms relaxed back to a lower energy state, any amount of energy could be released.
This would result in what is known a continuous spectrum , where all wavelengths and frequencies are represented.
White light viewed through a prism and a rainbow are examples of continuous spectra.
Atomic emission spectra were more proof of the quantized nature of light and led to a new model of the atom based on quantum theory.
Atomic emission spectra are produced when excited electrons return to ground state.
The emitted light corresponds to energies of the specific electrons.
