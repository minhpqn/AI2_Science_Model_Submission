Foods to Reduce
Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals - and choose the foods with lower numbers.
Drink water instead of sugary drinks.
Packaged foods are required by law to carry a nutrition facts label, like the one in Figure below .
The labels show the nutrient content and ingredients of foods.
Reading labels can help you choose foods that are high in nutrients you need more of (such as proteins) and low in nutrients you need less of (such as fats).
Nutritional facts label
Nutrition facts labels like this one can help you make good food choices.
You should also look for ingredients such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.
Avoid foods that contain processed ingredients, such as white flour or white rice.
Processing removes nutrients.
As a result, processed foods generally supply fewer nutrients than whole foods, even when they have been enriched or fortified with added nutrients.
Weight Gain and Obesity
Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat.
An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat.
People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese.
Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater.
Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body.
It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters).
Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
