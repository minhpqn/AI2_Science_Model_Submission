What is the area of the square now?
Include a sketch.
A rectangular solid has a square face with sides 5 \;\mathrm{cm} in length, and a length of 10 \;\mathrm{cm} .
What is the volume of the solid in \;\mathrm{cm}^3 ?
Sketch the object, including the dimensions in your sketch.
As you know, a cube with each side 4 \;\mathrm{m} in length has a volume of 64 \;\mathrm{m}^3 .
Each side of the cube is now doubled in length.
What is the ratio of the new volume to the old volume?
Why is this ratio not simply 2 ?
Include a sketch with dimensions.
What is the ratio of the mass of the Earth to the mass of a single proton? (See equation sheet.)
A spacecraft can travel 20 \;\mathrm{km/s} .
How many km can this spacecraft travel in 1 hour \;\mathrm{(h)} ?
8:1, each side goes up by 2 \;\mathrm{cm} , so it will change by
3.5 \times 10^{51}:1
Convert units from metric to English system and vice versa using dimensional analysis.
Students will learn how to convert units from metric to English system and vice versa using dimensional analysis.
1\ \text{meter} & = 3.28\ \text{feet} && \\\1\ \text{mile} & = 1.61 \text{~kilometers} && \\\1\ \text{lb. (1\ pound)} & = 4.45\ \text{Newtons}
The key to converting units is to multiply by a clever factor of one.
You can always multiply by 1, because it does not change the number.
