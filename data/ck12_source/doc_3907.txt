What is the role of camouflage in prey and predator?
Distinguish between intraspecific and interspecific competition.
Explain why interspecific competition leads to extinction or greater specialization.
Does there have to be a winner?
When animals compete?
Yes.
Animals, or other organisms, will compete when both want the same thing.
One must "lose" so the winner can have the resource.
But competition doesn't necessarily involve physical altercations.
Competition is a relationship between organisms that strive for the same resources in the same place.
The resources might be food, water, or space.
There are two different types of competition:
Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the same species.
For example, two male birds of the same species might compete for mates in the same area.
This type of competition is a basic factor in natural selection.
It leads to the evolution of better adaptations within a species.
Interspecific competition occurs between members of different species.
For example, predators of different species might compete for the same prey.
Interspecific Competition and Extinction
Interspecific competition often leads to extinction .
