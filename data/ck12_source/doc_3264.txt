It contains other colors as well.
In fact, a rainbow contains all of the colors of visible light.
Wavelength and Color
Visible light is light that has wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye.
The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the light appears.
As you can see in the Figure below , light with the longest wavelength appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength appears violet.
In between are all the other colors of light that we can see.
Only seven main colors of light are actually represented in the diagram.

Separating Colors of Light
A prism, like the one in the Figure below , can be used to separate visible light into its different colors.
A prism is a pyramid-shaped object made of transparent matter, usually clear glass or plastic.
Matter that is transparent allows light to pass through it.
A prism transmits light but slows it down.
When light passes from air to the glass of the prism, the change in speed causes the light to change direction and bend.
Different wavelengths of light bend at different angles.
This makes the beam of light separate into light of different wavelengths.
What we see is a rainbow of colors.
