If you have a compass and you find north, you can then know any other direction.
See the directions, such as east, south, west, etc., on a compass rose
Picture of a compass and a compass rose
(a) A compass is a device that is used to determine direction.
The needle points to Earth’s magnetic north pole. (b) A compass rose shows the four major directions, plus intermediates between them.
A compass needle lines up with Earth’s magnetic north pole.
This is different from Earth’s geographic north pole, also called true north.
The geographic north pole is the top of an imaginary line.
This line is the axis around which Earth rotates.
The geographic north pole is much like the spindle of a spinning top.
The location of the geographic north pole does not change.
However, the magnetic north pole shifts in location over time.
Depending on where you live, you can correct for the difference between the two poles when you use a map and a compass ( Figure below ).
Earth’s magnetic north pole is about 11 degrees offset from its geographic north pole
Earth’s magnetic north pole is about 11 degrees offset from its geographic north pole.
Some maps have a double compass rose.
This allows users to make the corrections between magnetic north and true north.
An example is a nautical chart that boaters use to chart their positions at sea ( Figure below ).
Nautical maps include a double compass rose that shows both magnetic directions and geographic compass directions
Nautical maps include a double compass rose that shows both magnetic directions (inner circle) and geographic compass directions (outer circle).
