The Cell Cycle
Cell division is just one of several stages that a cell goes through during its lifetime.
The cell cycle is a repeating series of events that include growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division.
The cell cycle in prokaryotes is quite simple: the cell grows, its DNA replicates, and the cell divides.
In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated.
The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
The diagram in Figure below represents the cell cycle of a eukaryotic cell.
As you can see, the eukaryotic cell cycle has several phases.
The mitotic phase (M) actually includes both mitosis and cytokinesis.
This is when the nucleus and then the cytoplasm divide.
The other three phases (G1, S, and G2) are generally grouped together as interphase .
During interphase, the cell grows, performs routine life processes, and prepares to divide.
These phases are discussed below.
You can watch a eukaryotic cell going through these phases of the cell cycle at the following link:

This diagram represents the cell cycle in eukaryotes.
The First Gap, Synthesis, and Second Gap phases make up interphase (I).
The M (mitotic) phase includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
After the M phase, two cells result.
