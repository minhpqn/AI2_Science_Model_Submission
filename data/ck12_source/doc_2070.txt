The Sources of Earth's Energy
Almost all energy comes from the Sun.
Plants make food energy from sunlight.
Fossil fuels are made of the remains of plants and animals that stored the Sun's energy millions of years ago.
The Sun heats some areas more than others, which causes wind.
The Sun's energy also drives the water cycle, which moves water over the surface of Earth.
Both wind and water power can be used as renewable resources.
Earth's internal heat does not depend on the Sun for energy.
This heat comes from remnant heat when the planet formed.
It also comes from the decay of radioactive elements.
Radioactivity is an important source of energy.
Energy is the ability to do work or change matter.
Energy from the Sun drives atmospheric processes on Earth, which leads to wind.
