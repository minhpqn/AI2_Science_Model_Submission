But what if crops could be developed to withstand these harsh conditions?
Biotechnology will allow the development of crops containing genes that will help them to withstand harsh conditions.
For example, drought and salty soil are two significant factors affecting how well crops grow.
But there are crops that can withstand these harsh conditions.
Why?
Probably because of that plant's genetics.
So scientists are studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions.
They hope to identify and isolate the genes that control these beneficial traits.
The genes could then be transferred into more desirable crops, with the hope of producing the same traits in those crops.
Thale cress ( Figure below ), a species of Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), is a tiny weed that has been extensively studied.
It is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow, and its DNA has been mapped.
Scientists have identified a gene from this plant, At-DBF2, that gives the plant resistance to some environmental stresses.
When this gene is inserted into tomato and tobacco cells, the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses like salt, drought, cold, and heat far better than ordinary cells.
If these results prove successful in larger trials, then At-DBF2 genes could help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments.

Genetic alteration can be used to change many different phenotypes of plants.
Transgenic crops have extra genes that were placed into them to give the crop a beneficial trait.
In the future, crops may be genetically altered to withstand harsh conditions.
