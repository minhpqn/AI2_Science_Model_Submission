A plan for asking questions and testing possible answers.
scientific methods :
Procedures based on gathering observable, empirical (produced by experiment or observation) and measurable evidence that is critically evaluated.
Scientific investigations involve the collection of data through observation, the formation and testing of hypotheses by experimentation, and analysis of the results that involves reasoning.
Describe the scientific method.
What is an hypothesis?
How is a hypothesis developed and evaluated?
What is meant by falsifiable?
What happens if a hypothesis is false?
Scientific Reasoning - Advanced
Outline the role that reasoning plays in examining hypotheses.
Define and compare inductive and deductive reasoning.
What does it mean to reason ?
"What does the data show?
Did the experiment work?
Is the hypothesis correct?" Reasoning is the human process used to make sense of things.
Reasoning is also used to establish and verify facts. "Scientific reasoning" is no different than everyday reasoning - it is used to make sense of things related to the scientific process, such as conclusions based on the results of an experiment.
Any useful hypothesis will allow predictions based on reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories: deduction and induction.
Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
