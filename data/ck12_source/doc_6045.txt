Substances that exhibit hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole forces are generally water soluble, whereas those that exhibit only London dispersion forces are generally insoluble.
Most, but not all, ionic compounds are quite soluble in water.
Table below summarizes some of the differences between ionic and molecular compounds.
Comparison of Ionic and Molecular Compounds
Type of elements
metal and nonmetal
ionic – transfer of electron(s) between atoms
covalent – sharing of pair(s) of electrons between atoms
Physical state at room temp.
gas, liquid, or solid
Melting and boiling temps
good when molten or in solution
One type of molecular compound behaves quite differently than that described so far.
A covalent network solid is a compound in which all of the atoms are connected to one another by covalent bonds.
Diamond is composed entirely of carbon atoms, each bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral geometry.
Melting a covalent network solid is not accomplished by overcoming the relatively weak intermolecular forces.
Rather, all of the covalent bonds must be broken, a process that requires extremely high temperatures.
Diamond, in fact, does not melt at all.
Instead, it vaporizes to a gas at temperatures above 3500°C.
The physical properties of a material are affected by the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together.
