Keep in mind that viruses are nonliving, so can they be killed?
The Herpes simplex virus causes cold sores on the lips
The Herpes simplex virus, which is represented here, causes cold sores on the lips.
Viruses are extremely small particles.
This illustration is greatly magnified.
How Pathogens Spread
Different pathogens spread in different ways.
Some pathogens spread through food.
They cause food borne illnesses, which are discussed in a previous concept.
Some pathogens spread through water.
Giardia lamblia is one example.
Water can be boiled to kill Giardia and most other pathogens.
Several pathogens spread through sexual contact.
HIV is one example, which is discussed in the next concept.
Other pathogens that spread through sexual contact are discussed in a separate concept.
Many pathogens that cause respiratory diseases spread by droplets in the air.
Droplets are released when a person sneezes or coughs.
Thousands of tiny droplets are released when a person sneezes ( Figure below ).
Each droplet can contain thousands of pathogens.
Viruses that cause colds and the flu can spread in this way.
