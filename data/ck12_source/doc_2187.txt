Even though there is a very small amount of water, there is no atmosphere.
Temperatures are extreme.
So it comes as no surprise that there has not been evidence of life on the Moon.
Like Earth, the Moon has a distinct crust, mantle, and core.
The crust is composed of igneous rock.
This rock is rich in the elements oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum.
On the near side, the Moon’s crust is about 30 kilometers thick.
On the far side, the crust is about 100 kilometers thick.
The mantle is made of rock like Earth’s upper mantle.
The Moon has a small metallic core, perhaps 300 to 500 kilometers in diameter.
The composition of the core is probably mostly iron with some sulfur and nickel.
We learned this both from the rock samples gathered by astronauts and from spacecraft sent to the Moon.
Humans have walked on only two planetary bodies:
Earth and the Moon.
The footprints the men left behind are the first signs of life ever on the Moon.
Scientists learned a great deal about the Moon from the Apollo missions.
The samples that were brought back have been studied in laboratories.
We know an incredible amount about the Moon because of these samples.
Having these rocks radically changed our thinking about the Moon.
The Moon is easily seen from Earth.
