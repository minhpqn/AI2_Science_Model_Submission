This would have to result from a genetic mutation.
Do these plants die because they cannot photosynthesize?
Not necessarily.
What can these plants tell us about the biochemistry, genetics and physiology of plants?

Mutations are essential for evolution to occur because they increase genetic variation and the potential for individuals to differ.
The majority of mutations are neutral in their effects on the organisms in which they occur.
Beneficial mutations may become more common through natural selection.
Harmful mutations may cause genetic disorders or cancer.
