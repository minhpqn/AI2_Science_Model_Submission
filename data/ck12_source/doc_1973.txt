For example, if b = 10 and d = 8, r = 2.
This means that the population is growing by 2 individuals per year for every 100 members of the population.
This may not sound like much, but it’s a fairly high rate of growth.
A population growing at this rate would double in size in just 35 years!
If the birth rate is less than the death rate, r is negative.
This means that the population is becoming smaller.
What do you think might cause this to happen?
A population can’t keep growing bigger and bigger forever.
Sooner or later, it will run out of things it needs.
For a given species, there is a maximum population that can be supported by the environment.
This maximum is called the carrying capacity .
When a population gets close to the carrying capacity, it usually grows more slowly ( Figure below ).
When the population reaches the carrying capacity, it stops growing.
A logistic growth curve
A population can’t get much larger than the carrying capacity.
What might happen if it did?
A population will grow as long as it has what it needs.
The carrying capacity of an environment is reached when the number of births equal the number of deaths.
A limiting factor determines the carrying capacity for a species.
