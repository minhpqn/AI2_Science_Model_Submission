Therefore, there are now four hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products.
Q:
Is equation 2 balanced?
A:
Count the oxygen atoms to find out.
There are two oxygen atoms in the one molecule of oxygen in the reactants.
There are also two oxygen atoms in the products, one in each of the two water molecules.
Therefore, equation 2 is balanced.
Steps in Balancing a Chemical Equation
Balancing a chemical equation involves a certain amount of trial and error.
In general, however, you should follow these steps:
Count each type of atom in reactants and products.
Does the same number of each atom appear on both sides of the arrow?
If not, the equation is not balanced, and you need to go to step 2.
Place coefficients, as needed, in front of the symbols or formulas to increase the number of atoms or molecules of the substances.
Use the smallest coefficients possible.
Warning!
Never change the subscripts in chemical formulas.
Changing subscripts changes the substances involved in the reaction.
Change only the coefficients.
