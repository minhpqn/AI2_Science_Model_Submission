In fission (or binary fission), a parent separates into two or more individuals of about equal size.
This type of reproduction is common among single-celled organisms including bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes, such as protists and some fungi.
The single cell divides into two daughter cells.
In fragmentation , a body breaks into several fragments, which later develop into complete organisms.
For example, a new starfish ( Figure below ) can develop from a single ray, or arm.
In addition to starfish, this type of reproduction is common among some worms, fungi and plants.
Many of these organisms are also capable of sexual reproduction.
Most lichens, which form from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and photosynthetic algae or bacteria, reproduce through fragmentation.
This ensures that new individuals contain both symbionts.
In budding , organisms reproduce by having new individuals split off from existing ones, which results in genetically identical parent and daughter organisms.
The bud may stay attached or break free from the parent.
Eukaryotic organisms, such as the single cell yeast and multicellular hydra, undergo budding ( Figure below ).
Starfish reproduce by fragmentation and yeasts reproduce by budding.
Both are types of asexual reproduction.
Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants.
This type of reproduction occurs when new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores.
The formation of new plants out of rhizomes or stolons is an example of vegetative reproductive, such as in the strawberry plant.
Other plants use this type of reproduction to reproduce through bulbs or tubers, or shoots and suckers that form along lateral roots.
See the Plant Biology concepts for additional information.
These strawberry plants reproduce by vegetative reproduction.
