Why have birds been so successful?
What traits allowed them to increase and diversify so rapidly?
Birds can vary considerably in size, as you can see from the world’s smallest and largest birds, pictured in Figure below .
The tiny bee hummingbird is just 5 centimeters (2 inches) long, whereas the ostrich towers over people at a height of 2.7 meters (9 feet).
All modern birds have wings, feathers, and beaks.
They have a number of other unique traits as well, most of which are adaptations for flight.
Flight is used by birds as a means of locomotion in order to find food and mates and to avoid predators.
Although not all modern birds can fly, they all evolved from ancestors that could.

Wings and Feathers
Wings are an obvious adaptation for flight.
They are actually modified front legs.
Birds move their wings using muscles in the chest.
These muscles are quite large, making up as much as 35 percent of a bird’s body weight.
Feathers help birds fly and also provide insulation and serve other purposes.
Birds actually have two basic types of feathers: flight feathers and down feathers.
Both are shown in Figure below .
