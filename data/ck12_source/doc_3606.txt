The mitotic spindle checkpoint occurs at the point in metaphase where all the chromosomes should have aligned at the mitotic plate.
Checkpoints control the cell cycle
Checkpoints in the eukaryotic cell cycle ensure that the cell is ready to proceed before it moves on to the next phase of the cycle.
Cancer and the Cell Cycle
Cancer is a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated.
This may happen because a cellâ€™s DNA becomes damaged.
Damage can occur due to exposure to hazards such as radiation or toxic chemicals.
Cancerous cells generally divide much faster than normal cells.
They may form a mass of abnormal cells called a tumor (see Figure below ).
The rapidly dividing cells take up nutrients and space that normal cells need.
This can damage tissues and organs and eventually lead to death.
Cancer cell tumor
These cells are cancer cells, growing out of control and forming a tumor.

The cell cycle is a repeating series of events that cells go through.
It includes growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division.
In eukaryotic cells, there are two growth phases, and cell division includes mitosis.
The cell cycle is controlled by regulatory proteins at three key checkpoints in the cycle.
The proteins signal the cell to either start or delay the next phase of the cycle.
