After that, living things could use oxygen to break down glucose and make ATP.
Today, most organisms make ATP with oxygen.
They follow glycolysis with the Krebs cycle and electron transport to make more ATP than by glycolysis alone.
Cellular respiration that proceeds in the presence of oxygen is called aerobic respiration .
Cellular respiration always begins with glycolysis, which can occur either in the absence or presence of oxygen.
Cellular respiration that proceeds in the absence of oxygen is anaerobic respiration.
Cellular respiration that proceeds in the presence of oxygen is aerobic respiration.
Anaerobic respiration evolved prior to aerobic respiration.
