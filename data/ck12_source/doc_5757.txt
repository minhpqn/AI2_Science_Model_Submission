A Closer Look
Although all group 1 elements share certain properties, such as being very reactive, they are not alike in every way.
Three different group 1 elements are described in more detail below ( Figures below , below , and below ).
Notice the ways in which they differ from one another.
Molecule of hydrogen gas
Hydrogen has the smallest, lightest atoms of all elements.
Pure hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is nontoxic but highly flammable.
Hydrogen gas exists mainly as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules (H 2 ), as shown in the diagram on the right.
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and the third most abundant element on Earth, occurring mainly in compounds such as water.
Q:
Why do you think hydrogen gas usually exists as diatomic molecules?
A:
Each hydrogen atom has just one electron.
When two hydrogen atoms bond together, they share a pair of electrons.
The shared electrons fill their only energy level, giving them the most stable arrangement of electrons.
Potassium is included in fertilizer
Potassium is a soft, silvery metal that ignites explosively in water.
It easily loses its one valence electron to form positive potassium ions (K + ), which are needed by all living cells.
Potassium is so important for plants that it is found in almost all fertilizers, like the one shown here.
