What Makes an Earthquake Deadly?
What makes an earthquake deadly?
Population density.
The magnitude 9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, of 1964 resulted in only 131 deaths.
At the time few people lived in the area ( Figure below ).

Size, but not size.
No one dies in a magnitude 1.0 earthquake.
But large quakes to not always kill a lot of people.
Only about 2,000 people died in the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake.
This was the largest earthquake ever recorded.
The Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 was one of the largest ever.
Still, most of the 230,000 fatalities were caused by the tsunami, not the earthquake.
Ground type.
Solid bedrock vibrates less than soft sediments, so there is less damage on bedrock.
Sometimes sediments become saturated with water.
They then undergo liquefaction and become like quicksand ( Figure below ).
Soil on a hillside may become a landslide.
Liquefaction of sediments in Mexico City caused the collapse of many buildings in the 1985 earthquake
