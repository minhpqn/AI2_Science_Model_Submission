Trash is thrown overboard by many vessels.
Fishing boats throw over lines and nets.
There is a very large patch of garbage known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
Trash from the lands all around the North Pacific gets caught up in currents.
The currents bring the trash into the center of the North Pacific Gyre.
The concentration of trash increases toward the center of the gyre.
While recognizable pieces of garbage are visible, much of the trash is tiny plastic molecules.
The molecules are invisible but are seen in water samples.
Plastic confetti-like pieces are also found in the gyre.
The size of the garbage patch is unknown, since it can’t be seen from above.
Some people estimate that it’s twice the size of continental U.S, with a mass of 100 million tons.
Effect on Organisms
Animals can be harmed or killed by trash in the oceans.
Seabirds and mammals may sometimes accidentally eat plastic bags.
This may kill the animals.
Fishing nets can entangle fish and other animals so that they cannot escape.
Plastic molecules are ingested by organisms.
Some that filter water for nutrients may take in a lot of plastic molecules.
They may eventually die.
Larger fish or humans eat them and may take in the plastics too.
