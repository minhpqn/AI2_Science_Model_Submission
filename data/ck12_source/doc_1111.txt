Science is different from other ways of understanding the world.
Science has a rigorous method of getting information.
A scientific idea must be testable; it must be falsifiable.
Scientific ideas are not the result of opinion, gut feelings, or faith.
Ideas that are not supported by observations and data are revised or thrown out.
Scientists use the scientific method to answer questions about the natural world.
The scientific method is not linear.
A step may need to be revised or thrown out.
New data send the scientist back to the beginning.
Still scientific inquiry takes on this basic structure:
Ask a question.
Do background research.
