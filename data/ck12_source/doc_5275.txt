Describe two X-linked phenotypes.
Genetic Disorders - Advanced
Describe the difference between a genetic trait and a genetic disease/disorder.
Gives examples of dominant and recessive genetic disorders.
Is being short-statured inherited?
It can be.
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism in humans, and it is caused by a dominant mutation.
The mutation can be passed from one generation to the next.
Over 95% of unrelated individuals with Achondroplasia have the same mutation, making it one of the most common mutations in the human genome.
Why?
Mutations and Genetic Disorders
Mutations , changes in the DNA or RNA sequence, can have significant phenotypic effects or they can have no effects.
What are possible outcomes of some of those mutations.
Some can produce genetic disorder .
A genetic disorder is a condition caused by abnormalities, such as mutations, in your genes or chromosomes.
Genetic disorders are usually present from conception.
These disorders include chromosomal abnormalities, in which the individual has too few or too many chromosomes or chromosomes with large alterations, or diseases due to a mutation in a specific gene.
These defective genes are usually inherited from the parents, hence the term hereditary disease or genetic disorder.
Genetic disorders can be inherited in a dominant or recessive manner ( Figure below and Figure below ).
Recessive disorders require the inheritance of a defective gene from each parent.
