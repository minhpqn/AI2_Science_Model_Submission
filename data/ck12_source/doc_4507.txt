In neurons with myelin sheaths, ions flow across the membrane only at the nodes between sections of myelin.
As a result, the action potential jumps along the axon membrane from node to node, rather than spreading smoothly along the entire membrane.
This increases the speed at which it travels.
The action potential is discussed at (18:53) and

The place where an axon terminal meets another cell is called a synapse .
The axon terminal and other cell are separated by a narrow space known as a synaptic cleft (see Figure below ).
When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, the axon terminal releases molecules of a chemical called a neurotransmitter .
The neurotransmitter molecules travel across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the membrane of the other cell.
If the other cell is a neuron, this starts an action potential in the other cell.
You can view animations of neurotransmission at a synapse at the following links:

At a synapse, neurotransmitters are released by the axon terminal.
They bind with receptors on the other cell.

A nerve impulse begins when a neuron receives a chemical stimulus.
