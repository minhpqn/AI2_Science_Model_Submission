What did that process look like?
Alfred Wegener , born in 1880, was a meteorologist and explorer.
In 1910, he noticed that South America and Africa appeared to fit together like puzzle pieces.
He was certainly not the first person to notice this.
But he was intrigued by the idea and thought a lot about it.
He wondered if the two continents were once joined and then moved apart?
He set out to find evidence to support or refute this idea.
Here is the main evidence that Wegener and his supporters collected for his continental drift hypothesis:
Fit of the Continents
The continents appear to fit together, and not just South America and Africa.
If the continental margins are included, the fit is even better.
Continental drift from Pangaea to now
This figure shows the evolution of the continents, from the super-continent Pangaea to the way they look now.
Distribution of Fossils
Wegener found fossil evidence that the continents were once joined ( Figure below ).
The same type of plant and animal fossils are found on continents that are now widely separated.
These organisms would not have been able to travel across the oceans.
So how did the fossils get so far apart?
Fossils of the seed fern Glossopteris are found across all of the southern continents.
These seeds are too heavy to be carried across the ocean by wind.
