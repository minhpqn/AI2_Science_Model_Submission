Many people would view this dish as a tasty treat.
As you can see, one way amphibians are important to people is that they can be used as a food source.
Role of Amphibians
Humans have used amphibians for a number of purposes for thousands of years, if not longer.
Amphibians play significant roles in many food webs and are thus an important part of many ecosystems.
For example, frogs keep insect populations stable.
Extinction of frogs, or just significant decreases in the frog population, would probably have serious consequences for agricultural crops.
Humans have also consumed amphibians, especially frogs, probably since they first ate meat.
More recently, amphibians have been tremendously useful in research.
Amphibians as Foods
Amphibians play important roles in many ecosystems, especially as middle players in many food chains and food webs.
In addition to consuming many worms and insects and other arthropods, and even some small reptiles and mammals and fish, they are prey for turtles and snakes, as well as some fish and birds.
Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae.
Frogs are raised as a food source for humans.
Frog legs are a delicacy in China, France, the Philippines, northern Greece, and the American south, especially the Frensh-speaking parts of Louisiana.
Only the upper joint of the hind leg is served, which has a single bone similar to the upper joint of a chicken or turkey wing.
They are commonly prepared by grilling or deep frying, sometimes breaded, though they can also be served with garlic, or turned into a soup or stew.
Some estimates have well over a billion frogs harvested a year as food.
That's about one frog harvested for every seven people on the planet.
