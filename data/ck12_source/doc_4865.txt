What are ways to "get around" the SA:V ratio?
What limits the size of a cell?
Why?
A cell has a volume of 64 units, and total surface area of 96 units.
What is the cell's surface area to volume ratio?
What is the largest single cell?
Describe the relationship between cell shape and function?
Give an example of cell shape influencing cell function.
Common Parts of Cells - Advanced
Identify the parts common to all cells.
What do your cells share with a bacterium?
This bacterial cell has the features all cells have in common-the ribosomes and DNA can be seen floating around in the cytoplasm, which is surrounded by the plasma membrane.
Parts of a Cell
There are many different types of cells, but all cells fall into two general categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic .
These cells can be vastly different, but still similar in some ways.
All cells, whether from a simple bacterium or a cell from a large whale, have a few things in common.
These are:
a cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane)
DNA (genetic information)
The cell membrane (also called the plasma membrane ) is the physical boundary between the intracellular space (the inside of the cell) and the extracellular environment.
