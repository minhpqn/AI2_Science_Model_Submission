The result - it was almost completely ignored.
Von Nageli instead sent hawkweed seeds to Mendel, which he thought was a better plant for studying heredity.
Unfortunately hawkweed reproduces asexually, resulting in genetically identical clones of the parent.
Charles Darwin published his landmark book on evolution in 1869, not long after Mendel had discovered his laws.
Unfortunately, Darwin knew nothing of Mendel's discoveries and didn’t understand heredity.
This made his arguments about evolution less convincing to many people.
This example demonstrates the importance for scientists to communicate the results of their investigations.
Rediscovering Mendel’s Work
Mendel’s work was virtually unknown until 1900.
In that year, three different European scientists — named Hugo De Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich Von Tschermak-Seysenegg — independently arrived at Mendel’s laws.
All three had done experiments similar to Mendel’s.
They came to the same conclusions that he had drawn almost half a century earlier.
Only then was Mendel’s actual work rediscovered.
As scientists learned more about heredity - the passing of traits from parents to offspring - over the next few decades, they were able to describe Mendel’s ideas about inheritance in terms of genes.
In this way, the field of genetics was born.
At the link that follows, you can watch an animation of Mendel explaining his laws of inheritance in genetic terms.
Genetics of Inheritance
Today, we known that characteristics of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes (see Figure below ).
The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus .
In sexually reproducing organisms, each individual has two copies of the same gene, as there are two versions of the same chromosome ( homologous chromosomes ).
