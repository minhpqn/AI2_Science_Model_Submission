The absolute difference between ENs is |0.93 - 3.2| = 2.27.
This value is greater than 1.7, and therefore indicates a complete electron exchange occurs.
Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom to attract the electrons when the atom is part of a compound.
Electronegativity values generally increase from left to right across the periodic table.
Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom of a group.
The highest electronegativity value is for fluorine.
