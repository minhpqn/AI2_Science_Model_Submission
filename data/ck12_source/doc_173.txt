Common Prefixes Used with SI Units
These prefixes are defined using scientific notation.
This notation is explained in the Mathematics Tools for Physics section.
Numbers with different prefixes can be shown as equalities when they are equivalent measurements.
For example, 1 meter = 100 centimeters.
Similarly, 0.01 meters = 1 centimenter.
These equivalencies are used as conversion factors when units need to be converted.
Example:
Convert 500. millimeters to meters.
The equivalency statement for millimeters and meters is 1000 mm = 1 m.
To convert 500. mm to m, we multiply 500. mm by a conversion factor that will cancel the millimeter units and generate the meter units.
This requires that the conversion factor has meters in the numerator and millimeters in the denominator.
To convert 500. millimeters to meters, we multiply 500. mm by a conversion factor
mm is equivalent to 0.5 m.
Example:
Convert 11 Âµg to mg.
When converting from one prefix to another, such as in this problem, it is usually easiest to convert through the base unit.
In this case, the base unit is grams, so we use the two following equivalency statements:
1 \times 10^6 \ \mu \text{g} = 1 \ \text{g and} \ 1000 \ \text{mg} = 1 \ \text{g}
The first conversion factor converts from micrograms to grams and the second conversion factor converts from grams to milligrams.
