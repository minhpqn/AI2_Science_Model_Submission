Astronomy is the study of outer space and the physical bodies beyond planet Earth.
Astronomers use telescopes to see things far beyond what the human eye can see.
Astronomers help to design spacecrafts or satellites that travel into space and send back information about faraway places ( Figure below ).

Astronomers ask a wide variety of questions.
How do strong bursts of energy from the Sun, called solar flares, affect communications?
How might an impact from an asteroid affect life on Earth?
What are the properties of black holes?
Astronomers ask bigger questions too.
How was the Universe created?
Is there life on other planets?
Are there resources on other planets that people could use for space travel?
Astronomers use what Earth scientists know about our planet to make comparisons with other planets.
