For example, they can grow in hot springs, geysers, and near volcanoes.
Unlike other organisms, they can thrive in temperatures near 100Â°C, the boiling point of water!
Methanogens can also live in some strange places, such as swamps and inside the guts of cows and termites.
They help these animals break down cellulose, a tough carbohydrate made by plants ( Figure below ).
This is an example of a mutualistic relationship.
Methanogens are named for their waste product, a gas called methane.
Cows are able to digest grass with the help of the bacteria methanogens in their gut
Cows are able to digest grass with the help of the methanogens in their gut.
Although archaea are known for living in unusual environments, such as the Dead Sea, inside hot springs, and in the guts of cows, they also live in more common environments.
For example, new research shows that archaea are abundant in the soil.
They also live among the plankton in the ocean ( Figure below ).
Therefore, scientists are just beginning to discover some of the important roles that archaea have in the environment.
Thermococcus gammatolerans are another type of archaea
Thermococcus gammatolerans are another type of archaea.
Archaea that live in salty environments are known as halophiles.
Archaea that live in extremely hot environments are called thermophiles.
Archaea that produce methane are called methanogens.
Archaea are known for living in extreme environments, but they also can be found in common environments, like soil.
