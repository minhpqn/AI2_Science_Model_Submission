The half-reactions can be written:
& \text{Oxidation:} \quad \text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}+2e^- \\& \text{Reduction:} \quad \text{S}+2e^- \rightarrow \text{S}^{2-}
In the reaction above, the zinc is being oxidized by losing electrons.
However, there must be another substance present that gains those electrons and in this case that is the sulfur.
In other words, the sulfur is causing the zinc to be oxidized.
Sulfur is called the oxidizing agent.
The zinc causes the sulfur to gain electrons and become reduced and so the zinc is called the reducing agent.
The oxidizing agent is a substance that causes oxidation by accepting electrons.
The reducing agent is a substance that causes reduction by losing electrons.
The simplest way to think of this is that the oxidizing agent is the substance that is reduced, while the reducing agent is the substance that is oxidized.
The sample problem below shows how to analyze a redox reaction.
Sample Problem:
Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
When chlorine gas is bubbled into a solution of sodium bromide, a reaction occurs which produces aqueous sodium chloride and bromine.
Determine what is being oxidized and what is being reduced.
Identify the oxidizing and reducing agents.
\text{Cl}_2(g)+2\text{NaBr}(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{Br}_2(l)
Step 1:
Plan the problem .
Break the reaction down into a net ionic equation and then into half-reactions.
