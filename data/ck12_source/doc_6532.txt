Minibus prototype that runs on propane
As our country looks at the prospect of oil shortages in the future, we are searching for alternative transportation fuel sources.
One very viable possibility is propane gas.
Power and acceleration for propane-powered vehicles are comparable to gasoline-powered vehicles and fuel efficiency is greater.
Propane has a higher octane rating than regular gasoline, leading to much longer engine life.
