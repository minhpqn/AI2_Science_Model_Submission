The hyphae and mycelia help the fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms.
Most of the mycelium is hidden from view deep within the fungal food source, such as rotting matter in the soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or dead animals.
Fungi produce enzymes to digest cellulose and various other materials found in rotting matter, helping with the decaying process.
Specialized structures for reproduction:
One example is a fruiting body.
Just like a fruit is involved in the reproduction of a fruiting plant, a fruiting body is involved in the reproduction of a fungus.
A mushroom is a fruiting body , which is the part of the fungus that produces spores ( Figure below ).
The spores are the basic reproductive units of fungi.
The mycelium remains hidden until it develops one or more fruiting bodies.
The fruiting bodies are usually produced at the surface of the food source, rather than hidden within it.
This allows the reproductive spores to be easily shed and carried away by the wind, water, or animals.
The fruiting bodies are usually the only indication that a fungus is present.
Like icebergs, the fruiting bodies represent only a tiny fraction of the whole fungus, with most of the fungus hidden from view.

The little “trees” are specialized hyphae on which spores are produced.

A mushroom is a fruiting body.
Fungi have a cell wall.
The fungal body consists of thread-like structures called hyphae, which can bunch up into a mycelium.
