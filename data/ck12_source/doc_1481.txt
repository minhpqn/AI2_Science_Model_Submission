Describe types of tides.
Explain what causes tides.
Did you ever build a sandcastle?
A sandcastle only lasts until the next tide comes in.
To build a sand castle the sand must be moist enough for the grains to stick together.
So it has to be near the water.
But that puts the castle in position to be buried by the next high tide.
Oh well.
You can build another one when the tide goes back out!
Tides are daily changes in the level of ocean water.
They occur all around the globe.
High tides occur when the water reaches its highest level in a day.
