Parts of the Southwestern United States also receive monsoon rains.
These rains break the summer heat.
They also provide water to desert plants.
With winter rains and summer rains, these deserts are more lush than many.
Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area.
Local winds blow between small low and high pressure systems.
They are influenced by local geography.
Nearness to an ocean, lake, or mountain range can affect local winds.
Some examples are found below.
Local winds can affect the weather and climate of a region.
Land and Sea Breezes
Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land.
So the sea surface is cooler than the land in the daytime.
It is also cooler than the land in the summer.
The opposite is also true.
The water stays warmer than the land during the night and the winter.
These differences in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes ( Figure below ).
A sea breeze blows from sea to land during the day or in summer.
Thatâ€™s when air over the land is warmer than air over the water.
The warm air rises.
