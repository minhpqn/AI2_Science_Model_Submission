double helix :
The double spiral shape of the DNA molecule; resembles a spiral staircase.
genome :
The complete set of an organism's hereditary information; may be either DNA or, for many types of virus, RNA; includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA.
hydrogen bond :
A weak bond between two molecules resulting from an electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an electronegative atom in the other; always involves a hydrogen atom.
nucleotide :
Monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar, and a phosphate group.
purine :
Nitrogenous bases consisting of two ring structures; adenine and guanine.
pyrimidine :
Nitrogenous bases consisting of one ring structure; thymine and cytosine.
sugar-phosphate backbone :
The major structural component of the DNA molecule; formed of alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds.
Watson and Crick demonstrated the double helix model of DNA.
The two strands of the DNA double helix are complementary and run in anti-parallel directions.
