Anaerobic Respiration - Advanced
Distinguish between obligate aerobes, obligate anaerobes, and facultative anaerobes.
Explain that, in the absence of oxygen fermentation reactions must regenerate NAD + in order for glycolysis to continue making ATP.
Discuss how your muscles continue to work for you even when your respiratory and cardiovascular system can no longer keep up a continuous supply of oxygen.
Why does a bakery smell so good?
When bread bakes, yeast releases carbon dioxide gas, forming the small holes in bread.
The gas was produced by alcoholic fermentation carried out by yeast.
After the photosynthetic “oxygen catastrophe” challenged life between 2.5 and 3 billion years ago, evolution rebounded with biochemical pathways to harness and protect against oxygen’s power.
Today, most organisms use O 2 in aerobic respiration to produce ATP.
Almost all animals, most fungi, and some bacteria are obligate aerobes , which require oxygen.
Some plants and fungi and many bacteria retain the ability to make ATP without oxygen.
Recall that O 2 is the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain during aerobic respiration.
Oxygen is required for oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.
But in the absence of O 2 .
ATP must still be made.
The facultative anaerobes use ancient anaerobic pathways when oxygen is limited.
A few bacteria remain as obligate anaerobes , which die in the presence of oxygen and depend on only the first (anaerobic) stage of cellular respiration.
Aerobic and anaerobic pathways diverge after glycolysis splits glucose into two molecules of pyruvate:
