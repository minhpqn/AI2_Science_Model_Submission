Codominance of red and white petals in a flower
Codominance.
The flower has red and white petals because of codominance of red-petal and white-petal alleles.
Incomplete dominance occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele does not occur.
For example, when red snapdragons (C R C R ) are crossed with white snapdragons (C W C W ), the F 1 hybrids are all pink heterozygotes for flower color (C R C W ).
The pink color is an intermediate between the two parent colors.
When two F 1 (C R C W ) hybrids are crossed they will produce red, pink, and white flowers.
The genotype of an organism with incomplete dominance can be determined from its phenotype ( Figure below ).
Pink petals of a flower due to incomplete dominance
Incomplete Dominance.
The flower has pink petals because of incomplete dominance of a red-petal allele and a recessive white-petal allele.
Many genes have multiple (more than two) alleles.
An example is ABO blood type in humans.
There are three common alleles for the gene that controls this characteristic.
The alleles I A and I B are dominant over i.
A person who is homozygous recessive ii has type O blood.
Homozygous dominant I A I A or heterozygous dominant I A i have type A blood, and homozygous dominant I B I B or heterozygous dominant I B i have type B blood.
I A I B people have type AB blood, because the A and B alleles are codominant.
Type A and type B parents can have a type AB child.
Type A and type B parents can also have a child with Type O blood, if they are both heterozygous ( I B i , I A i ).
