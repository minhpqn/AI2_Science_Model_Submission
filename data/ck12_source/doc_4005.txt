Virally coded proteins will self-assemble to form a capsid.
Some viruses have an envelope of phospholipids and proteins.
The envelope is made from portions of the host’s cell membrane.
It surrounds the capsid and helps protect the virus from the host’s immune system.
The envelope may also have receptor molecules that can bind with host cells.
They make it easier for the virus to infect the cells.

The capsid encloses the genetic material of the virus.
The envelope which surrounds the capsid is typically made from portions of the host cell membranes (phospholipids and proteins).
Not all viruses have a viral envelope.
Helical capsids are made up of a single type of protein subunit stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure.
The helix may have a hollow center, which makes it look like a hollow tube.
This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions.
These virions can be anything from short and very rigid, to long and very flexible.
The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is an example of a helical virus, as seen in the Figure below .

Although their diameter may be very small, some helical viruses can be quite long, as shown here. 1.
