Some protists are free-living organisms.
Others are involved in symbiotic relationships.
They live in or on other organisms, including humans.
Motility of Protists
Most protists have motility .
This is the ability to move.
Protists have three types of appendages for movement.
As shown in Figure below , they may have flagella, cilia , or pseudopods (“false feet”).
There may be one or more whip-like flagella.
Cilia are similar to flagella, except they are shorter and there are more of them.
They may completely cover the surface of the protist cell.
Pseudopods are temporary, foot-like extensions of the cytoplasm.
Forms of protist motility
Protists use cilia, pseudopods, or flagella to move.
Protists have complex life cycles.
Many have both asexual and sexual reproduction.
An example is a protist called Spirogyra , a type of algae, shown Figure below .
It usually exists as haploid cells that reproduce by binary fission.
In a stressful environment, such as one that is very dry, Spirogyra may produce tough spores that can withstand harsh conditions.
Spores are reproductive cells produced by protists and various other organisms.
