Baking better biscuits
Baking seems easy with all the pre-mixed items available (“just add water and stir”).
But there is a good amount of chemistry involved in baking with ingredients that you measure out.
One important ingredient is baking powder.
The fluffiness in the final product of a non-yeast recipe is usually due to carbon dioxide formed from baking powder.
One popular brand uses a mix of sodium bicarbonate and sodium aluminum sulfate to produce the CO 2 .
The reaction is seen below:
3 \text{NaHCO}_3+\text{NaAl(SO}_4)_2 \rightarrow \text{Al(OH)}_3+2\text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4+3\text{CO}_2
If all goes well, the biscuits rise, the pancakes are fluffy, and everybody is happy.
Hydrolysis of Salts:
Equations
A salt is an ionic compound that is formed when an acid and a base neutralize each other.
While it may seem that salt solutions would always be neutral, they can frequently be either acidic or basic.
Consider the salt formed when the weak acid hydrofluoric acid is neutralized by the strong base sodium hydroxide.
The molecular and net ionic equations are shown below.
& \text{HF}(aq)+\text{NaOH}(aq) \rightarrow \text{NaF}(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \\& \text{HF}(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{F}^-(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
Since sodium fluoride is soluble, the sodium ion is a spectator ion in the neutralization reaction.
The fluoride ion is capable of reacting, to a small extent, with water, accepting a proton.
\text{F}^-(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{HF}(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq)
The fluoride ion is acting as a weak Brønsted-Lowry base.
