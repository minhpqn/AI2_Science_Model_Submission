The simplest cycloalkane is cyclopropane, a three-carbon ring.
Cyclopropane is the simplest alkane
Cyclopropane is the simplest cycloalkane.
Its highly strained geometry makes it rather unstable and highly reactive.
The structural formulas of cyclic hydrocarbons can be represented in multiple ways, two of which are shown above.
Each atom can be shown as in the structure on the left from the  Figure  above .
A convenient shorthand is to omit the element symbols and only show the shape, as in the triangle on the right.
Carbon atoms are understood to be the vertices of the triangle.
The carbon atoms in cycloalkanes are still sp 3 hybridized, with an ideal bond angle of 109.5°.
However, an examination of the cyclopropane structure shows that the triangular structure results in a C-C-C bond angle of 60°.
This deviation from the ideal angle is called ring strain and makes cyclopropane a fairly unstable and reactive molecule.
Ring strain is decreased for cyclobutane, with a bond angle of 90°, but is still significant.
Cyclopentane has a bond angle of about 108°C.
This minimal ring strain for cyclopentane makes it a more stable compound.
Structure of cyclobutane and cyclopentane
Cyclohexane is a six-carbon cycloalkane shown below.
Various representations of the structure of cyclohexane
All three of the depictions of cyclohexane are somewhat misleading because the molecule is not planar.
In order to reduce the ring strain and attain a bond angle of approximately 109.5°, the molecule is puckered.
The puckering of the ring means that every other carbon atom is above and below the plane.
