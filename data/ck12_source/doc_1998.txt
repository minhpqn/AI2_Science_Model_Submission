Roles in an Ecosystem
Define and describe the common roles in an ecosystem.
Can you pick out the organisms at the bottom and at the top of this food chain?
What's at the bottom of the food chain?
A bit of the food energy comes from above, where plankton photosynthesize.
Most comes from the coral.
Coral are animals that live with tiny zooxanthellae that also photosynthesize.
Of course, you know what's at the top of this food chain!
Roles in Ecosystems
All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles.
Some organisms must be producers.
Others must be consumers.
Decomposers are also important.
