Worldwide, there are more deaths linked to air pollution each year than to car accidents.
Research by the WHO also shows that the worst air quality is in countries with high poverty and population rates, such as Egypt, Sudan, Mongolia, and Indonesia.
Respiratory system disorders are directly related to air pollution.
These disorders have severe effects on human health, some leading to death directly related to air pollution.
Air pollution related respiratory disorders include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.
Asthma is a respiratory disorder characterized by wheezing, coughing, and a feeling of constriction in the chest.
Bronchitis is inflammation of the membrane lining of the bronchial tubes of the lungs.
Emphysema is a deadly lung disease characterized by abnormal enlargement of air spaces in the lungs and destruction of the lung tissue.
Additional lung and heart diseases are also related to air pollution, as are respiratory allergies.
Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths.
Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions.
For example, using certain chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause cancer.
Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk.
Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke.
Air Pollution in Cities
Certain respiratory conditions can be made worse in people who live closer to or in large cites.
Some studies have shown that people in urban areas suffer lower levels of lung function and more chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
If you live in a city, you have seen smog .
It is a low-hanging, fog-like cloud that seems to never leave the city ( Figure below ).
Smog is caused by coal burning and by ozone produced by motor vehicle exhaust.
