Near-Earth asteroids have orbits that cross Earth’s orbit.
This means that they can collide with Earth.
There are over 4,500 known near-Earth asteroids.
Small asteroids do sometimes collide with Earth.
An asteroid about 5–10 m in diameter hits about once per year.
Five hundred to a thousand of the known near-Earth asteroids are much bigger.
They are over 1 kilometer in diameter.
When large asteroids hit Earth in the past, many organisms died.
At times, many species became extinct in a mass extinction.
Astronomers keep looking for near-Earth asteroids.
They hope to predict a possible collision early so they can to try to stop it.
Scientists are very interested in asteroids.
Most are composed of material that has not changed since early in the solar system.
Scientists can learn a lot from them about how the solar system formed.
Asteroids may be important for space travel.
They could be mined for rare minerals or for construction projects in space.
Scientists have sent spacecrafts to study asteroids.
In 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker probe orbited the asteroid 433 Eros.
The craft finally landed on its surface in 2001.
The Japanese Hayabusa probe returned to Earth with samples of a small near-Earth asteroid in 2010.
