Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is burned in many home furnaces.
During burning, methane combines with oxygen in the air to produce entirely different chemical substances, including the gases carbon dioxide and water vapor.

Identifying Chemical Changes
Most chemical changes are not as dramatic as exploding fireworks, so how can you tell whether a chemical change has occurred?
There are usually clues.
You just need to know what to look for.
A chemical change has probably occurred if bubbles are released, there is a change of color, or an odor is produced.
Other clues include the release of heat, light, or loud sounds.
Examples of chemical changes that produce these clues are shown in the Figure below .

Q:
In addition to iron rusting, what is another example of matter changing color?
Do you think this color change is a sign that a new chemical substance has been produced?
A:
Another example of matter changing color is a penny changing from reddish brown to greenish brown as it becomes tarnished.
The color change indicates that a new chemical substance has been produced.
Copper on the surface of the penny has combined with oxygen in the air to produce a different substance called copper oxide.
