In fact, there are many more factors than can be dealt with all at once.
Models are necessary in science.
However, you must always remember that a model is a model and not the real thing.
Models are Useful Tools
Scientific models are useful tools for scientists.
Most of Earth's systems are extremely complex.
Models allow scientists to work with systems that are nearly impossible to study as a whole.
Models help scientists to understand these systems.
They can analyze and make predictions about them using the models.
There are different types of models.
Physical models are smaller and simpler representations of the thing being studied.
A globe or a map is a physical model of a portion or all of Earth.
Conceptual models tie together many ideas to explain a phenomenon or event.
Mathematical models are sets of equations that take into account many factors to represent a phenomenon.
Mathematical models are usually done on computers.
Many models are created on computers ( Figure below ).
Only computers can handle and manipulate such enormous amounts of data.
Many scientists now work with climate models.
An unimaginable number of factors affect Earthâ€™s climate.
Many factors are dependent on one another.
