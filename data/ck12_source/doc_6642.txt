Chances are, you will have a hard time thinking of any.
The only truly innate behaviors in humans are called reflex behaviors .
They occur mainly in babies.
Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies may help them survive.
An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex.
Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth.
It is easy to see how this behavior evolved.
It increases the chances of a baby feeding and surviving.
Another example of a reflex behavior in babies is the grasp reflex ( Figure below ).
Babies instinctively grasp an object placed in the palm of their hand.
Their grip may be surprisingly strong.
How do you think this behavior might increase a babyâ€™s chances of surviving?

Innate behavior, or instinct, is any behavior that occurs naturally in all animals of a given species.
Examples of innate behavior include honeybees doing the waggle dance or spiders spinning a web.
