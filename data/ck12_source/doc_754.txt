The units of resistance can be determined using the units of the other terms in the equation, namely that the potential difference is in volts (J/C) and current in amperes (C/s):
R=\frac{\text{volts}}{\text{amperes}}=\frac{\text{joules/coulomb}}{\text{coulombs/second}}=\frac{\text{joules} \cdot \text{seconds}}{\text{coulombs}^2}=ohms
The units for resistance have been given the name ohms and the abbreviation is the Greek letter omega, Ω. 1.00 Ω is the resistance that will allow 1.00 ampere of current to flow through the resistor when the potential difference is 1.00 volt.
Most conductors have a constant resistance regardless of the potential difference; these are said to obey Ohm's Law.
There are two ways to control the current in a circuit.
Since the current is directly proportional to the potential difference and inversely proportional to the resistance, you can increase the current in a circuit by increasing the potential or by decreasing the resistance.
Example Problem:
A 50.0 V battery maintains current through a 20.0 Ω resistor.
What is the current through the resistor?
Solution:
I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{50.0 \ V}{20.0 \ \Omega}=2.50 \ amps
Resistance is the property that determines the amount of current flow through a particular material.
V = IR is known as Ohm’s Law.
