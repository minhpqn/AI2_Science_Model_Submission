The needles used to draw blood for donations are always new.
Therefore, they cannot spread the virus.
Donated blood is also tested to make sure it is does not contain HIV.
HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in the workplace, schools, or social settings.
HIV is not transmitted through shaking hands, hugging, or a casual kiss.
You cannot become infected from a toilet seat, a drinking fountain, a door knob, dishes, drinking glasses, food, or pets.
HIV and the Immune System
How does an HIV infection develop into AIDS?
HIV destroys white blood cells called helper T cells .
The cells are produced by the immune system.
This is the body system that fights infections and other diseases.
HIV invades helper T cells and uses them to produce more virus particles ( Figure below ).
Then, the virus kills the helper T cells.
As the number of viruses in the blood rises, the number of helper T cells falls.
Without helper T cells, the immune system is unable to protect the body.
The infected person cannot fight infections and other diseases because they do not have T cells.
This is why people do not die from HIV.
Instead, they die from another illness, like the common cold, that they cannot fight because they do not have helper T cells.
Medications can slow down the increase of viruses in the blood.
But the medications cannot remove the viruses from the body.
