The changes make the nighttime ionosphere even better at reflecting AM radio waves.
How do you think this might affect the distance AM radio waves travel at night?
A:
With greater reflection off the ionosphere, AM waves can travel even farther at night than they can during the day.
Radio receivers can often pick up radio broadcasts at night from cities that are hundreds of miles away.
Television broadcasts also use radio waves (see Figure above ).
For TV broadcasts, sounds are encoded with frequency modulation, and pictures are encoded with amplitude modulation.
The encoded waves are broadcast from a TV tower.
When the waves are received by television sets, they are decoded and changed back to sounds and pictures.
Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels.
The full range of electromagnetic waves makes up the electromagnetic spectrum.
Radio waves are electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths, lowest frequencies, and least amount of energy.
They are used for radio and television broadcasts and many other purposes.
In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves by changing either the amplitude (AM) or frequency (FM) of the waves.
The encoded waves are broadcast from a tower and changed back to sounds by radio receivers.
In television broadcasts, sounds and pictures are encoded in radio waves, broadcast from a tower, and changed back to sounds and pictures by television sets.
Observe the three radio waves in the animation at the following URL.
Then write a short paragraph comparing and contrasting the three waves.
What are radio waves?
Compare and contrast AM and FM radio broadcasts.
