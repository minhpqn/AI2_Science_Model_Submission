What is happening in the field of chemistry today?
What can I do with a chemistry degree?  All of these are good questions and they should be asked by students interested in chemistry.  Research in chemistry (or any other field, for that matter) is interesting and challenging.  But there are different directions a person can take as they explore research opportunities.
Types of Research
In science, we usually talk about two types of research: pure and applied.  Pure research focuses on answering basic questions such as, "how do gases behave?"  Applied research would be involved in the process of developing a specific preparation for a gas in order for it to be produced and delivered efficiently and economically.
This division sounds like it would be easy to make, but sometimes we cannot draw a clear line between what is “pure” and what is “applied.”
Examples of “Pure” Research
A lot of “pure” research is of the “what is this?” or “how does it work?” variety.
The early history of chemistry contains many examples.
The ancient Greek philosophers debated the composition of matter (earth? air? fire? water? all of the above?).
They weren’t going to do anything with their knowledge – they just wanted to know.

Studies on the elements (especially after Mendeleev’s periodic table was published) were primarily “pure” research types of experiments.
Does this element exist?
What are its properties?
The scientists did not have any practical application in mind, but were curious about the world around them.
Examples of “Applied” Research
There is a great deal of “applied” research taking place today.
In general, no new science principles are discovered, but existing knowledge is used to develop a new product.
Research on laundry detergents will probably not give us any new concepts about soap, but will help us develop materials that get our clothes cleaner, use less water, and create lower amounts of pollution.
