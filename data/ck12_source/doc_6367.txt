Calculating Free Energy Change (ΔG°)
Perform free energy calculations using enthalpy, entropy, and temperature values.
The ingredients in a cake must be heated to create an edible product
Time for dessert!
When you are baking something, you heat the oven to the temperature indicated in the recipe.
Then you mix all the ingredients, put them in the proper baking dish, and place them in the oven for a specified amount of time.
If you had mixed the ingredients and left them out at room temperature, not much would change.
The materials need to be heated to a given temperature for a set time in order for the ingredients to react with one another and produce a delicious final product.
Calculating Free Energy  (\Delta G^\circ)
The free energy change of a reaction can be calculated using the following expression:
\Delta G^\circ=\Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ
where  \Delta G = \text{free energy change (kJ/mol)}
\Delta H = \text{change in enthalpy (kJ/mol)}
