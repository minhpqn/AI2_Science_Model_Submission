The lengths of the sides of a cube are doubling each second.
At what rate is the volume increasing?
Solution :
The cube side length, x , is doubling every second.
Therefore after 1 second it becomes 2{x} .
The volume of the first cube of side {x} is {x}\times{x}\times{x}={{x}^3} .
The volume of the second cube of side 2{x} is 2{x}\times2{x}\times2{x}={8{x}^3} .
The ratio of the second volume to the first volume is {8{x}^3}/{{x}^3}=8 .
Thus the volume is increasing by a factor of 8 every second.

A tortoise travels 15 meters \;\mathrm{(m)} west, then another 13 centimeters \;\mathrm{(cm)} west.
How many meters total has she walked?
A tortoise, Bernard, starting at point A travels 12 \;\mathrm{m} west and then 150 millimeters \;\mathrm{(mm)} east.
How far west of point A is Bernard after completing these two motions?
80 \;\mathrm{m} + 145 \;\mathrm{cm} + 7850 \;\mathrm{mm} = X\ \;\mathrm{mm} .
What is  X  ?
A square has sides of length 45 \;\mathrm{mm} .
What is the area of the square in \;\mathrm{mm}^2 ?
A square with area 49 \;\mathrm{cm}^2 is stretched so that each side is now twice as long.
