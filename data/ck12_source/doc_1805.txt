What climate types cause less intense weathering?
How do plants increase both types of weathering?
How does bauxite form?
What resource comes from bauxite?
Describe the characteristics of soil.
How does soil resemble weathered rock?
The same processes that weather rock create soil.
A large part of soil is weathered rock!
If weathering processes didn't exist on earth we would have no soil.
Earth wouldn't be a very good place to live.
There would be very limited plant life and not much way to grow crops.
The Importance of Soil
You learned in the previous concept that weathering produces sediment.
Weathering also produces soil.
People could not live on earth without soil!
Your life and the lives of many land organisms depend on soil.
Soil is only a very thin layer over solid rock.
Yet, it is the place where reactions between solid rock, liquid water and air take place.
Soil anchors plant roots and provides them with water and nutrients.
We get wood, paper, cotton, medicines, and even pure water from soil.
