They can burn the skin but not penetrate it.
Beta particles can travel up to a meter through air.
They can penetrate and damage skin.
Gamma rays can travel thousands of meters through air.
They can penetrate and damage cells deep inside the body.
Radioactive decay is the process in which unstable nuclei of radioactive atoms become stable by emitting charged particles and energy.
There are three types of radioactive decay: alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay.
Alpha and beta decay change one element into another.
Gamma decay does not.
Radioactive decay can damage living things.
Alpha decay is the least damaging, and gamma decay is the most damaging.
