Does that mean that the world is not overpopulated?
Is space all that people need?

With ample food, better health, and easier work, people live longer.
Children are much more likely to reach adulthood and have their own children.
In many countries, death rates have gone down dramatically, but birth rates remain high.
This means that the population is growing.
Pictured below is the growth rates of human populations all over the world ( Figure below ).

World population growth rates.
Is the population growing faster in the wealthiest countries or the poorest countries?
Human ingenuity has allowed the population to continue to grow.
Weâ€™ve increased Earth's carrying capacity for humans by our genius.
We grow crops, trade for needed materials, and design ways to exploit resources that are difficult to get at, such as groundwater.
We use long-buried ancient organisms for fuel.
We have broken the rules for biological populations.
Of course, there's a flip side to this.
For the population to continue to grow, more advances in agriculture will be needed.
The best lands are already in use.
