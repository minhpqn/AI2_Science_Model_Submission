Two cars are drag racing down El Camino.
At time t = 0 , the yellow Maserati starts from rest and accelerates at 10 \ m/s^2 .
As it starts to move it’s passed by a ’63 Chevy Nova (cherry red) traveling at a constant velocity of 30 m/s. a.
On the axes below, show a line for each car representing its speed as a function of time.
Label each line. b.
At what time will the two cars have the same speed (use your graph)? {\;} c.
On the axes below, draw a line (or curve) for each car representing its position as a function of time.
Label each curve. d.
At what time would the two cars meet (other than at the start)? {\;}
1c. 25 m
1d. -5 m

Solve all types of problems using the kinematic equations.
In this Concept, you will learn how to solve all types of problems using the kinematic equations.
v_{avg} & = \frac{\boldsymbol{\Delta} x}{\Delta t} \\\a_{avg} & = \frac{\boldsymbol{\Delta} v}{\Delta t}
The Big Three
x(t) & = x_0 +v_0 t + \tfrac{1}{2} a t^2 \\\v(t) & = v_0 +at \\\{v_f}^2 & = {v_0}^2 + 2a \Delta x
