Cell Division - Advanced
What do you think this colorful picture shows?
If you guessed that itâ€™s a picture of a cell undergoing cell division, you are right.
In fact, the picture is an image of a lung cell stained with fluorescent dyes undergoing mitosis, specifically during early anaphase.
You will read about mitosis, a type of cell division, in these concepts.
The separating chromosomes and the spindles are visible in this photo.
Cell division is just one of the stages that all cells go through during their life.
This includes cells that are harmful, such as cancer cells.
Cancer cells divide more often than normal cells, and grow out of control.
In fact, this is how cancer cells cause illness.
In these concepts, you will read about how cells divide, what other stages cells go through, and what causes cancer cells to divide out of control and harm the body.
Cell Division - Advanced
Define cell division.
Where do cells come from?
No matter what the cell, all cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division.
This is one of the core concepts of the Cell Theory.
The cell may be the simplest bacterium or a complex muscle, bone, or blood cell.
The cell may comprise the whole organism, or be just one cell of trillions.
But whatever type of cell it is, it comes from a preexisting cell.
And the new cell is genetically identical to its parent cell - that is, it has exactly the same DNA.
