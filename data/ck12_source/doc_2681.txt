Recognizing Chemical Reactions
Identify potential signs that a chemical reaction has occurred.
Look at the girl’s hair in the photo above.
It has obviously changed color.
The process in which this occurred involved chemical reactions.
How do you know that chemical reactions have occurred?
The change in color is the most obvious clue.
What’s Your Sign?
A change in color is just one of several potential signs that a chemical reaction has occurred.
Other potential signs include:
Change in temperature-Heat is released or absorbed during the reaction.
Production of a gas-Gas bubbles are released during the reaction.
