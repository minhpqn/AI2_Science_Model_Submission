The Male Reproductive System Functions
Dogs have puppies.
Cats have kittens.
All organisms reproduce, obviously including humans.
Like other mammals, humans have a body system that controls reproduction.
It is called the reproductive system .
It is the only human body system that is very different in males and females.
The male and female reproductive systems have different organs and different functions.
The male reproductive system has two main functions:
Releasing testosterone into the body.
Sperm are male gametes , or reproductive cells.
When a male gamete meets a female gamete, they can form a new organism.
Sperm form when certain cells in the male reproductive system divide by meiosis , resulting in cells with half the amount of DNA as a regular "body" cell.
More precisely, sperm cells are haploid sex cells, having one set of chromosomes.
Regular body cells are diploid, having two set of chromosomes.
As there are 46 chromosomes in a diploid human cell, how many are in a human sperm cell?
When males grow older, they produce millions of sperm each day.
The male reproductive system also maintains and transports and delivers sperm and a protective fluid, known as semen.
Testosterone is the main sex hormone in males.
Hormones are chemicals that control many body processes.
