Explain the rate of evolution.
Describe an evolutionary tree.
Can you watch evolution happening?

Human evolution took millions of years.
However, sometimes evolution can also happen quite quickly.
How fast is evolution?
Can you actually see evolution happening within your lifetime?
Usually evolution takes a long time.
So how can we visualize how it has happened?
Rates of Evolution
How long did it take for the giraffe to develop a long neck?
How long did it take for the Gal√°pagos finches to evolve?
How long did it take for whales to evolve from land mammals?
These, and other questions about the rate of evolution, are difficult to answer.
