There are about 4 to 6 million RBCs per cubic millimeter of blood.
Each RBC has about 200 million molecules of hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen.
Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells their red color.
Red blood cells ( Figure below ) are made in the red marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and vertebrae.
Each red blood cell lives for only 120 days (about four months).
After this time, they are destroyed in the liver and spleen.
Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus or other organelles.
Lacking these components allows the cells to have more hemoglobin and carry more oxygen.
The flattened biconcave shape of red blood cells helps them carry more oxygen
The flattened shape of red blood cells helps them carry more oxygen than if they were rounded.
White Blood Cells
White blood cells (WBCs) are usually larger than red blood cells.
They do not have hemoglobin and do not carry oxygen.
White blood cells make up less than one percent of the blood's volume.
Most WBCs are made in the bone marrow, and some mature in the lymphatic system.
There are different WBCs with different jobs.
WBCs defend the body against infection by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens .
WBCs do have a nucleus and other organelles.
Neutrophils are WBCs that can squeeze through capillary walls and swallow particles such as bacteria and parasites.
