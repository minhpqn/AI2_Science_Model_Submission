Define conjugate acid.
Define conjugate base.
Write reactions that illustrate the idea of conjugate acid-base pairs.
Acid base reactions occur in both directions
The Roman god Janus was considered the god of gates and doors, beginnings and endings.
He is portrayed with two faces, looking in two directions at once.
Janus would have been in a good position to look at the acid-base reactions we see in this concept, since they are equilibrium reactions involving two different forms of both acids and bases.
