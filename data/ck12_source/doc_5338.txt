This process begins with the information in a gene being transcribed into an RNA molecule, a process called transcription.
Gene Expression.
Shown is the process beginning with the DNA molecule in the nucleus and ending with the protein in the cytoplasm.
Transcription produces the mRNA molecule, which carries the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
gene :
A segment of DNA that contains the information necessary to encode an RNA molecule or a protein.
gene expression :
The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.
protein synthesis :
The process in which cells make proteins; includes transcription of DNA and translation of mRNA.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) :
Single-stranded nucleic acid; involved in protein synthesis.
transcription :
The process of making mRNA from the information in the DNA (gene) sequence.
RNA is the middle player in the central dogma of molecular biology.
RNA carries the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
