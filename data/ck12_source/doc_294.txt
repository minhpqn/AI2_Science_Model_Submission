Potential and kinetic energy practice problems with solutions:
A 90.0 kg man climbs hand over hand up a rope to a height of 9.47 m.  How much potential energy does he have at the top?
A 50.0 kg shell was fired from a cannon at earthâ€™s surface to a maximum height of 400. m.
What is the potential energy at maximum height?
It then fell to a height of 100. m.
What was the loss of PE as it fell?
A person weighing 645 N climbs up a ladder to a height of 4.55 m.
What work does the person do?
What is the increase in gravitational potential energy?
Where does the energy come from to cause this increase in PE
potential energy:
Otherwise known as stored energy, is the ability of a system to do work due to its position or internal structure.
For example, gravitational potential energy is a stored energy determined by an object's position in a gravitational field while elastic potential energy is the energy stored in a spring.
Conservation of Energy
State the law of conservation of energy.
Describe a closed system.
Use the law of conservation of energy to solve problems.
Energy is conserved during a roller coaster ride
There are many energy conversions between potential and kinetic energy as the cars travel around this double looping roller coaster.
Throughout the ride, however, there will always be the same total amount of energy.
