Extending from the upper corners of the uterus are the two fallopian tubes .
Each tube reaches (but is not attached to) one of the ovaries.
The ovary end of the tube has a fringelike structure that moves in waves.
The motion sweeps eggs from the ovary into the tube.
The breasts are not directly involved in reproduction, but they nourish a baby after birth.
Each breast contains mammary glands , which secrete milk.
The milk drains into ducts leading to the nipple.
A suckling baby squeezes the milk out of the ducts and through the nipple.
The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce eggs and secrete female sex hormones.
They also provide a site for fertilization and enable the development and birth of a fetus.
Female reproductive structures include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
