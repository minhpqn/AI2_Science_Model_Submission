alcoholic fermentation :
The process for making ATP in the absence of oxygen; converts glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
ethanol fermentation :
The process for making ATP in the absence of oxygen; converts glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
fermentation :
Type of anaerobic respiration that includes glycolysis followed by the conversion of pyruvic acid to one or more other compounds and the formation of NAD + ; the process of producing ATP in the absence of oxygen through glycolysis.
yeast :
Eukaryotic single-celled microorganisms classified in the kingdom Fungi.
Both alcoholic and lactic acid fermentation pathways change pyruvate in order to continue producing ATP by glycolysis.
Alcoholic fermentation is a type of anaerobic respiration that includes glycolysis followed by the conversion of pyruvic acid to ethanol and carbon dioxide and the regeneration of NAD + from NADH.
