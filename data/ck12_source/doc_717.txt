One of these red lines is one-half wavelength longer than the other, causing the two waves to hit the wall out of phase  and undergo destructive interference.
A dark bank appears at this position.
Diagram of single slit interference
Just as in double slit interference, a pair of similar triangles can be constructed in the interference pattern.
The pertinent values from these triangles are the width of the slit, w , the wavelength, Î», the distance from the central bright spot to the first dark band, x , and the distance from the center of the slit to back wall, L .
The relationship of these four values is
\frac{\lambda}{w}=\frac{x}{L} \ or \ \lambda=\frac{wx}{L} .
Triangle formed in single slit interference
Example Problem:
Monochromatic light of wavelength 605 nm falls on a slit of width 0.095 mm.
The slit is located 85 cm from a screen.
How far is the center of the central bright band to the first dark band?
Solution: x=\frac{\lambda L}{w}=\frac{(6.05 \times 10^{-7} \ m)(0.85 \ m)}{(9.5 \times 10^{-5} \ m)}=0.0054 \ m
Interference patterns can also be produced by single slits.
In the case of a single slit, the particles of medium at both corners of the slit act as point sources, and produce circular waves from both edges.
The wavelength can be determined by this equation: \frac{\lambda}{w}=\frac{x}{L} \ or \ \lambda=\frac{wx}{L} .

The interference pattern appears as the slit becomes ___________ (wider, thinner).
The same set up is used for two different single slit diffraction experiments.
