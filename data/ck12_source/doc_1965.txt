Variation and Adaptation
Every organism is different from every other organism.
Every organism's genes are different, too.
There are variations in the traits of a population.
For example, there are lots of variations in the color of human hair.
Hair can be blonde, brown, black, or even red.
Hair color is a trait determined by genes.
At some time in the past, a variation probably came from a mutation.
A mutation is a random change in an organism's genes ( Figure below ).
Mutations are natural.
Some are harmful, but many are neutral.
If a mutation is harmful, the organism may not live to reproduce.
If the mutation is beneficial, that organism may have a better chance to survive.
An organism that survives is likely to have offspring.
If it does, it may pass the mutation on to its offspring.
The offspring may be more likely to survive.
An explanation of how adaptations develop
Genetic mutation is central to the creation of biological diversity.
Some of the characteristics an organism has may help it survive.
These characteristics are called adaptations .
