Hair, hair follicle, and oil glands.
The oil, called sebum, helps to prevent water loss from the skin.
The sebaceous gland secretes sebum, which waterproofs the skin and hair.
In humans, hair grows everywhere on the body except the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands, the lips, and the eyelids (except for eyelashes).
Hair grows at a rate of about half an inch (1.25 cm) each month, or about 6 inches (15 cm) a year.
Hair, especially on the head, helps to keep the body warm.
The air traps a layer of warm air near the skin and acts like a warm blanket.
Hair can also act as a filter.
Nose hair helps to trap particles in the air that may otherwise travel to the lungs.
Eyelashes shield eyes from dust and sunlight.
Eyebrows stop salty sweat and rain from flowing into the eye.
