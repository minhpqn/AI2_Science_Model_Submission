Be tested using experiments to collect evidence.
Be proven wrong.
Provide measurable results.
Provide yes or no answers.
For example, do you think the following hypothesis meets the four criteria above?
Let's see.
Hypothesis: "The number of deformed frogs in five ponds that are polluted with chemical X is higher than the number of deformed frogs in five ponds without chemical X." Of course, next you will have to test your hypothesis.
Test Your Hypothesis
To test the hypothesis, an experiment will be done.
You would count the healthy and deformed frogs and measure the amount of chemical X in all of the ponds.
The hypothesis will be either true or false.
Doing an experiment will test most hypotheses.
The experiment may generate evidence in support of the hypothesis.
The experiment may also generate evidence proving the hypothesis false.
Once you collect your data, it will need to be analyzed.
Analyze Data and Draw a Conclusion
If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the experiment will produce results that you can measure, collect, and analyze.
The analysis should tell you if the hypothesis is true or false.
Refer to the table for the experimental results ( Table below ).
