Drip irrigation ( Figure below ) wastes a lot less.
Water pipes run over the surface of the ground.
Tiny holes in the pipes are placed close to each plant.
Water slowly drips out of the holes and soaks into the soil around the plants.
Very little of the water evaporates or runs off the ground.
Drip irrigation helps save water
The above is a drip irrigation system.
Look at the soil in the photo.
It’s damp around each plant but dry everywhere else.
Some communities save water with rationing.
Much rationing takes place only during times of drought.
During rationing, water may not be used for certain things.
For example, communities may ban lawn watering and car washing.
People may be fined if they use water in these ways.
You can do your part.
Follow any bans where you live.
Saving Water at Home
It’s easy to save water at home.
If you save even a few gallons a day you can make a big difference in the long run.
The best place to start saving water is in the bathroom.
