A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders, one inside the other.
Both rings or cylinders turn in the same direction around a single center point.
The inner ring or cylinder is called the axle, and the outer one is called the wheel.
Besides the Ferris wheel, the doorknob in the Figure below is another example of a wheel and axle.
