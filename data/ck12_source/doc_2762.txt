A:
The saturated fatty acid molecule has 12 hydrogen atoms.
This is as many hydrogen atoms as can possibly be bonded to carbon atoms in this molecule.
The unsaturated fatty acid molecule has 10 hydrogen atoms, or two less than the maximum possible number.
The saturated fatty acid has only single bonds between its carbon atoms.
The unsaturated fatty acid has a double bond between two of its carbon atoms.
Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
These lipids are called phospholipids.
Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things.
In the Figure below , you can see how phospholipid molecules are arranged in a cell membrane.
One end of each phospholipid molecule is polar, so it has a partial electric charge.
Water is also polar and has electrically charged ends, so it is attracted to the oppositely charged end of a phospholipid molecule.
This end of the phospholipid molecule is described as hydrophilic, which means “water loving.”
The other end of each phospholipid molecule is nonpolar and has no electric charge.
This end of the phospholipid molecule repels polar water and is described as hydrophobic, or “water hating.”
Phospholipids in a membrane
In the Figure above , the hydrophilic ends of the phospholipid molecules are on the outsides of the cell membrane, and the hydrophobic ends are on the inside of the cell membrane.
This arrangement of phospholipids allows some substances to pass through the cell membrane while keeping other substances out.

Lipids are a class of biochemical compounds that living things use to store energy.
