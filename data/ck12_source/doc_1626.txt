Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own “food” from the sun's energy, carbon dioxide, and water.
During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water combine with solar energy to create glucose , a carbohydrate (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), and oxygen.
The process can be summarized as: in the presence of sunlight, carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen.
Glucose, the main product of photosynthesis, is a sugar that acts as the "food" source for plants.
The glucose is then converted into usable chemical energy, ATP , during cellular respiration .
The oxygen formed during photosynthesis, which is necessary for animal life, is essentially a waste product of the photosynthesis process.
Actually, almost all organisms obtain their energy from photosynthetic organisms.
For example, if a bird eats a caterpillar, then the bird gets the energy that the caterpillar gets from the plants it eats.
So the bird indirectly gets energy that began with the glucose formed through photosynthesis.
Therefore, the process of photosynthesis is central to sustaining life on Earth.
In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts .
Only cells with chloroplasts—plant cells and algal (protist) cells—can perform photosynthesis.
Animal cells and fungal cells do not have chloroplasts and, therefore, cannot photosynthesize.
That is why these organisms, as well as the non-photosynthetic protists, rely on other organisms to obtain their energy.
These organisms are heterotrophs.
