What is their function?
Distinguish between B and T lymphocytes.
B and T Cell Response
Distinguish B cells from T cells.
Define antibody and antigen.
Explain how B cells and T cells respond to pathogens.
Summarize the roles of killer T cells and helper T cells.
What happens when your body recognizes an invader?
When your immune system detects an invading pathogen, it goes on the attack!
Notice how this T-cell is setting out to destroy a cancer cell.
B and T Cell Response
Some defenses, like your skin and mucous membranes, are not designed to ward off a specific pathogen.
They are just general defenders against disease.
Your body also has defenses that are more specialized.
Through the help of your immune system, your body can generate an army of cells to kill that one specific pathogen.
There are two different types of specific immune responses.
One type involves B cells.
The other type involves T cells.
Recall that B cells and T cells are types of white blood cells that are key in the immune response.
Whereas the immune system's first and second line of defense are more generalized or non-specific, the immune response is specific.
