This distinctive green compound is also called patina and prevents the copper underneath from further corrosion (see Statue of Liberty in the Figure below ).
The Statue of Liberty is protected from further corrosion by a layer of patina

Conversely, the iron oxides that form during the corrosion of iron form a surface that flakes off easily rather than remaining tight to the surface.
This allows the iron to corrode completely through until the iron object is destroyed.
One way to prevent corrosion is to protect the surface of the metal.
Covering the surface of the metal object with paint or oil will prevent corrosion by not allowing oxygen to contact it.
Unfortunately, scratches in the paint or wearing off of the oil will allow the corrosion to begin.
Corrosion-sensitive metals can also be coated with another metal that is resistant to corrosion.
A “tin can” is actually made of iron coated with a thin layer of tin which protects the iron.
Corrosion can also be controlled by connecting the object to be protected to another object made of a metal that is corroded even more easily.
When an iron nail is wrapped with a strip of zinc and exposed to water, the zinc (being a more active metal than iron) is oxidized while the iron remains intact.
This technique, called cathodic protection, is commonly used to prevent the hulls of steel ships from rusting.
Blocks of zinc are attached to the underside of the hull (see Figure below ).
The zinc blocks preferentially corrode, keeping the hull intact.
The zinc blocks must be periodically replaced to maintain the protection of the iron.
