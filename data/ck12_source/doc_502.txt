The nervous system controls sensing, feeling, and thinking.
It also controls movement and just about every other body function.
That’s why problems with the nervous system can affect the entire body.
Diseases of the nervous system include brain and spinal cord infections.
Other problems of the nervous system range from very serious diseases, such as tumors, to less serious problems, such as tension headaches.
Some of these diseases are present at birth.
Others begin during childhood or adulthood.
Central Nervous System Infections
When you think of infections, you probably think of an ear infection or strep throat.
You probably don’t think of a brain or spinal cord infection.
But bacteria and viruses can infect these organs as well as other parts of the body.
Infections of the brain and spinal cord are not very common.
But when they happen, they can be very serious.
That’s why it’s important to know their symptoms.
Encephalitis is a brain infection ( Figure below ).
If you have encephalitis, you are likely to have a fever and headache or feel drowsy and confused.
The disease is most often caused by viruses.
The immune system tries to fight off a brain infection, just as it tries to fight off other infections.
But sometimes this can do more harm than good.
The immune system’s response may cause swelling in the brain.
