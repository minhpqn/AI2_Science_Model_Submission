HIV and AIDS
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the immune system .
An example of HIV is shown in Figure below .
Many people infected with HIV eventually develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
This may not occur until many years after the virus first enters the body.
HIV is a virus that attacks cells of the immune system.
HIV is transmitted, or spread, through direct contact of mucous membranes or body fluids such as blood, semen, or breast milk.
As shown in Figure below , transmission of the virus can occur through sexual contact or the use of contaminated hypodermic needles.
It can also be transmitted through an infected mother’s blood to her baby during late pregnancy or birth or through breast milk after birth.
In the past, HIV was also transmitted through blood transfusions.
Because donated blood is now screened for HIV, the virus is no longer transmitted this way.
HIV is not spread through saliva, touching or in swimming pools.
