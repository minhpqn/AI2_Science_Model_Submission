There are actually five classes of marine chordates (for example, sharks are cartilaginous fish which are distinct from bony fish), and these will be discussed in additional concepts.
The chordate phylum is broken down into three subphyla:
Urochordata:
The tunicates, pictured in the introduction, make up this group.
The urochordates are sessile (non-moving) marine animals with sack-like bodies and tubes for water movement.
Urochordates have a notochord and nerve cord only during the larval stage.
Cephalochordata:
Cephalochordates include the lancelets ( Figure below ), fish-like marine animals often found half-buried in the sand.
Cephalochordates have a notochord and nerve cord but no backbone.
Vertebrata:
Humans and other mammals, along with fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, fall in this category.
In vertebrates, the notochord is typically smaller and surrounded by a backbone.

Chordates are animals that have a notochord, post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.
Chordates include all vertebrates and some invertebrates.
Use the resource below to answer the questions that follow.
( Note : this resource refers to human embryos as having gill slits.
This is a commonly held misconception which seems to have originated in a now defunct theory by Ernst Haeckel.
In the embryonic development of chordates, there is a stage where an invagination, called "gill pouches" or "pharyngeal pouches," appear in vertebrate embryos.
