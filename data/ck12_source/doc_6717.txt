But if we accelerate the leftmost block to the right, this will create a normal force between the little block and the big block, and if there is a coefficient of friction between them, then the little block wonâ€™t slide down!
Clever, eh?
The mass of the little block is 0.15 \;\mathrm{kg} .
What frictional force is required to keep it from falling? (State a magnitude and direction.)
If both blocks are accelerating to the right with an acceleration a = 14.0 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2 , what is the normal force on the little block provided by the big block?
What is the minimum coefficient of static friction required?
b.
F_x = 87 \ N, F_y = 50 \ N c.
N = 750 \ N d. f = 60 \ N e. 0.34 \ m/s^2
a. 1.5 \;\mathrm{N}; 2.1 \;\mathrm{N}; 0.71
Pressure and Force
Explain the difference between pressure and force.
Calculate the pressure in a variety of problems.
Students will learn the difference between pressure and force and how to calculate the pressure in a variety of problems
P = \frac{F}{A} ;
Pressure is a force exerted over some area
Guidance Pressure is often confused with force.
Pressure is force spread out over an area; a small force exerted on a very small area can create a very large pressure; i.e., poke a pin into your arm!
How much pressure does a 340-g Coke can exert on a table if the diameter of the can is 8.0 cm?
