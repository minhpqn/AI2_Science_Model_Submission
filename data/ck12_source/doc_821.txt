These relationships are often necessary for the survival of one or both organisms.
There are three types of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, communalism, and parasitism.
Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit.
Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other is not affected.
Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic species benefits while the host species is harmed.
An example of a mutualistic relationship is between herbivores (plant-eaters) and the bacteria that live in their intestines.
The bacteria get a place to live.
Meanwhile, the bacteria help the herbivore digest food.
Both species benefit, so this is a mutualistic relationship.
The clownfish and the sea anemones also have a mutualistic relationship.
The clownfish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from predators ( Figure below ).
Another example of this type of symbiotic relationship is the relationship between the plover bird and the African crocodile.
The tiny blackbird acts as a toothpick for the fierce crocodile, and helps by removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodile's teeth.
These food remains are the source of food for the bird.
Another example is between the ostrich and the zebra.
The ostrich always moves with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell, whereas the zebra has very sharp senses.
The ostrich has a keen sense of sight, which the zebra lacks.
Hence, these two species depend on each other to warn one another of any nearby imposing dangers.
Commensal relationships may involve an organism using another for transportation or housing.
For example, spiders build their webs on trees.
