The water supply can be harmed in two major ways.
The water can be polluted, and it can be overused.
Protecting the water supply must address both problems.
We need to reduce how much pollution ends up in the water supply—keeping water from being polluted is easier and cheaper than cleaning it.
We need to treat water that’s already polluted.
We need to conserve water by using less.
Controlling Water Pollution
Disasters, such as rivers burning, led to new U.S. laws to protect the water.
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established, and the Clean Water Act was passed.
Now, water is routinely tested.
Pollution is tracked to its source, and polluters are forced to fix the problem and clean up the pollution.
They are also fined.
These consequences have led industries, agriculture, and communities to pollute the water much less than before.
The Clean Water Act
Keeping water clean often requires laws.
Laws ensure that people behave responsibly.
The Clean Water Act regulates water pollution in the U.S.
The law allows the EPA to set standards for water quality.
The EPA regulates the pollutants that can enter waterways.
The agency can provide money for wastewater treatment plants.
