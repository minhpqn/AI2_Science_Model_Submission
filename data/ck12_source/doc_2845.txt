Why would you not use carbon-14 to measure the age of the rock?
What is radioactive dating?
Which radioisotope in the Table above could you use to date a fossil thought to be about 500 million years old?
Explain your choice.
Why does the amount of carbon-14 in an organism remain the same throughout the organism’s life?
Why does the amount change after the organism dies?
Outline what happens during nuclear fission.
Describe a nuclear chain reaction.
Explain how nuclear fission can be used to produce energy.
List pros and cons of using nuclear energy.
Steam rises from the cooling towers of this nuclear power plant.
The steam is only harmless water vapor.
Unlike a power plant that burns fossil fuel, a nuclear power plant doesn’t release pollution into the air.
That’s because a nuclear power plant produces power by nuclear fission, a type of nuclear reaction.
What Is Nuclear Fission?
Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of a radioactive atom into two smaller nuclei.
This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter.
Fission of a tiny pellet of radioactive uranium-235, like the one pictured in the Figure below , releases as much energy as burning 1,000 kilograms of coal!
