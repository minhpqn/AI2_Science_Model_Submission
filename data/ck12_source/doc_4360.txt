You can compare their ray fins with the fleshy fins of lobe-finned fish in Figure below .
Fins of bony fish
Fins of Bony Fish.
The fins of ray-finned and lobe-finned fish are quite different.
How is the form of the fins related to their different functions in the two classes of fish?
Ray Fin (left), Lobe Fin (right)
Lobe-finned fish are currently far fewer in number than ray-finned fish.
Their fins, like the one shown in Figure above , contain a stump-like appendage of bone and muscle.
There are two groups of lobe-finned fish still alive today: coelacanths and lungfish.
Coelacanths are ancient fish with just two living species.
They are at risk of extinction because of their very small numbers.
Lungfish have a lung-like organ for breathing air.
The organ is an adaptation of the swim bladder.
It allows them to survive for long periods out of water.
There are about 28,000 existing species of fish, and they are placed in five classes: hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned bony fish, and lobe-finned bony fish.
