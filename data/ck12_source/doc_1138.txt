The Coriolis effect bends the direction of surface currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere.
The currents curve left in the Southern Hemisphere ( Figure below ).
The Coriolis effect causes winds and currents to form circular patterns
The Coriolis effect causes winds and currents to form circular patterns.
The direction that they spin depends on the hemisphere that they are in.
Earth rotates beneath freely moving objects like water and air.
Compared with a spot on the planet, the objects appear to be moving.
Freely moving objects appear to move right in the Northern Hemisphere.
They appear to move left in the Southern Hemisphere.
Coriolis is an effect rather than a force.
Coriolis does not force a motion.
An object appears to have a change of motion due to the Coriolis effect.
