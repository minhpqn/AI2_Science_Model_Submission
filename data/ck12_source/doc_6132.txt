Surface tension can be seen by the curved meniscus that forms when water is in a thin column such as a graduated cylinder or a buret.
Water forms a meniscus because of the surface tension generated by water's hydrogen bonding
The meniscus of water in a graduated cylinder forms because of waterâ€™s hydrogen bonding.
The vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure of the vapor produced by evaporation of a liquid or solid above the liquid or solid in a closed container.
The hydrogen bonding between liquid water molecules explains why water has an unusually low vapor pressure.  Relatively few molecules of water are capable of escaping the surface of the liquid and enter the vapor phase.  Evaporation is slow and thus the vapor exerts a low pressure in a closed container.  Low vapor pressure is an important physical property of water, since lakes, oceans, and other large bodies of water would all tend to evaporate much more quickly otherwise.
Vapor pressure is influenced by temperature.
As the temperature increases, more molecules are released from the surface of the liquid.  This increases movement above the liquid surface, increasing the pressure in the vapor stage.  The image below illustrates the effect of temperature on vapor pressure.
As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases as well
Water has high surface tension because of extensive hydrogen bonding.
The vapor pressure of water is low due to hydrogen bonding.
Vapor pressure increases as temperature increases.
