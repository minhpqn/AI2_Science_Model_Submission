Organisms are individual living things.
Despite their tremendous diversity, all organisms have the same basic needs: energy and matter.
These must be obtained from the environment.
Therefore, organisms are not closed systems.
They depend on and are influenced by their environment.
The environment includes two types of factors: abiotic and biotic.
Abiotic factors are the nonliving aspects of the environment.
They include factors such as sunlight, soil, temperature, and water.
Biotic factors are the living aspects of the environment.
They consist of other organisms, including members of the same and different species.
An ecosystem is a unit of nature and the focus of study in ecology.
It consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions.
Ecosystems can vary in size.
A lake could be considered an ecosystem.
So could a dead log on a forest floor.
Both the lake and log contain a variety of species that interact with each other and with abiotic factors.
Another example of an ecosystem is pictured in Figure below .
An example of a desert ecosystem
A desert ecosystem.
What are some of the biotic and abiotic factors in this desert ecosystem?
