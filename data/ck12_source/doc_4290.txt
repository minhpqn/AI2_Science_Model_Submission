Fertilization takes place inside the female organism.
Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day!
The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults.
Then the cycle repeats.
Ecology of Roundworms
Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic.
Free-living worms are found mainly in freshwater habitats.
Some live in soil.
They generally feed on bacteria, fungi, protozoans, or decaying organic matter.
By breaking down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle.
Parasitic roundworms may have plant, vertebrate, or invertebrate hosts.
Several species have human hosts.
For example, hookworms, like the one in Figure below , are human parasites.
They infect the human intestine.
They are named for the hooks they use to grab onto the hostâ€™s tissues.
Hookworm larvae enter the host through the skin.
They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults.
Adults lay eggs, which pass out of the host in feces.
Then the cycle repeats.
