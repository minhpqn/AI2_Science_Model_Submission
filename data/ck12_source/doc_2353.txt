Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the object.
An example of a variable relating to the ramp is its steepness.
An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it moves—it might roll or slide down the ramp.
Either of these variables could be manipulated by the researcher, so you could choose one of them for your manipulated variable.
Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment.
You choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable.
You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the bottom of the ramp.
You decide to test two blocks on two ramps, one steeper than the other, and see which block reaches the bottom first.
You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a rough board for the other ramp.
You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope (see sketch below).
You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner.
You’re surprised, because you expected the block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom first.
Q:
What explains your result?
A:
The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom sooner if all else was equal.
The problem is that all else was not equal.
The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness.
The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp, even though the rougher ramp was steeper.
This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments: experimental controls.
