However, in some cases, your predictions will not succeed (changing the light bulb does not fix the problem), and you will have to start over again with a new hypothesis.
Perhaps there is a short circuit somewhere in the house, or the power might be out.
The general process of a scientific investigation is summed up in Figure below .
A simple summary of the steps of a scientific investigation
The general pathway of a scientific investigation.
A scientific investigation typically has these steps, though the pathway is often modified for a specific scientific investigation.
A broader summary of how scientific investigations move from observation of a phenomena to a theory
The general process of scientific investigations.
This diagram illustrates how scientific investigations move from observation of phenomenon to a theory.
The progress is not as straightforward as it looks in this diagram.
Many times the hypothesis is falsified, which means the investigator will have to redevelop/revise a hypothesis.
The process of scientific investigation.
The act of noting or detecting phenomenon by the senses.
For example, taking measurements is a form of observation.
A suggested explanation based on evidence that can be tested by observation or experimentation.
The process of looking for scientific reasons for observations.
A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already known.
An explanation that is ruled out by experimentation.
An explanation that is not ruled out by repeated experimentation, and makes predictions that are shown to be true.
Developing new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
