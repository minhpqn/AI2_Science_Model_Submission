The process of designing a new technology includes much more than just coming up with a good idea.
Possible limitations, or constraints, on the design must be taken into account.
These might include factors such as the cost or safety of the new product or process.
Making and testing a model of the design are also important.
These steps ensure that the design actually works to solve the problem.
This process also gives the designer a chance to find problems and modify the design if necessary.
No solution is perfect, but testing and refining a design assures that the technology will provide a workable solution to the problem it is intended to solve.
Steps of the Technological Design Process
The technological design process can be broken down into the series of steps shown in the flowchart in Figure below .
Typically, some of the steps have to be repeated, and the steps may not always be done in the sequence shown.
Flowchart of the technological design process
This flowchart illustrates the steps of the technological design process.
Consider the problem of developing a solar-powered car.
Many questions would have to be researched in the design process.
For example, what is the best shape for gathering the sunâ€™s rays?
How will sunlight be converted to useable energy to run the car?
Will a back-up energy source be needed?
After researching the answers, possible designs are developed.
This generally takes imagination as well as sound reasoning.
Then a model must be designed and tested.
