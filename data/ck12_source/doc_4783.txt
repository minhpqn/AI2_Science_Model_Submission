Together they can form countless combinations of organic compounds.
And in just the right combinations, anything can happen.
Living things are made of matter.
In fact, matter is the “stuff” of which all things are made.
Anything that occupies space and has mass is known as matter.
Matter, in turn, consists of chemical substances.
A chemical substance is a material that has a definite chemical composition.
It is also homogeneous, so the same chemical composition is found uniformly throughout the substance.
A chemical substance may be an element or a chemical compound.
An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into different types of substances.
There are almost 120 known elements ( Figure below ), each with its own personality.
The chemical and physical properties of one element differ from any other.
Elements are arranged according to their properties in the Periodic Table .
The Periodic Table.
Examples of elements include carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, gold, silver and iron.
Each element is made up of just one type of atom.
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that still characterizes the element.
As shown in Figure below , at the center of an atom is a nucleus.
The nucleus contains positively charged particles called protons and electrically neutral particles called neutrons.
Surrounding the nucleus is a much larger electron cloud consisting of negatively charged electrons.
