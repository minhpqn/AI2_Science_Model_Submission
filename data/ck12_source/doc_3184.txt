Wavelength and Wave Energy
The wavelength of a wave is related to the waveâ€™s energy.
Short-wavelength waves have more energy than long-wavelength waves of the same amplitude. (Amplitude is a measure of how far particles of the medium move up and down or back and forth when a wave passes through them.) You can see examples of transverse waves with shorter and longer wavelengths in the Figure below .
Waves with short and long wavelengths
Q:
Of all the colors of visible light, red light has the longest wavelength and violet light has the shortest wavelength.
Which color of light has the greatest energy?
A:
Violet light has the greatest energy because it has the shortest wavelength.
Wavelength is one way of measuring the size of waves.
It is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves, usually measured in meters.
The wavelength of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests.
The wavelength of a longitudinal wave can be measured as the distance between two adjacent compressions.
Short-wavelength waves have more energy than long-wavelength waves of the same amplitude.
