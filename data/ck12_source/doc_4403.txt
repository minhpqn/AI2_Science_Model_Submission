Hummingbird Sipping Nectar.
A hummingbird gets nectar from flowers and pollinates the flowers in return.
What type of relationship exists between the bird and the flowering plant?
Birds at Risk
Hundreds of species of birds have gone extinct as a result of human actions.
A well-known example is the passenger pigeon.
It was once the most common bird in North America, but overhunting and habitat destruction led to its extinction in the 1800s.
Habitat destruction and use of the pesticide DDT explain the recent extinction of the dusky seaside sparrow.
This native Florida bird was declared extinct in 1990.
Today, some 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human actions.
Humans need to take steps to protect this precious and important natural resource.

The Golden Eagle
Although not as famous as its bald cousin, Golden Eagles are much easier to find in Northern California - one of the largest breeding populations for Golden Eagles.
The largest of the raptors, Golden Eagles weigh typically between 8 and 12 pounds, and their wing span is around 6 to 7 feet.
These eagles dive towards earth to catch prey, and can reach speeds of up to 200 mph!
