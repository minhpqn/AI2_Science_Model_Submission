Aristotle (384 BCE – 322 BCE) demonstrates in his writings that he knew we see the moon by the light of the sun, how the phases of the moon occur, and understood how eclipses work.
He also knew that the earth was a sphere.
Philosophically, he argued that each part of the earth is trying to be pulled to the center of the earth, and so the earth would naturally take on a spherical shape.
He then pointed out observations that support the idea of a spherical earth.
First, the shadow of the earth on the moon during a lunar eclipse is always circular.
The only shape that always casts a circular shadow is a sphere.
Second, as one traveles more north or south, the positions of the stars in the sky change.
There are constellations visible in the north that one cannot see in the south and vice versa.
He related this to the curvature of the earth.
Aristotle talked about the work of earlier Greeks, who had developed an earth centered model of the planets.
In these models, the center of the earth is the center of all the other motions.
While it is not sure if the earlier Greeks actually thought the planets moved in circles, it is clear that Aristotle did.
Aristotle rejected a moving earth for two reasons.
Most importantly he didn’t understand inertia.
To Aristotle, the natural state for an object was to be at rest.
He believed that it takes a force in order for an object to move.
Using Aristotle’s ideas, if the earth were moving through space, if you tripped, you would not be in contact with the earth, and so would get left behind in space.
Since this obviously does not happen, the earth must not move.
This misunderstanding of inertia confused scientists until the time of Galileo.
A second, but not as important, reason Aristotle rejected a moving earth is that he recognized that if the earth moved and rotated around the sun, there would be an observable parallax of the stars.
