Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate.
Altitude and Temperature
Air temperature falls at higher altitudes ( Figure below ).
Why does this happen?
Since air is less dense at higher altitudes, its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level.
These molecules have fewer collisions, so they produce less heat.
Graph showing air temperature vs altitude
Air temperature drops as you go higher.
Look at the mountain pictured below ( Figure below ).
The peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania (Africa, 3° south latitude) is 6 kilometers (4 miles) above sea level.
At 3°S, it’s very close to the Equator.
At the bottom of the mountain, the temperature is high year round.
How can you tell that it’s much cooler at the top?
Mount Kilimanjaro has very different climates at the top and bottom
Mount Kilimanjaro has very different climates at the top and bottom.
Mountains and Precipitation
Mountains can also affect precipitation.
Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow .
As winds rise up the windward side of a mountain range, the air cools and precipitation falls.
On the other side of the range, the leeward side, the air is dry, and it sinks.
