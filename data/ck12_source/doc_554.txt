B and T cells must be “switched on” in order to fight a specific pathogen.
Once this happens, they produce an army of cells ready to fight that particular pathogen.
How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens?
Pathogens have proteins, often located on their cell surface.
These proteins are called antigens.
An antigen is any protein that causes an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the body makes.
Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.
Your body sees these as foreign, meaning they do not belong in your body.
The immune system includes lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes.
Lymph organs include the red bone marrow, thymus gland, spleen, and tonsils.
Lymphocytes, including B cells and T cells, are key cells in the immune response.
