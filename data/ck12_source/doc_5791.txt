Since the noble gases are a special group because of their lack of reactivity, the element fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal.
It is not found in nature as a free element.
Fluorine gas reacts explosively with many other elements and compounds and is considered to be one of the most dangerous known substances.
Note that there is no clear division between metallic and non-metallic character.  As we move across the periodic table, there is an increasing tendency to accept electrons (non-metallic) and a decrease in the possibility that an atom would give up one or more electrons.
Metallic character refers to the level of reactivity of a metal.
Non-metallic character relates to the tendency to accept electrons during chemical reactions.
Metallic tendency increases going down a group.
Non-metallic tendency increases going from left to right across the periodic table.
