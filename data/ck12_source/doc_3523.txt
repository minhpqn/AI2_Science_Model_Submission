A mitochondrion ( mitochondria , plural), is a membrane-enclosed organelle that is found in most eukaryotic cells.
Mitochondria are called the "power plants" of the cell because they are the sites of cellular respiration, where they use energy from organic compounds to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
ATP is the cell's energy source that is used for such things such as movement and cell division.
Some ATP is made in the cytosol of the cell, but most of it is made inside mitochondria.
The number of mitochondria in a cell depends on the cell’s energy needs.
For example, active human muscle cells may have thousands of mitochondria, while less active red blood cells do not have any.
Electron micrograph and illustration of a mitochondrion

Electron micrograph of a single mitochondrion, within which you can see many cristae.
Mitochondria range from 1 to 10 μm in size. (b):
This model of a mitochondrion shows the organized arrangement of the inner and outer membranes, the protein matrix, and the folded inner mitochondrial membranes.
As Figure above (a) and (b) show, a mitochondrion has two phospholipid membranes.
The smooth outer membrane separates the mitochondrion from the cytosol.
The inner membrane has many folds, called cristae .
The fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrion, called matrix , is where most of the cell’s ATP is made.
Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, mitochondria have their own DNA.
Mitochondria are able to reproduce asexually, and scientists think that they are descended from prokaryotes.
According to the endosymbiotic theory, mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes that infected or were engulfed by ancient eukaryotic cells.
The invading prokaryotes were protected inside the eukaryotic host cell, and in turn the prokaryote supplied extra ATP to its host.
Ribosomes are small organelles and are the site of protein synthesis.
