Rimoin (1936-2012).
Dr.
McKusick is widely regarded as the '"Father of Medical Genetics." He was the original author and editor of Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM) and its online version Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) , a database of heritable diseases and genes.
In 1957, Dr.
McKusick established a medical genetics clinic at Johns Hopkins University, thought to be one of the first two such clinics in the US at that time.
Today there are over 100 such clinics throughout the US, and many more throughout the world, training thousands of individuals.
Dr.
McKusick also played a leading role in investigating whether Abraham Lincoln had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome.
Dr.
Rimoin is considered by many to be the founder of the medical genetics clinical specialty.
He was the founding president of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and a founding president of the American Board of Medical Genetics.
He was a pioneer in the study of dwarfism.
He developed a Tay-Sachs screening program and determined that diabetes is caused by a variety of genetic abnormalities.
Both Drs.
McKusick and Rimoin were experts and pioneers in the study of the clinical and genetic understanding of human skeletal disorders.
