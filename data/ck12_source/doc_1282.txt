Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries.
But some activity does not.
Much of this intraplate activity is found at hot spots.
Hotspots are plumes of hot material that rise through the mantle.
Hotspot volcanoes erupt when the hot material melts to create magma.
Many hotspots appear to be fixed in the mantle.
This means that they do not move relative to each other.
Plates move above the hotspots, but the hotspots stay in the same spot.
This feature is a very useful tool for scientists.
Hotspots in the Oceans
A chain of volcanoes form as an oceanic plate moves over a hotspot.
This is how it happens.
A volcano forms over the hotspot.
Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot.
When the hotspot erupts again, a new volcano forms over it.
This volcano is next to the first.
Over time, there is a line of volcanoes.
The youngest is directly above the hotspot.
The oldest is the farthest away ( Figure below ).
