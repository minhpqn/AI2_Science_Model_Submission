Do you know when you're digesting food?
Unless you have an upset stomach, digestion usually happens without you even noticing.
You consciously chew up your food, but most of the digestive process takes place without your conscious awareness.
Long after you put down your fork, food is still passing through your stomach and small intestine.
It may take over a day for a meal to pass all the way through your digestive system.

What organs and processes break down the foods and make the nutrients available to cells?
The organs are those of the digestive system.
The processes are digestion and absorption.
The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food and absorbs nutrients.
It also gets rid of solid food waste.
The digestive system is mainly one long tube from the mouth to the anus, known as the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract).
The main organs of the digestive system include the esophagus, stomach and the intestine, and are pictured below ( Figure below ).
The intestine is divided into the small and large intestine.
