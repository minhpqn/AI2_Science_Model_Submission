Which paint can has greater potential energy after the painter carries it up the ladder?
Why is this can’s potential energy greater?
How could the painter give the other can more potential energy?
What is potential energy?
Compare and contrast gravitational and elastic potential energy, and give an example of each.
The diver on the diving board in the opening picture weighs 500 Newtons.
The diving board is 5 meters above the ground.
What is the diver’s gravitational potential energy?
Why does food have potential energy?
Forms of Energy
Identify and describe different forms of energy.
This musician’s electric guitar wails at a concert, as colored lights wash over the band.
It’s hot on stage because of the lights, but they really add to the show.
The fans are thrilled and screaming with excitement.
The exciting concert wouldn’t be possible without several different forms of energy.
Do you know what they are?
Introducing Forms of Energy
Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many different forms.
Energy can also change from one form to another.
The photo above of the guitar player represents six forms of energy: mechanical, chemical, electrical, light, thermal, and sound energy.
