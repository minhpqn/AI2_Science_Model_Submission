During binary fission, the chromosome copies itself, forming two genetically identical copies.
Then, the cell enlarges and divides into two new daughter cells.
The two daughter cells are identical to the parent cell.
Binary fission can happen very rapidly.
Some species of bacteria can double their population in less than ten minutes!
Sexual reproduction does not occur in bacteria.
But not all new bacteria are clones.
This is because bacteria can acquire new DNA.
This process occurs in three different ways:
Conjugation :
In conjugation, DNA passes through an extension on the surface of one bacterium and travels to another bacterium ( Figure below ).
Bacteria essential exchange DNA via conjugation.
Transformation :
In transformation, bacteria pick up pieces of DNA from their environment.
Transduction :
In transduction, viruses that infect bacteria carry DNA from one bacterium to another.
Conjugation in bacteria
Bacteria can exchange small segments of DNA through conjugation.
Notice two bacterial cells are attached by a short extension.
DNA can be exchanged through this extension.
