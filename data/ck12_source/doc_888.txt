Planting the same crop each year can remove nutrients from the soil.
This means that wood, cork, bamboo, and crops can be sustainable resources.
Wind power is a renewable resource that can be harvested with wind farms
Wind power, a renewable resource, shown here in a modern wind energy farm.
The wind is used to turn turbines that generate electricity.
Alternative Energy Sources
A nonrenewable resource is one that cannot be replaced as easily as it is consumed.
Fossil fuels are an example of nonrenewable resources.
They take millions of years to form naturally, and so they cannot be replaced as fast as they are consumed.
To take the place of fossil fuel use, alternative energy resources are being developed.
These alternative energy sources often utilize renewable resources.
The following are examples of sustainable alternative energy resources:
Solar power , which uses solar cells to turn sunlight into electricity ( Figure below ).
The electricity can be used to power anything that uses normal coal-generated electricity.
Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity
These solar panels convert sunlight into electricity.
Wind power , which uses windmills to transform wind energy into electricity.
It is used for less than 1% of the worldâ€™s energy needs.
But wind energy is growing fast.
Every year, 30% more wind energy is used to create electricity.
