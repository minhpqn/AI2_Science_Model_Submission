Each unlabeled point where lines intersect represents another carbon atom.
Some of these carbons and the oxygen atom are bonded to another hydrogen atom, not shown here.
Mixtures vs.
Compounds
Like a chemical compound, a mixture consists of more than one chemical substance.
Unlike a compound, a mixture does not have a fixed chemical composition.
The substances in a mixture can be combined in any proportions.
A mixture also does not involve a chemical reaction.
Therefore, the substances in a mixture are not changed into unique new substances, and they can be separated from each other without a chemical reaction.
The following examples illustrate these differences between mixtures and compounds.
Both examples involve the same two elements: the metal iron (Fe) and the nonmetal sulfur (S).
When iron filings and sulfur powder are mixed together in any ratio, they form a mixture.
No chemical reaction occurs, and both elements retain their individual properties.
A magnet can be used to mechanically separate the two elements by attracting the iron filings out of the mixture and leaving the sulfur behind.
When iron and sulfur are mixed together in a certain ratio and heated, a chemical reaction occurs.
This results in the formation of a unique new compound, called iron sulfide (FeS).
A magnet cannot be used to mechanically separate the iron from the iron sulfide because metallic iron does not exist in the compound.
Instead, another chemical reaction is required to separate the iron and sulfur.
atom :
The smallest particle of an element that still characterizes the element.
