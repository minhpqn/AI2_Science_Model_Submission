Tyrosine kinase receptors bind many polypeptide growth factors, cytokines, and hormones.
Once the ligand is bound, these receptors specifically phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids, activating the signal transduction process inside the cell.
A G-protein linked receptor is a receptor that works with the help of a protein called a G-protein.
A G-protein gets its name from the molecule to which it is attached, guanosine triphosphate (GTP), or guanosine diphosphate (GDP).
The GTP molecule is similar to ATP.
Once G proteins or protein kinase enzymes are activated by a receptor protein - after the ligand binds to its receptor - they create molecules called second messengers.
A second messenger is a small molecule that starts a change inside a cell in response to the binding of a specific signal to a receptor protein.
Some second messenger molecules include small molecules called cyclic nucleotides, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
Calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) also act as secondary messengers.
Secondary messengers are a part of signal transduction pathways.
Two-component signal transduction system.
This process begins with the stimulus binding to its receptor.
Shown here is a cell-surface receptor.
The signal in then transduced to the inside of the cell.
Some receptors bind the ligand internally.
In this case, the ligand must be able to enter the cell.
These receptors usually interact with steroid and thyroid hormones.
Once the ligand binds to the receptor, the receptor becomes activated, and the whole complex enters the nucleus, hence these receptors are known as nuclear receptors.
In the nucleus, the activated receptor acts as a transcription factor, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.
