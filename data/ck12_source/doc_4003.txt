Viruses are not cells; they are a strand of genetic material within a protective protein coat called a capsid .
They infect a wide variety of organisms, including both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Once inside the cell, they use the cellâ€™s ATP, ribosomes, enzymes, and other cellular parts to replicate.
Viruses can be found almost anywhere there is life, including living within prokaryotes.
A phage is a virus that infects prokaryotes.
Phages are estimated to be the most widely distributed and diverse entities in the biosphere, even more numerous than prokaryotic organisms.
Phages can be found everywhere their hosts are found, such as in soil, in the intestine of animals, or seawater.
Up to 10 9 virions have been found in a milliliter of seawater, and up to 70 percent of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.
They are also found in drinking water and in some foods, including fermented vegetables and meats, where they control the growth of bacteria.
Viruses are tiny particles, smaller than prokaryotic cells.
Viruses are not cells and cannot replicate without help, but they have nucleic acids and can evolve.
