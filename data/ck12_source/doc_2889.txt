Just 20 different amino acids are arranged in many different combinations to make thousands of proteins.
Cells Can Turn Genes On or Off
There are about 22,000 genes in every human cell.
Does every human cell have the same genes?
Yes.
Does every human cell make the same proteins?
No.
In a multicellular organism, such as us, cells have specific functions because they have different proteins.
They have different proteins because different genes are expressed in different cell types (which is known as gene expression ).
Imagine that all of your genes are "turned off." Each cell type only "turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have the code for the proteins it needs to use.
So different cell types "turn on" different genes, allowing different proteins to be made.
This gives different cell types different functions.
Once a gene is expressed, the protein product of that gene is usually made.
For this reason, gene expression and protein synthesis are often considered the same process.
DNA contains the instructions to assemble amino acids in a specific order to make protein.
Each cell type only "turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have the code for the proteins it needs to use.
Gene expression and protein synthesis are usually considered the same molecular process.
