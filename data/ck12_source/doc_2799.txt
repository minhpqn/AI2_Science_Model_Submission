A concentrated solution has more solute in a given amount of solvent than a dilute solution.
The concentration of a solution can be calculated with this formula:
\mathrm{Concentration= \frac{Mass \; (or \; volume) \; of \;
Solute}{Mass \; (or \; volume) \; of \;
Solution} \times 100\%}

What is the difference between a dilute and a concentrated solution?
What is the concentration of a 500 mL solution that contains 5 mL of solute?
James mixed added 25 grams of solute with 75 grams of solvent.
Then he calculated the concentration of the solution as:
\mathrm{Concentration(B)= \frac{25\; g}{75\; g} \times 100\%}=33\%
What error did James make in his calculation?
What is the correct concentration of this solution?
