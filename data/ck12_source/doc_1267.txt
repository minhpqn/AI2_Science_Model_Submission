Plates move apart at a divergent plate boundary .
This happens in the oceans at mid-ocean ridges.
It happens on land in continental rift zones.
In the oceans, plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges.
Lava rises upward, erupts, and cools.
Later, more lava erupts and pushes the original seafloor outward.
This is seafloor spreading.
Seafloor spreading forms new oceanic crust.
The rising magma causes the ridge to be buoyant.
This is why there is a mountain range running through the oceans.
The plates pulling apart cause earthquakes.
Most mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea.
The island of Iceland sits right on the Mid-Atlantic ridge ( Figure below ).

A divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent.
This is called continental rifting .
Magma rises beneath the continent.
The crust thins, breaks, and then splits apart.
This first produces a rift valley.
