Forces on Charged Objects
Describe the changes that occur in the sub-atomic arrangement in matter when charged.
Describe how to charge an object.
Define conductors and insulators.
Understand the difference between conduction and induction.
Summarize the forces between charged objects.
Multiple lightning discharges from a single cloud
Lightning is the discharge of static electricity that has built up on clouds.
Every year, the earth experiences an average of 25 million lightning strikes.
Lightning bolts travel at speeds up to 60,000 miles per second, and can reach temperatures of 50,000Â°F, which is five times the temperature of the surface of the sun.
The energy contained in a single lightning strike could light a 100 Watt light bulb 24 hours per day for 90 days.
Forces on Charged Objects
Electric charges exist within the atom.
At the turn of the 20th century, J.
J.
Thomson and Ernest Rutherford determined that atoms contain very light-weight negatively charged particles called electrons and more massive, positively charged particles called protons .  The protons are lodged in the nucleus of the atoms, along with the neutrally charged particles called neutrons, while the electrons surround the nucleus.
When the number of electrons in the electron cloud and the number of protons in the nucleus are equal, the object is said to be neutral .
Changes to the nucleus of an atom require tremendous amounts of energy, so protons are not easily gained or lost by atoms.
Electrons, on the other hand, are held fairly loosely and can often be removed quite easily.
When an object loses some electrons, the remaining object is now positively charged because it has an excess of protons.
