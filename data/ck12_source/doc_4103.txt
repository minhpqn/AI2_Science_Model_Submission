In fish they develop into gills, but in humans they disappear before birth.
The presence of the gill slits suggests that a long time ago humans and fish shared a common ancestor.
The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related and have common ancestors.
For example, humans did not evolve from chimpanzees.
But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees.
As our common ancestor evolved, humans and chimpanzees went down different evolutionary paths and developed different traits.
Vestigial structures, or structures that have lost their use through evolution, are important evidence of evolution.
Studying the embryos of organisms also provides evidence that two very different animals could have descended from a common ancestor.
