The best-known method of radiometric dating is carbon-14 dating .
This method is also called radiocarbon dating.
A living thing takes in carbon-14 (along with stable carbon-12).
As the carbon-14 decays, it is replaced with more carbon-14.
After the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon.
That includes carbon-14.
The carbon-14 that is in its body continues to decay.
So the organism contains less and less carbon-14 as time goes on.
We can estimate the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed by measuring the amount of carbon-14 to carbon-12.
We know how fast carbon-14 decays.
With this information, we can tell how long ago the organism died.
Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life.
It decays quickly compared to some other unstable isotopes.
So carbon-14 dating is useful for specimens younger than 50,000 years old.
Thatâ€™s a blink of an eye in geologic time.
But radiocarbon dating is very useful for more recent events.
One important use of radiocarbon is early human sites.
Carbon-14 dating is also limited to the remains of once-living things.
To date rocks, scientists use other radioactive isotopes.
