If reactant molecules collide and move together, there must be enough energy left for them to react.
Rates of Chemical Reactions
The rates at which chemical reactions take place in organisms are very important.
Chemical reactions in organisms are involved in processes ranging from the contraction of muscles to the digestion of food.
For example, when you wave goodbye, it requires repeated contractions of muscles in your arm over a period of a couple of seconds.
A huge number of reactions must take place in that time, so each reaction cannot take longer than a few milliseconds.
If the reactions took much longer, you might not finish waving until sometime next year.
Factors that help reactant molecules collide and react speed up chemical reactions.
These factors include the concentration of reactants and the temperature at which the reactions occur.
Reactions are usually faster at higher concentrations of reactants.
The more reactant molecules there are in a given space, the more likely they are to collide and react.
Reactions are usually faster at higher temperatures.
Reactant molecules at higher temperatures have more energy to move, collide, and react.
