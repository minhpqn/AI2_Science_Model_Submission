You can see an example of this in the Figure below .
In other chemical changes, an odor is produced or gas bubbles are released.
All of these changes can be observed with the senses.
Shiny copper new pennies and dull brown old pennies
Some of these pennies are shiny and copper colored.
That’s how pennies look when they are new.
The older pennies are dull and brown.
Copper at the surface of these pennies has combined with air to become a different substance with different properties.
The change in color shows that a chemical change has occurred.
Q:
Some chemical changes release heat.
How could this change be observed?
A:
The sense of touch—or a thermometer—could be used to observe an increase in temperature.
An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses.
Observations raise questions that lead to scientific investigations.
Observations also help scientists gather evidence in investigations.
We make many observations using our sense of hearing.
Test your ability to make sound observations by doing the activity “Identifying Sounds” at this URL.
