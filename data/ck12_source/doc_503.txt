With no room to expand, the brain pushes against the skull.
This may injure the brain and even cause death.
Medicines can help fight some viral infections of the brain, but not all infections.
Encephalitis is a brain infection that causes swelling that can eventually push the brain against the skull, damaging it
This scan shows a person with encephalitis.
Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.
If you have meningitis, you are likely to have a fever and a headache.
Another telltale symptom is a stiff neck.
Meningitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria.
Viral meningitis often clears up on its own after a few days.
Bacterial meningitis is much more serious ( Figure below ).
It may cause brain damage and death.
People with bacterial meningitis need emergency medical treatment.
They are usually given antibiotics to kill the bacteria.
These small bacteria can cause brain damage and death due to meningitis
These bacteria, shown at more than 1,000 times their actual size, are the cause of bacterial meningitis.
Despite their tiny size, they can cause very serious illness.
A vaccine to prevent meningitis recently became available.
It can be given to children as young as two years old.
Many doctors recommend that children receive the vaccine no later than age 12 or 13, or before they begin high school.
