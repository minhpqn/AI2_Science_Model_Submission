One you have for life, the other just lasts a few years.
One is the basis for the passing of traits from one generation to the next.
Some jeans you change frequently.
But what happens when you change a gene's frequency?
Essentially, evolution is a change in gene frequencies within a population.
Genes in Populations
Darwin knew that heritable variations are needed for evolution to occur.
However, he knew nothing about Mendel’s laws of genetics.
Mendel’s laws were rediscovered in the early 1900s.
Only then could scientists fully understand the process of evolution.
We now know that variations of traits are heritable.
These variations are determined by different alleles .
We also know that evolution is due to a change in alleles over time.
How long a time?
That depends on the scale of evolution.
Microevolution occurs over a relatively short period of time within a population or species.
The Grants observed this level of evolution in Darwin’s finches (see the "Biogeography" concept).
Macroevolution occurs over geologic time above the level of the species.
The fossil record reflects this level of evolution.
It results from microevolution taking place over many generations.
