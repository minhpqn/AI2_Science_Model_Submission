Diagram of a transistor
An integrated circuit—also called a microchip—is a tiny, flat piece of silicon that consists of layers of many electronic components such as transistors.
You can see an integrated circuit in the Figure below .
Look how small it is compared with the finger it’s resting on.
Although the integrated circuit is tiny, it may contain millions of smaller electronic components.
Current flows extremely rapidly in an integrated circuit because it doesn’t have far to travel.
Integrated circuits are used in virtually all modern electronic devices to carry out specific tasks.

Microchips are very small
Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as computers.
Types of electronic components include diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits.
Electronic components consist of semiconductors, which are solid crystals consisting mainly of silicon.
There are two types of semiconductors, called n-type and p-type.
A diode is an electronic component consisting of two semiconductors.
It is used to change alternating current to direct current.
A transistor is an electronic component consisting of three semiconductors.
It can be used to turn current on or off or to increase current.
