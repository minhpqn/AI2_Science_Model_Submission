The enthalpy change for a chemical reaction.
thermochemical equation:
A chemical equation that includes the enthalpy change of the reaction.
Stoichiometric Calculations and Enthalpy Changes
Perform calculations of enthalpy equations.
Enthalpy changes are important in many fields
What will it cost?
There is a growing concern about the damage to the environment from emissions from manufacturing plants.
Many companies are taking steps to reduce these harmful emissions by adding equipment that will trap the pollutants.
In order to know what equipment (and how many) to order, studies need to be done to measure the amount of product currently produced.
The since pollution is often both particulate and thermal, energy changes need to be determined in addition to the amounts of products released.
Stoichiometric Calculations and Enthalpy Changes
Chemistry problems that involve enthalpy changes can be solved by techniques similar to stoichiometry problems.  Refer again to the combustion reaction of methane.
Since the reaction of 1 mol of methane released 890.4 kJ, the reaction of 2 mol of methane would release 2 \times 890.4 \text{ kJ} = 1781 \text{ kJ} .
The reaction of 0.5 mol of methane would release \frac{890.4 \text{ kJ}}{2}= 445.2 \text{ kJ} .
As with other stoichiometry problems, the moles of a reactant or product can be linked to mass or volume.
Sample Problem:
Calculating Enthalpy Changes
Sulfur dioxide gas reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide in an exothermic reaction according to the following thermochemical equation.
2\text{SO}_2(\text{g}) + \text{O}_2(\text{g}) \rightarrow 2\text{SO}_3(\text{g})+198 \text{ kJ}
