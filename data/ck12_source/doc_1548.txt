Conduction happens mainly in the lower atmosphere.
Can you explain why?
Convection is the transfer of heat by a current.
Convection happens in a liquid or a gas.
Air near the ground is warmed by heat radiating from Earth's surface.
The warm air is less dense, so it rises.
As it rises, it cools.
The cool air is dense, so it sinks to the surface.
This creates a convection current ( Figure below ).
Convection is the most important way that heat travels in the atmosphere.

Convection currents are the main way that heat moves through the atmosphere.
Why does warm air rise?
In conduction, heat moves from areas of more heat to areas of less heat.
The substances must be in direct contact.
In convection, materials move depending on their heat relative to nearby materials.
In radiation, energy moves by waves.
