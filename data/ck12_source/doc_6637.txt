She saw a chimpanzee strip leaves from a twig.
Then he poked the twig into a hole in a termite mound.
After termites climbed onto the twig, he pulled the twig out of the hole and ate the insects clinging to it.
The chimpanzee had made a tool to “fish” for termites.
He had used insight to solve a problem.
Since then, chimpanzees have been seen making several different types of tools.
For example, they sharpen sticks and use them as spears for hunting.
They use stones as hammers to crack open nuts.
Scientists have also observed other species of animals making tools to solve problems.
A crow was seen bending a piece of wire into a hook.
Then the crow used the hook to pull food out of a tube.
An example of a gorilla using a walking stick is shown below ( Figure below ).
Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems.
They can learn through insight.
Gorilla using a branch as a tool
This gorilla is using a branch as a tool.
She is leaning on it to keep her balance while she reaches down into swampy water to catch a fish.
Learned behavior is behavior that occurs only after experience or practice.
Methods of learning include habituation, observational learning, conditioning, play, and insight learning.
