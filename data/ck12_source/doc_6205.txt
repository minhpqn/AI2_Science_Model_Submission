The two vascular tissues are xylem and phloem.
Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant.
Phloem carries the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed.
Stomata are pores in leaves that allow gasses to pass through
Stomata are pores in leaves that allow gasses to pass through, but they can be closed to conserve water.
Plants evolved from freshwater green algae.
Plants have evolved several adaptations to life on land, including embryo retention, a cuticle, stomata, and vascular tissue.
