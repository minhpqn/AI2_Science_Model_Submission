What happens to the strength of an electromagnet if the number of loops of wire is increased?
What happens to the strength of an electromagnet if the current in the wire is increased?
Which direction does the magnetic field point in the solenoid sketched here?
Practice problem for determining the direction of the magnetic field of a solenoid
solenoid:
A current-carrying coil of wire that acts like a magnet when a current passes through it.
electromagnet:
A temporary magnet consisting of an iron or steel core wound with a coil of wire, through which a current is passed.
magnetic levitation:
The suspension of an object above a second object by means of magnetic repulsion.
