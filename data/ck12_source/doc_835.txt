How are terrestrial biomes defined?
Give four examples of terrestrial biomes.
What defines a desert?
Where is biodiversity the highest?
Give examples of marine biomes.
Define freshwater biome.
Distinguish the photic zone from the aphotic zone.
Explain dissolved oxygen and nutrient distribution in aquatic biomes.
Is there life deep in the ocean?
Yes, there is life even at great depths in the ocean.
One example of deep ocean life is this deep-sea chimaera.
Chimaeras are related to sharks and resemble them somewhat.
But most chimaeras are adapted for life thousands of feet under the ocean surface.
This is one example of an organism that lives in an aquatic biome.
Recall that terrestrial biomes are defined by their climate.
That's because plants and animals are adapted for certain amounts of temperature and moisture.
However, would aquatic biomes be classified in the same way?
No, that wouldn't make much senseâ€”all parts of an aquatic environment have plenty of water.
Aquatic biomes can be generally classified based on the amount of salt in the water.
Freshwater biomes have less than 1% salt and are typical of ponds and lakes, streams and rivers, and wetlands.
