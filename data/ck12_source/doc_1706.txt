This forms a low pressure cell.
The air begins to rotate around the low pressure cell.
Water vapor condenses.
If conditions are right, the storm will build into a hurricane in two to three days.
Hurricanes are huge and produce high winds.
Rainfall can be as high as 2.5 cm (1") per hour.
The total rainfall can be 20 billion metric tons daily.
The enormous amounts of energy released could equal the total annual electrical power consumption of the United States.
That's from just one storm.
Hurricanes can also generate tornadoes.
Hurricanes move with the prevailing winds.
In the Northern Hemisphere, they originate in the trade winds and are blown to the west.
When they reach the westerlies, they switch direction.
So they travel toward the north or northeast.
You can look at a map of hurricane tracks to see this happen ( Figure below ).
Hurricanes may cover 800 km (500 miles) in one day.
Map of Category 3 hurricanes
Track map of all hurricanes that have achieved Category 3 intensity in the Atlantic basin, without reaching higher intensities.
The points show the location of the storm at 6-hour intervals.
The colour represents the storm's maximum sustained wind speeds as classified in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and the shape of the data points represent the nature of the storm (see source link).
