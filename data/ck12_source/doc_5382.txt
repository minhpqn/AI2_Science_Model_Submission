A Russian publication concludes that 985,000 excess cancers occurred between 1986 and 2004 as a result of radioactive contamination.
The 2011 report of the European Committee on Radiation Risk calculates a total of 1.4 million excess cancers occurred as a result of this contamination.
Causes of Mutation
Is it possible for mutations to occur spontaneously, or does there have to be a cause of the mutation?
Well, the answer is that both are possible.
Mutagenesis is a process by which the genetic information of an organism is changed in a stable manner, resulting in a mutation.
In nature mutagenesis can lead to changes that are beneficial or harmful, or have no effect.
Harmful mutations can lead to cancer and various heritable diseases, but beneficial mutations are the driving force of evolution.
In 1927, Hermann Muller first demonstrated the effects of mutations with observable changes in chromosomes.
He induced mutagenesis by irradiating fruit flies with X-rays,
Mutagenesis may occur spontaneously or be induced.
A spontaneous mutation can just happen.
These mutations are not caused by an environmental factor, but occur during normal cellular processes.
A spontaneous mutation may be due to a mistake during DNA replication or transcription.
Mutations may also occur during mitosis and meiosis.
A mutation caused by an environmental factor, or mutagen , is known as an induced mutation .
Typical mutagens include chemicals, like those inhaled while smoking, and radiation, such as X-rays, ultraviolet light, and nuclear radiation.
Table below lists some spontaneous mutations that are common.
Examples of Mutagens.
Types of mutagens include radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents.
