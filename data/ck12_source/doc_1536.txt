Clouds in the mesosphere are very rare.
The ones that exist occur near the poles.
The clouds are called polar mesospheric clouds .
At the edge of these clouds are noctilucent clouds ( Figure below ).
They are forming more often now, perhaps as a result of climate change.
Noctilucent clouds in the mesosphere
Noctilucent clouds are the highest clouds in the atmosphere.
At the top of the mesosphere is the mesopause.
Temperatures here are colder than anywhere else in the atmosphere.
They are as low as -100° C (-212° F)!
Nowhere on Earth’s surface is it that cold.
The mesosphere has a very low density of gas molecules.
Temperature decreases in the mesosphere with altitude.
This is because the heat source is the stratosphere.
The mesosphere has red sprites, blue jets, and two types of clouds.
The mesosphere is no place for human life!
