X-ray diffraction can be used to precisely measure the size of small atoms
How can we measure size of atoms?
We have many data tables available to us in chemistry.
If we wanted to know the size of the lithium atom, we can easily look it up and find that this atom is 134 picometers across.
If we remove the outer electron, the lithium ion is now only 90 picometers in size.
How do we know this?
We donâ€™t have a ruler small enough to measure these tiny distances.
But we can use a technique called x-ray diffraction to shine beams of x-rays through a crystal of a lithium compound.
By measuring how much the beams are bent after they come through the crystal, we can calculate the size of the molecule.
This technique works both for small materials like lithium compounds and equally well for very large protein molecules.
A unit cell is the smallest portion of a crystal lattice that shows the three-dimensional pattern of the entire crystal.
A crystal can be thought of as the same unit cell repeated over and over in three dimensions.
The Figure below illustrates the relationship of a unit cell to the entire crystal lattice.
A unit cell is the basic subunit of a crystal lattice
A unit cell is the smallest repeating portion of a crystal lattice.
Unit cells occur in many different varieties.
As one example, the cubic crystal system is composed of three different types of unit cells: (1) simple cubic , (2) face-centered cubic , and (3) body-centered cubic .
These are shown in three different ways in the Figure below .
Crystals with the same shape can be composed of various unit cells
