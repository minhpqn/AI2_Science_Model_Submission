What are the three states of water in this photo?
Water is present as liquid, solid, and gas in this photo.
We take water for granted here on Earth because there is a lot of it!
The Water Molecule
A molecule of water ( Figure below ) is made of three atoms bonded together.
Two of these atoms are hydrogen and one atom is oxygen.
The hydrogen ions have a positive electrical charge.
The oxygen atom has a negative electrical charge.
The hydrogen atoms are located on one side and the oxygen atom on the other.
This means that the side with the hydrogen ions has a slightly positive charge.
The other side, the side without the hydrogen ions, has a slightly negative charge.
The water molecule is a polar molecule .
