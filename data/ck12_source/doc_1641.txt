While photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.
It is the released oxygen that is used by us and most other organisms for cellular respiration.
We breathe in that oxygen, which is carried through our blood to all our cells.
In our cells, oxygen allows cellular respiration to proceed.
Cellular respiration works best in the presence of oxygen.
Without oxygen, much less ATP would be produced.
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are important parts of the carbon cycle.
The carbon cycle is the pathways through which carbon is recycled in the biosphere.
While cellular respiration releases carbon dioxide into the environment, photosynthesis pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
The exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen during photosynthesis ( Figure below ) and cellular respiration worldwide helps to keep atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide at stable levels.
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are direct opposite reactions
Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are direct opposite reactions.
Energy from the sun enters a plant and is converted into glucose during photosynthesis.
Some of the energy is used to make ATP in the mitochondria during cellular respiration, and some is lost to the environment as heat.
The equation for cellular respiration is the direct opposite of photosynthesis.
The exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen thorough photosynthesis or cellular respiration worldwide helps to keep atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide at stable levels.
