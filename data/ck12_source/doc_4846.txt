Cell Biology - Advanced
What is a cell?
It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit necessary for life.
But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life.
This concept will discuss some of the fundamental properties of the cell with lessons that include the cell structure, transport in and out of the cell and cell communication.

Describe the importance of cells to biology.
Why is a cell so complex?
Cells have lots of things to do.
Some cells make the whole organism, so that one cell must do everything that organism needs to do to live.
Other cells perform specific functions, so they must be designed to do that specific activity.
Introduction to Cells
The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms.
A cell is also the smallest unit of life, with single-celled organisms present on this planet for over 3.5 billion years.
Single-celled ( unicellular ) organisms like bacteria are obviously composed of just one cell, whereas multicellular organisms can be composed of trillions of cells.
Multicellular organisms include protists (though single-celled protists also exist), fungi, plants and animals.
Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100 Âµm and therefore can only be observed under the microscope.
The one cell of a unicellular organism must be able to perform all the functions necessary for life.
These functions include metabolism, homeostasis and reproduction.
Specifically, these single cells must transport materials, obtain and use energy, dispose of wastes, and continuously respond to their environment.
