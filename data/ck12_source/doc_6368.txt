\Delta S = \text{change in entropy (J/K} \cdot \text{mol)}
T = \text{temperature (Kelvin)}
Note that all values are for substances in their standard state.
In performing calculations, it is necessary to change the units for \Delta S to kJ/K • mol, so that the calculation of \Delta G  is in kJ/mol.
Sample Problem:
Gibbs Free Energy
Methane gas reacts with water vapor to produce a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen according to the balanced equation below.
\text{CH}_4(g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}(g)+3\text{H}_2(g)
The  \Delta H^\circ for the reaction is +206.1 kJ/mol, while the \Delta S^\circ is +215 J/K • mol .
Calculate the  \Delta G^\circ at 25°C and determine if the reaction is spontaneous at that temperature.
Step 1:
List the known values and plan the problem.
\Delta H^\circ =206.1 \ \text{kJ/mol}
\Delta S^\circ = 215 \ \text{J/K}\cdot \text{mol}=0.215 \ \text{kJ/K}\cdot \text{mol}
T =25^\circ \text{C}=298 \ \text{K}
\Delta G^\circ =? \ \text{kJ/mol}
Prior to substitution into the Gibbs free energy equation, the entropy change is converted to  kJ/K • mol and the temperature to Kelvins.
Step 2:
Solve.
\Delta G^\circ =\Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ = 206.1 \ \text{kJ/mol} - 298 \ \text{K}(0.215 \ \text{kJ/K}\cdot \text{mol})=+142.0 \ \text{kJ/mol}
