Gravity is actually weaker than on Earth’s surface.
If you were at the top of the clouds on Uranus, you would weigh about 10 percent less than what you weigh on Earth.
The Sideways Planet
All of the planets rotate on their axes in the same direction that they move around the Sun.
Except for Uranus.
Uranus is tilted on its side.
Its axis is almost parallel to its orbit.
So Uranus rolls along like a bowling ball as it revolves around the Sun.
How did Uranus get this way?
Scientists think that the planet was struck and knocked over by another planet-sized object.
This collision probably took place billions of years ago.
Rings and Moons of Uranus
Uranus has a faint system of rings ( Figure below ).
The rings circle the planet’s equator.
However, Uranus is tilted on its side.
So the rings are almost perpendicular to the planet’s orbit.

This image from the Hubble Space Telescope uses infrared light filters to show the faint rings of Uranus.
We have discovered 27 moons around Uranus.
All but a few are named for characters from the plays of William Shakespeare.
