What equation did Newton use to represent the force of gravity between two objects?
What does each letter in the equation stand for?
Which letter stands for a value that never changes?
Based on the equation, how does the force of gravity between two objects change when the mass of one of the objects doubles?
If the distance between the two objects doubles, how does this affect the force of gravity between them?
What is Newton’s law of universal gravitation?
Describe the relationship between the masses of two objects and the force of gravity between them.
If two objects each have a mass of 10 kg, then the force of gravity between them
is 100 kg.
depends only on their masses.
is greater when they are closer together.
Einstein's Concept of Gravity
Identify limitations of Newton’s law of gravity.
Describe Einstein’s theory of gravity and how it differs from Newton’s law.
Why is jumping on a trampoline so much fun?
Its springy surface helps you jump higher than you ever could on the hard ground.
But even on a trampoline, you can’t keep jumping higher and higher.
Gravity always pulls you back down.
