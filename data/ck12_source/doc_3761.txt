Relative Dating Using Rock Layers.
Relative dating establishes which of two fossils is older than the other.
It is based on the rock layers in which the fossils formed.
Evidence from the fossil record can be combined with data from molecular clocks.
A molecular clock uses DNA sequences (or the proteins they encode) to estimate relatedness among species.
Molecular clocks estimate the time in geologic history when related species diverged from a common ancestor.
Molecular clocks are based on the assumption that mutations accumulate through time at a steady average rate for a given region of DNA.
Species that have accumulated greater differences in their DNA sequences are assumed to have diverged from their common ancestor in the more distant past.
Molecular clocks based on different regions of DNA may be used together for more accuracy.
Consider the example in Table below .
The table shows how similar the DNA of several animal species is to human DNA.
Based on these data, which organism do you think shared the most recent common ancestor with humans?

Geologic Time Scale
Another tool for understanding the history of Earth and its life is the geologic time scale , shown in Figure below .
The geologic time scale divides Earth’s history into divisions (such as eons, eras, and periods) that are based on major changes in geology, climate, and the evolution of life.
It organizes Earth’s history and the evolution of life on the basis of important events instead of time alone.
It also allows more focus to be placed on recent events, about which we know the most.
