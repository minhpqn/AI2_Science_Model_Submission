This means that there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow.
That’s because matter is always conserved in a chemical reaction.
This is the law of conservation of mass.
Look at the equation above for the reaction between carbon and oxygen in the formation of carbon dioxide.
Count the number of atoms of each type.
Are the numbers the same on both sides of the arrow?
The answer is yes, so the equation is balanced.
Let’s return to the chemical reaction in which iron (Fe) combines with oxygen (O 2 ) to form rust, or iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ).
The equation for this reaction is:
4Fe+ 3O 2 → 2Fe 2 O 3
This equation illustrates the use of coefficients to balance chemical equations.
A coefficient is a number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction.
From the equation for rusting, you can see that four atoms of iron combine with three molecules of oxygen to form two molecules of iron oxide.
Q:
Is the equation for the rusting reaction balanced?
How can you tell?
A:
Yes, the equation is balanced.
You can tell because there is the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow.
First count the iron atoms.
