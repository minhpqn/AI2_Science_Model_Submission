How do lungs allow air in?
Air moves into and out of the lungs by the movement of muscles.
The most important muscle in the process of breathing is the diaphragm , a sheet of muscle that spreads across the bottom of the rib cage.
The diaphragm and rib muscles contract and relax to move air into and out of the lungs.
During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward.
The rib muscles contract and cause the ribs to move outward.
This causes the chest volume to increase.
Because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside.
This difference in air pressures causes air to be sucked into the lungs.
When the diaphragm and rib muscles relax, air is pushed out of the lungs.
Exhalation is similar to letting the air out of a balloon.
How does the inhaled oxygen get into the bloodstream?
The exchange of gasses between the lungs and the blood happens in tiny sacs called alveoli .
The walls of the alveoli are very thin and allow gases to pass though them.
The alveoli are lined with capillaries ( Figure below ).
Oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries that surround the alveoli.
At the same time, carbon dioxide moves in the opposite direction, from capillary blood to the alveoli.
The gases move by simple diffusion, passing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
For example, initially there is more oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood, so oxygen moves by diffusion from the alveoli into the blood.
