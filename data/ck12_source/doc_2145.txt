You’ll buy fewer items in the long run, so you’ll save money as well as resources.
That's a win-win!
Repair rather than replace.
Fix your bike rather than buying a new one.
Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt.
You’ll use fewer resources and save money.
Buy only what you need.
Don’t buy a gallon of milk if you can only drink half of it before it spoils.
Instead, buy a half gallon and drink all of it.
You won’t be wasting resources (or money!).
Buy local.
For example, buy local produce at a farmer’s market, like the one pictured below ( Figure below ).
A lot of resources are saved by not shipping goods long distances.
Products bought at farmer's markets use less packaging, too!
Local produce at a farmer's market
Buying locally grown produce at a farmer's market saves resources.
About a third of what we throw out is packaging.
Try to buy items with the least amount of packaging.
For example, buy bulk items instead of those that are individually wrapped.
Also, try to select items with packaging that can be reused or recycled.
