From a single-celled organism that lacks a nucleus; prokaryote.
protein synthesis :
The process in which cells make proteins; includes transcription of DNA and translation of mRNA.
ribonucleoprotein :
A nucleoprotein that contains RNA; includes the ribosome, vault ribonucleoproteins, and small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs).
ribosomal RNA :
Type of RNA that helps form ribosomes and assemble proteins.
ribosome :
A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).
semi-permeable :
The feature of a cell membrane that allows only select molecules (ions and organic molecules) to enter and/or leave the cell.
transfer RNA (tRNA) :
Type of RNA that brings amino acids to ribosomes where they are joined together to form proteins.
translation :
The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.
Parts common to all cells are the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm, ribosomes, and genetic material.
