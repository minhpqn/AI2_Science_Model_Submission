Hormones and Digestion
If you are a typical teenager, you like to eat.
For your body to break down, absorb and spread the nutrients from your food throughout your body, your digestive system and endocrine system need to work together.
The endocrine system sends hormones around your body to communicate between cells.
Essentially, hormones are chemical messenger molecules.
Digestive hormones are made by cells lining the stomach and small intestine.
These hormones cross into the blood where they can affect other parts of the digestive system.
Some of these hormones are listed below.
Gastrin, which signals the secretion of gastric acid.
Cholecystokinin, which signals the secretion of pancreatic enzymes.
Secretin, which signals secretion of water and bicarbonate from the pancreas.
Ghrelin, which signals when you are hungry.
Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, which stops or decreases gastric secretion.
It also causes the release of insulin in response to high blood glucose levels.
Digestive enzymes speed up the reactions of chemical digestion.
Hormones, chemical messengers used to communicate between cells, are important in regulating digestion.
