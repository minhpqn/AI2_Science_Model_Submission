sexual reproduction :
Reproduction involving the joining of haploid gametes, producing genetically diverse individuals.
Sexual reproduction involves haploid gametes and produces a diploid zygote through fertilization.
Fertilization joins two haploid gametes into a diploid zygote.
Define sexual reproduction.
List the main differences between asexual and sexual reproduction.
How many chromosomes does a diploid human cell have?
How many chromosomes does a haploid human cell have?
Meiosis - Advanced
Identify and describe the main steps of meiosis, distinguishing between the quantity of genetic material in the parent and resulting cells.
How do you make a cell with half the DNA?
Meiosis.
This process allows cells to have half the number of chromosomes, so two of these cells can come back together to form a new organism with the complete number of chromosomes.
It not only helps produce gametes, it also ensures genetic variation.
Fertilization joins haploid gametes into a diploid zygote.
How do gametes end up with half the amount, a haploid amount, of DNA?
The mechanism that produces haploid cells is meiosis.
Meiosis is a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes.
Meiosis is specific to gamete producing cells in the gonads.
Meiosis begins with a diploid cell and ends with four haploid cells.
