An exoskeleton that may be bound together, such as in the carapace , the thick back shield seen in many crustaceans that often forms a protective space for the gills.
A main body cavity with an expanded circulatory system.
Blood is pumped by a heart located near the back.
A digestive system consisting of a straight tube that has a gastric mill for grinding food and a pair of digestive glands that absorb food.
Structures that function like kidneys to remove wastes.
These are located near the antennae.
A brain that exists in the form of ganglia , or connections between nerve cells.
Crustaceans periodically shed the outer skeleton, grow rapidly for a short time, and then form another hard skeleton.
They cannot grow underneath their outer exoskeleton.
They are very vulnerable during this time, as they lack their hard shell.
Most crustaceans have separate sexes, so they reproduce sexually using eggs and sperm.
Many land crustaceans, such as the Christmas Island red crab, mate every season and return to the sea to release the eggs.
Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land when the environment is damp.
In some crustaceans, the females keep the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.
Crustaceans include crabs, lobsters, shrimp, krill, and woodlice.
