The closely associated areas of two cells whose membranes join together; forms a virtually impermeable barrier to fluid.
Centrioles are made of short microtubules and are very important in cell division.
Cellular junctions allow cell association communication, and adhesion.
Use this resource to answer the questions that follow.
Inter Cellular Junctions - The Tissue Level of Organization at
List the 5 types of intercellular junctions.
Briefly describe each type of junction.
What is a connexon?
What is a cell junction?
Describe the structure of a gap junction.
How does the structure relate to its function?
Distinguish between tight junctions and desmosomes.
Plant Cells - Advanced
Identify and describe three structures that are present solely in plant cells.
What do plants have to do that animals don't?
When an animal needs energy, it eats food.
That's why animals use mitochondria to convert food into energy.
Plants, on the other hand, don't seem to eat anything.
Instead, they receive energy from water and sunlight.
They use chloroplasts to convert light into energy through photosynthesis.
