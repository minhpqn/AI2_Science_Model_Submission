A terrestrial arthropod, a species of woodlice.
Classes of Crustaceans
Six classes of crustaceans are generally recognized ( Table below ).
Mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus.
A small class of blind organisms found in deep caves connected to salt water.
Small crustaceans, with an eyeless head covered by a horseshoe-shaped shield; has two pairs of antennae and two pairs of jaws.
Mostly small, with a small abdomen, and generally no appendages.
Small animals with bivalve shells.
The largest class, with the largest and most familiar animals.
This class has the greatest diversity of body forms.
Crabs, lobsters, shrimp, krill, woodlice
Can Crustaceans Move?
Remember that crustaceans are an arthropod subphylum, and that arthropod means "jointed feet." As expected, the majority of crustaceans can move.
A few groups are parasitic and live attached to their hosts.
Adult barnacles ( Figure below ) cannot move, so they attach themselves headfirst to a rock or log.
Barnacles are non-moving crustaceans
Barnacles are non-moving crustaceans.
Many barnacles attach themselves to man-made structures.
