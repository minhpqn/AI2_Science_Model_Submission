The virus DNA is transcribed to mRNA which then leads to new virus protein and genome production.
Viral particles are assembled inside the cell and then exit the cell by budding.
The virus gets its viral envelope from the cellâ€™s plasma membrane.
The cycle begins again when the new particles infect another cell.
HIV infection is treated with a cocktail of several antiretroviral drugs.
The antiretroviral drugs prevent the virus from replicating and destroying more T cells, thus preventing the patients from developing AIDS.
Treatment with antiretroviral drugs can dramatically increase the life expectancy of people with HIV.
