This type of fermentation is carried out by the bacteria in yogurt.
It is also used by your own muscle cells when you work them hard and fast.
Lactic acid fermentation reaction
Lactic acid fermentation produces lactic acid and NAD + .
The NAD + cycles back to allow glycolysis to continue so more ATP is made.
Each circle represents a carbon atom.
Did you ever run a race and notice that your muscles feel tired and sore afterward?
This is because your muscle cells used lactic acid fermentation for energy.
This causes lactic acid to build up in the muscles.
It is the buildup of lactic acid that makes the muscles feel tired and sore.
In alcoholic fermentation , pyruvic acid changes to alcohol and carbon dioxide.
This is shown in Figure below .
NAD + also forms from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue making ATP.
This type of fermentation is carried out by yeasts and some bacteria.
It is used to make bread, wine, and biofuels.
Alcoholic fermentation reaction
Alcoholic fermentation produces ethanol and NAD+.
The NAD+ allows glycolysis to continue making ATP.
Have your parents ever put corn in the gas tank of their car?
They did if they used gas containing ethanol.
