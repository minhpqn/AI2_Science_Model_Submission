Some proteins act as signals, and other proteins receive those signals.
Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions in cells.
Other proteins are antibodies , which bind to foreign substances such as bacteria and target them for destruction.
Still other proteins carry messages or transport materials.
For example, human red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin , which binds with oxygen.
Hemoglobin allows the blood to carry oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body.
A model of the hemoglobin molecule is shown in Figure below .

Hemoglobin Molecule.
This model represents the protein hemoglobin.
The purple part of the molecule contains iron.
The iron binds with oxygen molecules.

As you view Protein Functions in the Body, focus on these concepts:
the amount of protein in each cell,
the roles of different types of proteins.
Proteins and Diet
Proteins in the diet are necessary for life.
Dietary proteins are broken down into their component amino acids when food is digested.
