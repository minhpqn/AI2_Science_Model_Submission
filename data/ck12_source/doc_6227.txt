Angiosperms , in the phylum Anthophyta , are the most successful phylum of plants.
This category also contains the largest number of individual plants ( Figure below ).
Angiosperms evolved the structure of the flower, so they are also called the flowering plants.
Angiosperms live in a variety of different environments.
A water lily, an oak tree, and a barrel cactus, although different, are all angiosperms.
Angiosperms are the flowering plants.

The Parts of a Flower
Even though flowers may look very different from each other, they do have some structures in common.
The structures are explained in the picture below ( Figure below ).
A complete flower has sepals, petals, stamens, and one or more carpels
A complete flower has sepals, petals, stamens, and one or more carpels.
The green outside of a flower that often looks like a leaf is called the sepal ( Figure below ).
All of the sepals together are called the calyx , which is usually green and protects the flower before it opens.
All of the petals ( Figure below ) together are called the corolla .
They are bright and colorful to attract a particular pollinator , an animal that carries pollen from one flower to another.
Examples of pollinators include birds and insects.
The next structure is the stamen , consisting of the stalk-like filament that holds up the anther , or pollen sac.
The pollen, which is found at the top of the stamen, is the male gametophyte.
At the very center is the carpel, which is divided into three different parts: (1) the sticky stigma , where the pollen lands, (2) the tube of the style , and (3) the large, bottom part, known as the ovary .
