What is the threshold effect?
What is meant by the recurrence risk?
Mendelian inheritance does not apply to the inheritance of alleles that result in incomplete dominance and codominance.
Explain why this is so.
Define codominance, incomplete dominance and polygenic trait.
A classmate tells you that a person can have type AO blood.
Do you agree?
Explain.
If you cross a red plant with a white plant and the offspring is pink, what is that called?
Effect of Environment on Genetics - Advanced
Outline how heredity and environment can interact to affect phenotype.
What do these twins have in common?
Almost all their DNA.
In fact, all their nuclear DNA.
Some of their mitochondrial DNA may have slight variations.
So that would mean that genetic studies involving twins can be potentially very rewarding.
Effects of Environment on Phenotype
Genes play an important part in influencing phenotype, but genes are not the only influence.
Environmental conditions, such as temperature and availability of nutrients can affect phenotypes.
For example, temperature affects coat color in Siamese cats.
