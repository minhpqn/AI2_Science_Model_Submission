Other drugs may be used to help control the symptoms of viral STIs, but they cannot be cured.
Once you have a viral STI, you are usually infected for life.
In the U.S., chlamydia is the most common STI caused by bacteria.
Females are more likely than males to develop the infection.
Rates of chlamydia among U.S. females in 2006 are shown below ( Figure below ).
Rates were much higher in teens and young women than in other age groups.
Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination.
It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis.
But in many cases it causes no symptoms.
As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they donâ€™t go to the doctor for help.
If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females.
It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries.
These infections may leave a woman unable to have children.
