The other elements may be metals, nonmetals, or both.
An alloy is formed by melting a metal and dissolving the other elements in it.
The molten solution is then allowed to cool and harden.
Alloys generally have more useful properties than pure metals.
Several examples of alloys are described and pictured below.
You can learn about another alloy—the amazing alloy called memory wire—at the following URL.
If you have braces on your teeth, you might even have this alloy in your mouth!
Examples of Alloys
Most metal objects are made of alloys rather than pure metals.
Objects made of four different alloys are shown in the Figure below .
Brass saxophones, stainless steel sinks, gold bracelets, and bronze statues are all made from alloys
Brass saxophone:
Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.
It is softer than bronze and easier to shape.
It's also very shiny.
Notice the curved pieces in this shiny brass saxophone.
Brass is used for shaping many other curved objects, such as doorknobs and plumbing fixtures.
Stainless steel sink:
Stainless steel is a type of steel that contains nickel and chromium in addition to carbon and iron.
It is shiny, strong, and resistant to rusting.
