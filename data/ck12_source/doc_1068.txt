Take one finger and move it along the latitude line to find your latitude.
Then move another finger along the longitude line to find your longitude.
Global Positioning System
In order to get latitude, longitude, and elevation you need several instruments.
What if you could do the same thing with only one instrument?
A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is all that is needed to locate your position on the Earth’s surface in many places.
By 1993, the United States military had launched 24 satellites to help soldiers locate their positions on battlefields.
This system of satellites was called the Global Positioning System (GPS).
Later, the United States government allowed the public to use this system.
Here’s how it works.
A GPS receiver and satellites
(a) You need a GPS receiver to use the GPS system. (b) It takes signals from four GPS satellites to find your location precisely on the surface.
You must have a GPS receiver to use the system.
You can buy many types of these in stores.
The GPS receiver detects radio signals from nearby GPS satellites.
There are precise clocks on each satellite and in the receiver.
The receiver measures the time for radio signals from satellites to reach it.
The receiver uses the time and the speed of radio signals to calculate the distance between the receiver and the satellite.
The receiver does this with at least four different satellites to locate its position on the Earth’s surface ( Figure above ).
GPS receivers are now being built into many items, such as cell phones and cars.
