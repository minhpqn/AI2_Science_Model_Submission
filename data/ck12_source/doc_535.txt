Type 1 diabetes makes up about 5-10% of all cases of diabetes in the United States.
Type 2 diabetes accounts for most of the other cases.
Both types of diabetes are more likely in people that have certain genes.
Having a family member with diabetes increases the risk of developing the disease.
Either type of diabetes can increase the chances of having other health problems.
For example, people with diabetes are more likely to develop heart disease and kidney disease.
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are similar in these ways.
However, the two types of diabetes have different causes.
Type 1 Diabetes
Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks normal cells of the pancreas.
Since the cells in the pancreas are damaged, the pancreas cannot make insulin.
Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence.
People with type 1 diabetes must frequently check the sugar in their blood.
They use a meter to monitor their blood sugar ( Figure below ).
Whenever their blood sugar starts to get too high, they need a shot of insulin.
The insulin brings their blood sugar back to normal.
There is no cure for type 1 diabetes.
Therefore, insulin shots must be taken for life.
Most people with this type of diabetes learn how to give themselves insulin shots.
A blood sugar meter is used to quickly measure blood sugar levels for people with diabetes
