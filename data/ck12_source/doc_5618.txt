Again, another measurer may report the length to be 2.54 cm or 2.56 cm.
In this case, there are two certain digits (the 2 and the 5), with the hundredths digit being uncertain.
Clearly, the top ruler is a superior ruler for measuring lengths as precisely as possible.
Uncertainty exists in all measurements.
The degree of uncertainty is affected in part by the quality of the measuring tool.
Read the material at the link below and answer the questions on the web site:
What is uncertainty in measurements?
Why is the top ruler more reliable in measuring length than the bottom ruler?
How could the top ruler be made more accurate?
uncertainty: lack of sureness about something.
Define significant figures.
Use significant figure rules to express numerical values correctly.
Speed limits have uncertainty built into it
How fast do you drive?
As you enter the town of Jacinto City, Texas, the sign below tells you that the speed limit is 30 miles per hour.
But what if you happen to be driving 31 miles an hour?
Are you in trouble?
Probably not, because there is a certain amount of leeway built into enforcing the regulation.
Most speedometers do not measure the vehicle speed very accurately and could easily be off by a mile or so (on the other hand, radar measurements are much more accurate).
So, a couple of miles/hour difference wonâ€™t matter that much.
