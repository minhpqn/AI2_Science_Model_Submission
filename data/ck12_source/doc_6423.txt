equivalence point:
The point in a neutralization reaction where the number of moles of hydrogen ions is equal to the number of moles of hydroxide ions.
indicator:
A substance that has a distinctly different color when in an acidic or basic solution.
standard solution:
The solution in a titration whose concentration is known.
titration:
An experiment where a volume of a solution of known concentration is added to a volume of another solution in order to determine its concentration.
Perform calculations to determine concentration of unknown acid or base.
The calculation of saponification number in the production of soap is typically found through titration
How is soap made?
The manufacture of soap requires a number of chemistry techniques.
One necessary piece of information is the saponification number.
This is the amount of base needed to hydrolyze a certain amount of fat to produce the free fatty acids that are an essential part of the final product.
The fat is heated with a known amount of base (usually NaOH or KOH).
After hydrolysis is complete, the left-over base is titrated to determine how much was needed to hydrolyze the fat sample.
At the equivalence point in a neutralization, the moles of acid are equal to the moles of base.
\text{moles acid} = \text{moles base}
Recall that the molarity  (M) of a solution is defined as the moles of the solute divided by the liters of solution (L) .
So the moles of solute are therefore equal to the molarity of a solution multiplied by the volume in liters.
