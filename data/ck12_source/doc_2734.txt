All of the items have something in common.
Can you guess what it is?
They all involve carbon compounds known as hydrocarbons.
What Are Hydrocarbons?
Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen.
Hydrocarbons are the simplest type of carbon-based compounds, but they can vary greatly in size.
The smallest hydrocarbons have just one or two carbon atoms.
The largest hydrocarbons may have thousands of carbon atoms.
Q:
