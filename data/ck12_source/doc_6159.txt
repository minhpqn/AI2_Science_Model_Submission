The solution equilibrium for the dissolving of sodium chloride can be represented by one of two equations.
\text{NaCl}(s) \rightleftarrows \text{NaCl}(aq)
While this shows the change of state back and forth between solid and aqueous solution, the preferred equation also shows the dissociation that occurs as an ionic solid dissolves.
\text{NaCl}(s) \rightleftarrows \text{Na}^+ (aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq)
When the solution equilibrium point is reached and no more solute will dissolve, the solution is said to be saturated.
A saturated solution is a solution that contains the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved.
At 20Â°C, the maximum amount of NaCl that will dissolve in 100. g of water is 36.0 g.
If any more NaCl is added past that point, it will not dissolve because the solution is saturated.
What if more water is added to the solution instead?
Now more NaCl would be capable of dissolving in the additional solvent.
An unsaturated solution is a solution that contains less than the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved.
Figure below illustrates the above process and shows the distinction between unsaturated and saturated.
A solution that can no longer dissolve solute is saturated
When 30.0 g of NaCl is added to 100 ml of water, it all dissolves, forming an unsaturated solution.
When 40.0 g is added, 36.0 g dissolves and 4.0 g remains undissolved, forming a saturated solution.
How can you tell if a solution is saturated or unsaturated?
If more solute is added and it does not dissolve, then the original solution was saturated.
If the added solute dissolves, then the original solution was unsaturated.
A solution that has been allowed to reach equilibrium but which has extra undissolved solute at the bottom of the container must be saturated.
Saturated and unsaturated solutions are defined.
