Most other substances are broken down further in the small intestine before they are absorbed.
The stomach stores food until the small intestine is ready to receive it.
A circular muscle controls the opening between the stomach and small intestine.
When the small intestine is empty, the muscle relaxes.
This lets food pass from the stomach into the small intestine.
The small intestine a is narrow tube that starts at the stomach and ends at the large intestine ( Figure above ).
In adults, the small intestine is about 23 feet long.
Chemical digestion takes place in the first part of the small intestine.
Many enzymes and other chemicals are secreted here.
The small intestine is also where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood.
The later sections of the small intestines are covered with tiny projections called villi ( Figure below ).
Villi contain very tiny blood vessels.
Nutrients are absorbed into the blood through these tiny vessels.
There are millions of villi, so, altogether, there is a very large area for absorption to take place.
In fact, villi make the inner surface area of the small intestine 1,000 times larger than it would be without them.
The entire inner surface area of the small intestine is about as big as a basketball court!
The small intestine is lined with tiny villi that help absorb nutrients
This is what the villi lining the intestine looks like when magnified.
Each one is actually only about 1 millimeter long.
Villi are just barely visible with the unaided eye.
