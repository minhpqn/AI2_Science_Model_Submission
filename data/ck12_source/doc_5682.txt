What are waves?
Waves can come in many sizes.
Here we see a large wave crashing on the beach.
Other waves can be very small and regular.
We normally think of waves as being made of water, but there are forms of energy that take on the characteristics of waves.
The idea of a wave has played a major role in our understanding of how the atom is put together and why it behaves the way it does.
Properties of Light
The nuclear atomic model proposed by Rutherford was a great improvement over previous models, but was still not complete.
It did not fully explain the location and behavior of the electrons in the vast space outside of the nucleus.
In fact, it was well known that oppositely charged particles attract one another.
Rutherford’s model did not explain why the electrons don’t simply move toward and eventually collide with the nucleus.
Experiments in the early twentieth century began to focus on the absorption and emission of light by matter.
These studies showed how certain phenomena associated with light reveal insight into the nature of matter, energy, and atomic structure.
Wave Nature of Light
In order to begin to understand the nature of the electron, we first need to look at the properties of light.
