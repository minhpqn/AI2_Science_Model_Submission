Common examples of simple sugars or monosaccharides are glucose and fructose.
Both of these monosaccharides are referred to as hexoses since they have six carbons.
Glucose is abundant in many plant sources and makes up sweetners such as corn sugar or grape sugar.
Fructose occurs in a great many fruits and is also found in honey.
These sugars are structural isomers of one another, with the difference being that glucose contains an aldehyde functional group whereas fructose contains a ketone functional group.
Linear forms of monosaccharides glucose and fructose
Glucose and fructose are monosaccharides, or simple sugars.
Glucose and fructose are both very soluble in water.
In aqueous solution, the predominant forms are not the straight-chain structure shown above.
Rather, they adopt a cyclic structure (see Figure below ).
Glucose is a six-membered ring, while fructose is a five-membered ring.
Both rings contain an oxygen atom.
Cyclic form of monosaccharides glucose and fructose
The cyclic form of sugars is the favored form in aqueous solution.
Another important group of monosaccharides are the pentoses, containing five carbons in the chain.
Ribose and deoxyribose are two pentoses that are components of the structures of DNA and RNA.
