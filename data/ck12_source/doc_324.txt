Essentially, it "shuts off" or "turns on" a system when it varies from a set value.
For example, your body has an internal thermostat.
During a winter day, in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds by turning on or off the heater.
Your body acts in much the same way.
When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense the temperature change.
The temperature change triggers a command from the brain.
This command can cause several responses.
If you are too hot, the skin makes sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate.
This response helps decrease body temperature.
Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels.
When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver.
As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced.
When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose.
Negative feedback regulation is used to regulate the temperature of the body
Feedback Regulation.
If a raise in body temperature (stimulus) is detected (receptor), a signal will cause the brain to maintain homeostasis (response).
Once the body temperature returns to normal, negative feedback will cause the response to end.
This sequence of stimulus-receptor-signal-response is used throughout the body to maintain homeostasis.
Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback.
Positive feedback is when a response to an event increases the likelihood of the event to continue.
