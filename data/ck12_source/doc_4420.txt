Is this kangaroo a placental mammal?
You know that female kangaroos have a pouch for the final development of their babies.
So, no, kangaroos are not placental mammals.
What is a placental mammal?
Like other female vertebrates, all female mammals have ovaries .
These are the organs that produce eggs (see Figure below ).
Therian mammals also have two additional female reproductive structures that are not found in other vertebrates.
They are the uterus and vagina.
The uterus (plural, uteri) is a pouch-like, muscular organ.
The embryo or fetus develops inside the uterus.
Muscular contractions of the uterus push the offspring out during birth.
The vagina is a tubular passageway through which the embryo or fetus leaves the motherâ€™s body during birth.
The vagina is also where the male deposits sperm during mating.
Reproductive system of a Therian Mammal
Female Reproductive System of a Therian Mammal (Human).
Therian mammals are viviparous , giving birth to an embryo or infant rather than laying eggs.
The female reproductive system of all therian mammals is similar to that of humans.
Therian mammals are divided into two groups: placental mammals and marsupial mammals.
Each group has a somewhat different reproductive strategy.
Placental mammals are therian mammals in which a placenta develops during pregnancy.
