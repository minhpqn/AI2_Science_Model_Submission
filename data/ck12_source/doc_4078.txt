The same fungi cause athlete’s foot when they infect the skin between the toes.
Athlete’s foot is the second most common skin disease in the U.S.
Figure below shows signs of these two infections.
Ringworm and athlete's foot are fungal diseases
Ringworm produces a ring-shaped rash, but it isn’t caused by a worm.
It’s caused by the same fungus that causes athlete’s foot.
Mold allergies are very common.
They are caused by airborne mold spores.
When the spores enter the respiratory tract, the immune system responds to them as though they were harmful microbes.
Symptoms may include sneezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
The symptoms are likely to be more severe in people with asthma or other respiratory diseases.
Long-term exposure to mold spores may also weaken the immune system.
Molds grow indoors as well as out.
Indoors, they grow in showers, basements, and other damp places.
Homes damaged in floods and hurricanes may have mold growing just about everywhere (see Figure below ).
Indoor mold may cause more health problems than outdoor mold because of the closed, confined space.
Most people also spend more time indoors than out.
Indoor mold can be harmful to human health
The mold growing on the walls and ceiling of this storm-damaged home may be harmful to human health.
Fungi cause three different types of human illness: poisonings, parasitic infections, and allergies.
