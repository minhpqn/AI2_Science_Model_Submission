The hydroxide ion that is produced as a result of the above reaction makes the solution slightly basic.
Salt hydrolysis is a reaction in which one of the ions from a salt reacts with water, forming either an acidic or basic solution.
Salts That Form Basic Solutions
When solid sodium fluoride is dissolved into water, it completely dissociates into sodium ions and fluoride ions.
The sodium ions do not have any capability of hydrolyzing, but the fluoride ions hydrolyze to produce a small amount of hydrofluoric acid and hydroxide ion.
\text{F}^-(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{HF}(aq)+\text{OH}^-(aq)
Salts that are derived from the neutralization of a weak acid (HF) by a strong base (NaOH) will always produce salt solutions that are basic.
Salts That Form Acidic Solutions
Ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) is a salt that is formed when the strong acid HCl is neutralized by the weak base NH 3 .
Ammonium chloride is soluble in water.
The chloride ion produced is incapable of hydrolyzing because it is the conjugate base of the strong acid HCl.
In other words, the Cl − ion cannot accept a proton from water to form HCl and OH − , as the fluoride ion did in the previous section.
However, the ammonium ion is capable of reacting slightly with water, donating a proton and so acting as an acid.
\text{NH}^+_4(aq)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftarrows \text{H}_3\text{O}^+(aq)+\text{NH}_3(aq)
Salts That Form Neutral Solutions
A salt that is derived from the reaction of a strong acid with a strong base forms a solution that has a pH of 7.
An example is sodium chloride, formed from the neutralization of HCl by NaOH.
A solution of NaCl in water has no acidic or basic properties, since neither ion is capable of hydrolyzing.
Other salts that form neutral solutions include potassium nitrate (KNO 3 ) and lithium bromide (LiBr).
The T able below summarizes how to determine the acidity or basicity of a salt solution.
