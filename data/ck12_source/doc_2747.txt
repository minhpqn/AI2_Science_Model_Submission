A:
Each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds.
Carbon atoms always form four covalent bonds, regardless of the atoms to which it bonds.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more triple bonds are called alkynes .
The names of specific alkynes always end in â€“yne and have a prefix for the number of carbon atoms.
The structural formula in the Figure below represents the smallest alkyne, named ethyne, which has two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms (C 2 H 2 ).
Ethyne is also called acetylene.
It is burned in acetylene torches, like the one pictured in the Figure below .
The flame of an acetylene torch is so hot that it can melt metal.

Application of acetylene(ethyne)
Cutting metal with an acetylene (ethyne) torch.
Alkynes may form straight or branched chains.
They rarely occur in ring shapes.
In fact, alkynes of all shapes are relatively rare in nature.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons with at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms.
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with at least one double bond between carbon atoms.
Aromatic hydrocarbons are unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons with alternating single and double bonds between carbon atoms.
Alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with at least one triple bond between carbon atoms.
Draw a plan for a three-dimensional model of an unsaturated hydrocarbon molecule.
