Along with physical changes, what else changes during adolescence?
Adulthood and Aging
Distinguish early adulthood from middle adulthood and from late adulthood.
Describe changes that begin in middle adulthood.
Summarize issues associated with late adulthood.
What does adulthood mean to you?
You might think sometimes that you can't wait to be an adult!
In adulthood you have greater freedom, but you also have greater responsibilities.
Like this man, you might have a house and children to take care of.
When is a person considered an adult?
That depends.
Most teens become physically mature by the age of 16 or so.
But they are not adults in a legal sense until they are older.
For example, in the U.S., you must be 18 to vote.
Once adulthood begins, it can be divided into three stages: (1) early, (2) middle, and (3) late adulthood.
Early adulthood starts at age 18 or 21.
It continues until the mid-30s.
During early adulthood, people are at their physical peak.
They are also usually in good health.
The ability to have children is greatest during early adulthood, as well.
