Microevolution and Macroevolution
Does evolution only happen gradually through small changes?
Or is it possible that drastic environmental changes can cause new species to evolve?
Or can both small and large changes occur?
Evolutionary changes can be both big and small.
Some evolutionary changes do not create new species, but result in changes at the population level.
A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area ( Figure below ).
But what exactly is the definition of a species?
A species is a group of organisms that have similar characteristics (they are genetically similar) and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring.
This school of fish are members of the same species and population
This school of fish are considered members of the same species because they are able to mate with one another.
They are also considered a population because they live in the same part of the ocean.
You already know that evolution is the change in species over time.
Most evolutionary changes are small and do not lead to the creation of a new species.
When populations change in small ways over time, the process is called microevolution .
Microevolution results in changes within a species.
An example of microevolution is the evolution of mosquitoes that cannot be killed by pesticides, called pesticide-resistant mosquitoes.
Imagine that you have a pesticide that kills most of the mosquitoes in your state.
Through a random mutation, some of the mosquitoes have resistance to the pesticide.
As a result of the widespread use of this pesticide, most of the remaining mosquitoes are the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes.
