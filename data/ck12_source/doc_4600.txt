What happens when your tonsils cause more problems than they solve?
Almost all of us have had a sore throat at some time.
Maybe you had your tonsils out when you were younger?
Why?
Your tonsils are two lumps of tissue that work as germ fighters for your body.
But sometimes germs like to hang out there, where they cause infections.
In other words, your tonsils can cause more problems than they solve.
So, you have them taken out.
Like the immune systems of other vertebrates, the human immune system is adaptive.
If pathogens manage to get through the body’s first two lines of defense, the third line of defense takes over.
The third line of defense is referred to as the immune response .
This defense is specific to a particular pathogen, and it allows the immune system to “remember” the pathogen after the infection is over.
If the pathogen tries to invade the body again, the immune response against that pathogen will be much faster and stronger.
