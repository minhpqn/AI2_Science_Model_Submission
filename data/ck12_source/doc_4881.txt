This membrane surrounds the cell.
So what is its role?
Can molecules enter and leave the cell?
Yes.
Can anything or everything enter or leave?
No.
So, what determines what can go in or out?
Is it the nucleus?
The DNA?
Or the plasma membrane?
The plasma membrane (also called the cell membrane ) is a lipid bilayer that is common to all living cells.
Its function is to keep the cell as a distinct entity in a water-based environment.
A phospholipid bilayer is a double layer of closely-packed phospholipid molecules.
It is this orientation of the phospholipids into the bilayer that biochemically gives the membrane its specific functional characteristics.
Organelle membranes are also composed of phospholipids.
For example, mitochondria are bounded by a double membrane.
Each membrane has a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.
This division from the rest of the cell makes the mitochondria only partially dependent on the cell.
More on the structure of the phospholipid bilayer will be presented in the The Plasma Membrane:
The Phospholipid Bilayer (Advanced) concept.
