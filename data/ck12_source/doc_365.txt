However, it has other important roles in the body.
For example, fiber is important for maintaining the health of your gastrointestinal tract.
Eating foods high in fiber also helps fill you up without providing too many calories.
Most fruits and vegetables are high in fiber.
Some examples are pictured below ( Figure below ).
Fiber is an important part of a healthy diet
Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, girls need about 26 grams of fiber per day, and boys need about 31 grams of fiber per day.
Proteins are nutrients made up of smaller molecules called amino acids .
Recall that there are 20 different amino acids arranged like "beads on a string" to form proteins.
These amino acid chains then fold up into a three-dimensional molecule, giving the protein a specific function.
Proteins have several important roles in the body.
For example, proteins make up antibodies, muscle fibers and enzymes that help control cell and body processes.
You need to make sure you have enough protein in your diet to obtain the necessary amino acids to make your proteins.
If you eat more than you need for these purposes, the extra protein is used for energy.
The image below shows how many grams of protein you need each day ( Figure below ).
It also shows some foods that are good sources of protein.
Milk, chicken, beans, seafood, and eggs are good sources of protein
Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, you need about 34 grams of proteins a day.
Seafood and eggs are other good sources of protein.
Lipids are nutrients, such as fats that store energy.
