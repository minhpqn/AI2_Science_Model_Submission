Raising livestock, for example, produces a lot of methane.
Particulates are solid particles.
These particles may be ash, dust, or even animal wastes.
Many are released when fossil fuels burn.
Secondary pollutants form from primary pollutants.
Many occur as part of photochemical smog .
This type of smog is seen as a brown haze in the air.
Photochemical smog forms when certain pollutants have a chemical reaction in the presence of sunlight.
Photochemical smog consists mainly of ozone (O 3 ).
Ozone near the ground is a pollutant ( Figure below ).
This ozone is harmful to humans and other living things.
However, ozone in the stratosphere protects Earth from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Formation of ozone as a pollutant
Ozone forms near the ground as a secondary pollutant.
Sources of Air Pollutants
Most pollutants enter the air when fossil fuels burn.
Some are released when forests burn.
Others evaporate into the air.
Burning Fossil Fuels
Burning fossil fuels releases many pollutants into the air.
