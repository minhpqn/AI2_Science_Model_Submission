What are the roles of tRNA and rRNA?
Transcription of DNA to RNA
Explain the relationship between a codon and the mRNA.
Describe how mRNA is created from DNA.
How does DNA write its message?
The process of DNA sending a message to the cytoplasm is called transcription.
Transcription means "a written copy." However, DNA can't get out a pen and write a message.
It creates an mRNA molecule to carry the message.
DNA is located in the nucleus.
Proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
Remember that information in a gene is converted into mRNA , which carries the information to the ribosome.
In the nucleus, mRNA is created by using the DNA in a gene as a template.
