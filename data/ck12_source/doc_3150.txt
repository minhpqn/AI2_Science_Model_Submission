A:
Thermal energy is transferred by conduction from the hot iron to the shirt, from the hot cup to the hand holding it, from the flame of the camp stove to the bottom of the pot as well as from the bottom of the pot to the food inside, and from the feet to the snow.
The shirt, hand, pot, food, and snow become warmer because of the transferred energy.
Because the feet lose thermal energy, they feel colder.
Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching.
Thermal energy is always transferred from particles of warmer matter to particles of cooler matter.
When particles of warmer matter collide with particles of cooler matter, they transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles.
