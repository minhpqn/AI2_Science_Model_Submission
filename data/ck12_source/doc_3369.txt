An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy.
You can see a simple diagram of an electric motor in the Figure below .
The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected to a shaft.
When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet rotates, causing the shaft to rotate as well.
The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device.
For example, in an electric fan, the rotating shaft turns the blades of the fan.

Schematic of an electromagnetic motor
Why does the motorâ€™s electromagnet rotate?
The electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets.
When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets.
This causes the electromagnet to rotate toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets.
A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed.
The reversed poles are again repelled by the poles of the permanent magnets, which have not reversed.
This causes the electromagnet to continue to rotate.
These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet rotates continuously.

Electromagnetic devices are devices that contain electromagnets.
Examples of electromagnetic devices include doorbells and any devices that have electric motors, such as electric fans.
The electromagnet in a doorbell attracts the clapper, which hits the bell and makes it ring.
