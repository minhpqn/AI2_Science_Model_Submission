Hydrogen is an example of an element that has isotopes.
Three isotopes of hydrogen are modeled in the Figure below .
Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron and lack a neutron.
These atoms are just called hydrogen.
Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron as well.
These atoms are the isotope named deuterium.
Other hydrogen atoms have two neutrons.
These atoms are the isotope named tritium.

Q:
The mass number of an atom is the sum of its protons and neutrons.
What is the mass number of each isotope of hydrogen shown in the Figure above ?
A:
The mass numbers are: hydrogen = 1, deuterium = 2, and tritium = 3.
For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number.
For example, carbon atoms with the usual 6 neutrons have a mass number of 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12), so they are called carbon-12.
Carbon atoms with 7 neutrons have an atomic mass of 13 (6 protons + 7 neutrons = 13).
These atoms are the isotope called carbon-13.
