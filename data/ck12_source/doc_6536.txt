Hydrocarbons that do not contain the benzene group or a benzene ring.
alkane:  A hydrocarbon in which there are only single covalent bonds.
aromatic hydrocarbons:  Contain one or more benzene rings.
hydrocarbon:  An organic compound that is made up of only carbon and hydrogen.
List the rules for naming branched alkanes.
Use the rules to name branched alkane structures.
Example of a family tree
Who is my great-aunt?
Tracing your family tree can be both fun and exciting.
But, it helps to know the exact names of your family members in order to do this correctly.
Just a first name or middle name or last name is not enough.
A traceable family tree is one in which all relatives are carefully and precisely identified.
After all, you would prefer that great-great-great-uncle to be royalty and not a horse thief.
Beginning with butane, there is an alternate structure possible that is not a straight chain.
The structural formulas below show a structure with a three-carbon chain that has a â€“CH 3 group attached to the middle carbon.
Example of a branched alkane
The name of this molecule is 2-methylpropane.
The molecular formula is still C 4 H 10 , which is the same formula as butane.
A structural isomer is one of multiple molecules that have the same molecular formula, but different structural formulas.
Butane and 2-methylpropane are structural isomers.
