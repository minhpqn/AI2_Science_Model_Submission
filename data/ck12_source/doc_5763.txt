What are alkaline Earth metals?
What are their physical properties?
Why are alkaline Earth metals very reactive?
Compare and contrast the reactivity of beryllium (Be) and barium (Ba).
Identify the noble gases.
List properties of noble gases.
Explain the nonreactivity of noble gases and how it is related to the octet rule.
Okay, helium balloons are light, but theyâ€™re not that light!
This fanciful picture serves to make the point that helium is one of the lightest elements.
Helium belongs to a group of elements called the noble gases.
What Are Noble Gases?
Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table.
As you can see in the periodic table in Figure below , noble gases include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn).
All noble gases are colorless and odorless.
They also have low boiling points, explaining why they are gases at room temperature.
Radon, at the bottom of the group, is radioactive, so it constantly decays to other elements.
