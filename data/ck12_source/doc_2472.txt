Predict what would happen to the water cycle if there were no evaporation.
Define evaporation, and describe how it occurs.
List four factors that influence the rate of evaporation.
What is evaporative cooling?
Why does it happen?
Dorrance mopped the floor and now it is wet.
She wants the floor to dry more quickly, so she plugs in an electric fan, aims it at the floor, and turns it on.
Do you think this will help the floor dry faster?

Describe how condensation occurs.
Relate dew point to condensation.

This beautiful beaded net is something very common in nature: a spider web.
The “beads” on the spider web are actually drops of water.
The drops of water are not raindrops, and they weren’t there on the previous day.
Where did they come from?
From Gas to Liquid
The drops of water on the spider web are dewdrops.
They formed overnight when warm moist air came into contact with the cooler spider web.
Contact with the cooler web cooled the air.
