For example, the mucociliary escalator of the respiratory system is made up of mucus-secreting ciliated cells that line the trachea and bronchi.
These ciliated cells, shown in Figure below , move mucus away from the lungs.
This mucus catches spores, bacteria, and debris and moves to the esophagus, where it is swallowed.

Scanning electron micrograph (SEM), of the cilia protruding from human lung cells.
Right:
Electron micrograph of cross-section of two cilia, showing the positions of the microtubules inside.
Note how there are nine groups of two microtubules (called dimers) in each cilium.
Each dimer is made up of an alpha and a beta tubulin protein that are connected together.
cilia (singular, cilium ):
Short, hairlike projection, similar to flagella, that allows some cells to move.
flagella (singular, flagellum ):
A "tail-like" appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; used for locomotion.
microtubules :
Largest component of the cytoskeleton; hollow protein cylinders made of alpha and beta tubulin; also found in flagella.
Cilia and flagella are extensions of the cell membrane that contain microtubules, and are usually used for movement.
Cilia cover the surface of some single-celled animals, such as paramecium, but cover only one side of cells in some multicellular organisms.
