Moles to Mass Problems
In this type of problem, the amount of one substance is given in moles.
From this, you are to determine the mass of another substance that will either react with or be produced from the given substance.
\text{moles of} \ given \rightarrow \text{moles of} \ unknown \rightarrow \text{mass of} \ unknown
The moles of the given substance are first converted into moles of the unknown by using the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation.
Then, the moles of the unknown are converted into mass in grams by use of the molar mass of that substance from the periodic table.
Sample Problem:
Mole-Mass Stoichiometry
Hydrogen sulfide gas burns in oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide and water vapor.
2\text{H}_2 \text{S}(g) + 3\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{SO}_2(g)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
What mass of oxygen gas is consumed in a reaction that produces 4.60 mol SO 2 ?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
given: 4.60 mol SO 2
2 mol SO 2 = 3 mol O 2 (mole ratio)
molar mass of O 2 = 32.00 g/mol
mass O 2 = ? g
Use the mole ratio to convert from mol SO 2 to mol O 2 .
Then convert mol O 2 to grams.
This will be done in a single two-step calculation.
