Amphibians generally lay large number of eggs.
Often, many adults lay eggs in the same place at the same time.
This helps to ensure that eggs will be fertilized and at least some of the embryos will survive.
Once eggs have been laid, most amphibians are done with their parenting.
The majority of amphibian species go through a larval stage that is very different from the adult form, as you can see from the frog in Figure below .
The early larval, or tadpole , stage resembles a fish.
It lacks legs and has a long tail, which it uses to swim.
The tadpole also has gills to absorb oxygen from water.
As the larva undergoes metamorphosis , it grows legs, loses its tail, and develops lungs.
These changes prepare it for life on land as an adult frog.
Frog development: from tadpole to adult
Frog Development:
From Tadpole to Adult.
A frog larva (tadpole) goes through many changes by adulthood.
Notice the visible changes that occur at each stage.
How do these changes prepare it for life as an adult frog?
Amphibians reproduce sexually with either external or internal fertilization.
Amphibians may attract mates with calls or scents.
Amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs, so they must reproduce in water.
Amphibian larvae go through metamorphosis to change into the adult form.
