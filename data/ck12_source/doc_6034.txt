How are hot air balloons able to move smoothly in the air?
Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons.
Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals.
Others race in competitions.
Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us.
As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside.
When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up.
After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off.
Pressure is defined as the force per unit area on a surface.
When a person stands on the floor, his feet exert pressure on the surface.
That pressure is related to both the mass of the person and the surface area of his feet.
If the person were holding a heavy object, the pressure would increase because of a greater force.
Alternatively, if the person stands on his toes, the pressure also increases because of a decrease in the surface area.
Gas molecules also exert pressure.
Earth’s atmosphere exerts pressure because gravity acts on the huge number of gas particles contained in the atmosphere, holding it in place.
Pressure is also exerted by a small sample of gas, such as that which is contained in a balloon.
Gas pressure is the pressure that results from collisions of gas particles with an object.
Inside the balloon, the gas particles collide with the balloon’s inner walls.
It is those collisions which keep the balloon inflated.
If the gas particles were to suddenly stop moving, the balloon would instantly deflate.
