The Grand Canyon ( Figure below is a good example of lateral continuity.
You can clearly see the same rock layers on opposite sides of the canyon.
The matching rock layers were deposited at the same time, so they are the same age.
Rock layers in the Grand Canyon show lateral continuity
Lateral Continuity.
Layers of the same rock type are found across canyons at the Grand Canyon.
Law of Original Horizontality
Sediments were deposited in ancient seas in horizontal, or flat, layers.
If sedimentary rock layers are tilted, they must have moved after they were deposited.
Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships
Rock layers may have another rock cutting across them, like the igneous rock pictured below ( Figure below ).
Which rock is older?
To determine this, we use the law of cross-cutting relationships.
The cut rock layers are older than the rock that cuts across them.
Cross-cutting relationships in rock layers
Cross-cutting relationships in rock layers.
The rock layers at the bottom are cut off by the rock layers that are higher up.
Which layers are older and which are younger?
Geologists can learn a lot about Earth’s history by studying sedimentary rock layers.
But in some places, there’s a gap in time when no rock layers are present.
