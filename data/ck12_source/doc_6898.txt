What is the period T of oscillation (in seconds) of an electron that is bouncing up and down in response to the passage of a packet of red light?
Is the electron moving rapidly or slowly?
Radio signals are carried by electromagnetic waves (i.e. light waves).
The radio waves from San Francisco radio station KMEL (106.1 FM) have a frequency of 106.1 MHz.
When these waves reach your antenna, your radio converts the motions of the electrons in the antenna back into sound.
What is the wavelength of the signal from KMEL?
What is the wavelength of a signal from KPOO (89.5 FM)?
If your antenna were broken off so that it was only 2 cm long, how would this affect your reception?
a. 1.0s, 1 Hz b. 0.5s, 2 Hz c. 3 m
a. 0.1 Hz, 10.0 s b. 7.5 m/s, 75 m
a.
About 11 years b.
About 2014 (see for more info)
a. 1.7 cm b.17 m
2230 \;\mathrm{Hz}; 2780 \;\mathrm{Hz}; 2970 \;\mathrm{Hz}
a.  4.3 \times 10^{14} \ Hz  b.  2.3 \times 10^{-15} \ s
a. 2.83 m b. 3.35 m c. rule of thumb, antenna should be \frac{1}{4} \lambda , thus quality of reception will suffer
Explain the concept of destructive and constructive interference in the context of beat frequencies.
Students will learn the concept of destructive and constructive interference in the context of beat frequencies.
f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1 -f_2| ; two interfering waves create a beat wave with frequency equal to the difference in their frequencies
