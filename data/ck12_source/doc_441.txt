This process is much more efficient in the presence of oxygen.
Without oxygen, much less ATP is produced.
As ATP is needed for the cells to function properly, every cell in your body needs oxygen.
Getting that oxygen begins with inhaling.
The oxygen moves into your blood, where it travels to every cell in your body.
Oxygen enters the lungs, then passes through the alveoli and into the blood.
The oxygen is carried around the body in blood vessels.
Carbon dioxide moves into the blood capillaries and is brought to the lungs to be released into the air during exhalation.
