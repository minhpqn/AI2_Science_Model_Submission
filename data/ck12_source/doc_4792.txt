The Table above lists the four types of organic compounds, the elements they contain, and examples and functions of each type of compound.
Condensation and Hydrolysis
Condensation reactions are the chemical processes by which large organic compounds are synthesized from their monomeric units.
Hydrolysis reactions are the reverse process.
During condensation reactions, water is produced from the two molecules being bonded together; an H from one monomer is joined to an -OH from another molecule, producing H 2 O.
The ester linkage is between a glycerol molecule and fatty acid chain.

adenosine triphosphate (ATP) :
Energy-carrying molecule that cells use to power their metabolic processes; energy-currency of the cell.
amino acid :
Small molecule that is a building block of proteins; the monomer of a polypeptide.
carbohydrate :
