Would you rather spend a summer day in Phoenix or in Houston?
People who live in Phoenix, Arizona are told that summer isn't so bad because "it's a dry heat." What does that mean?
Imagine that both Phoenix and Houston have a temperature of 90°F.
In Phoenix, the relative humidity is 20%.
In Houston, the relative humidity is 90%.
So in Phoenix it feels like it's 90°.
But in Houston it feels like it's 122!
Of course in Phoenix in July, the average high temperature is 106°.
That's hot, dry or not!
Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air.
