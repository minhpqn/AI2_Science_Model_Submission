These pretty, colorful “ribbons” aren’t leftover ribbons from birthday gifts.
The “ribbons” are a model of a molecule called hemoglobin, which is coursing through your blood vessels right now.
Hemoglobin is a compound that is found in red blood cells and has the crucial job of carrying oxygen to cells throughout the body.
Your life depends on hemoglobin.
Meet the Proteins
Hemoglobin is a compound in the class of compounds called proteins.
Proteins are one of four classes of biochemical compounds, which are compounds in living things. (The other three classes are carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.) Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.
Protein molecules consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids.
Amino acids are the “building blocks” of proteins.
There are 20 different amino acids.
The structural formula of the simplest amino acid, called glycine, is shown in the Figure below .
Other amino acids have slightly different structures.
A protein molecule is made from one or more long chains of amino acids, each linked to its neighbors by covalent bonds.
If a protein has more than one chain, the chains are held together by weaker bonds, such as hydrogen bonds.
