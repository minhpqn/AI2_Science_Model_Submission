What is the unit of intensity of sound?
At what decibel level do sounds start to become harmful to the ears and hearing?
Relate amplitude and distance to the intensity and loudness of sound.
Frequency and Pitch of Sound
Define the pitch of sound.
Relate the pitch of sound to the frequency of sound waves.
Identify infrasound and ultrasound.
A marching band passes you as it parades down the street.
You heard it coming from several blocks away.
Now that the different instruments have finally reached you, their distinctive sounds can be heard.
The tiny piccolos trill their bird-like high notes, and the big tubas rumble out their booming bass notes.
Clearly, some sounds are higher or lower than others.
High or Low
How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its pitch .
Pitch, in turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves.
Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time.
High-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the piccolo in the Figure below , have high-frequency waves.
Low-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the tuba Figure below , have low-frequency waves.

The frequency of a sound wave determines the pitch that we hear.
