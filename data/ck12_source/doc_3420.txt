Assume that you gather evidence by making more observations of moths with eye spots.
Perhaps you observe that birds really do avoid eating moths with eye spots.
This evidence agrees with your prediction.
Evidence that agrees with your prediction supports your hypothesis.
Does such evidence prove that your hypothesis is true?
No; a hypothesis cannot be proven conclusively to be true.
This is because you can never examine all of the possible evidence, and someday evidence might be found that disproves the hypothesis.
Nonetheless, the more evidence that supports a hypothesis, the more likely the hypothesis is to be true.
The last step in a scientific investigation is communicating what you have learned with others.
This is a very important step because it allows others to test your hypothesis.
If other researchers get the same results as yours, they add support to the hypothesis.
However, if they get different results, they may disprove the hypothesis.
When scientists share their results, they should describe their methods and point out any possible problems with the investigation.
For example, while you were observing moths, perhaps your presence scared birds away.
This introduces an error into your investigation.
You got the results you predicted (the birds avoided the moths while you were observing them), but not for the reason you hypothesized.
Other researchers might be able to think of ways to avoid this error in future studies.
