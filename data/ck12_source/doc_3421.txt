Why I do Science
Dan Costa, Ph.D. is a professor of Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and has been studying marine life for well over 40 years.
He is a leader in using satellite tags, time and depth recorders and other sophisticated electronic tags to gather information about the amazing depths to which elephant seals dive, their migration routes and how they use oceanographic features to hunt for prey as far as the international dateline and the Alaskan Aleutian Islands.
In the following KQED video, Dr.

At the heart of science is the scientific investigation, which is done by following the scientific method.

Observations often lead to questions.
A hypothesis is a possible logical answer to a scientific question, based on scientific knowledge.
A prediction is a statement that tells what will happen under certain conditions.
