compound:
A substance that contains two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed proportion.
Define chemical change.
Give examples of chemical changes.
Cooking food involves chemical changes
Do you like to cook?
Cooking is a valuable skill that everyone should have.
Whether it is fixing a simple grilled cheese sandwich or preparing an elaborate meal, cooking demonstrates some basic ideas in chemistry.
When you bake bread, you mix some flour, sugar, yeast, and water together.
After baking, this mixture has been changed to form bread, another substance that has different characteristics and qualities from the original materials.
The process of baking has produced chemical changes in the ingredients that result in bread being made.
Most of the elements we know about do not exist freely in nature.
Sodium cannot be found by itself (unless we prepare it in the laboratory) because it interacts easily with other materials.
On the other hand, the element helium does not interact with other elements to any extent.
We can isolate helium from natural gas during the process of drilling for oil.
A chemical change produces a different materials than the ones we started with.
One aspect of the science of chemistry is the study of the changes that matter undergoes.
If all we had were the elements and they did nothing, life would be very boring (in fact, life would not exist since the elements are what make up our bodies and sustain us).
But the processes of change that take place when different chemicals are combined produce all the materials that we use daily.
One type of chemical change (already mentioned) is when two elements combine to form a compound.
