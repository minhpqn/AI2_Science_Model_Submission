These kidney beans are named after a very important organ in your body.
Though you probably can live without these beans, you can't live without at least one kidney.
The kidneys have several essential functions.
For example, kidneys filter your blood, removing wastes and regulating the amount of water in your body.
The kidneys ( Figure below ) are important organs in maintaining homeostasis , the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing environment.
Kidneys perform a number of homeostatic functions.
They maintain the volume of body fluids.
They maintain the balance of salt ions in body fluids.
They excrete harmful nitrogen-containing molecules, such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid.
This illustrations shows the parts of a kidney
Structures of the kidney; fluid leaks from the capillaries and into the nephrons where the fluid forms urine then moves to the ureter and on to the bladder.
There are many blood vessels in the kidneys ( Figure above ).
The kidneys remove urea and other wastes from the blood through tiny filtering units called nephrons.
Nephrons ( Figure below ) are tiny, tube-shaped structures found inside each kidney.
Each kidney has up to a million nephrons.
Each nephron collects a small amount of fluid and waste from a small group of capillaries.
Nitrogen-containing wastes, together with water and other wastes, form the urine as it passes through the nephrons and the kidney.
The fluid within nephrons is carried out into a larger tube in the kidney called a ureter , which carries it to the bladder ( Figure below ).
The kidneys never stop filtering waste products from the blood, so they are always producing urine.
The amount of urine your kidneys produce is dependent on the amount of fluid in your body.
