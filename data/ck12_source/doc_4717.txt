it must be consistent with a pre-existing theory.
The pre-existing theory must have been experimentally verified, though it may often show a pre-existing theory to be wrong in an exact sense,
it must be supported by many strands of evidence rather than a single foundation, ensuring that it is a good approximation or even completely correct.
Also, a theory is generally only taken seriously if it:
allows for changes to be made as new data is discovered, rather than claiming absolute certainty,
is the most straight forward explanation, and makes the fewest assumptions about a phenomenon (commonly called “passing the Occam's razor test”).
This is true of such established theories as those of special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics, plate tectonics, and evolution.
Theories considered scientific ideally meet all of these extra criteria as well.
In summary, to meet the status of a scientific theory, the theory must be falsifiable or testable.
Examples of scientific theories in different areas of science include:
Astronomy :
Big Bang Theory
Biology :
Cell Theory;
Theory of Evolution;
Germ Theory of Disease
Chemistry :
Atomic Theory;
Kinetic Theory of Gases
Physics :
