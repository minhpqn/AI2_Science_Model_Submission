When they pay me, they give me a $20 bill.
It doesn’t matter whether the bill is brand new or old, dirty, and wrinkled – all these bills have the same value of $20.
If I want more $20 bills, I have to mow more lawns.
I can’t say, “This particular bill is actually worth more than $20.” To have more money, I have to put in more work.
Extensive and Intensive Properties
Some properties of matter depend on the size of the sample, while some do not.
An extensive property is a property that depends on the amount of matter in a sample.
The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter that an object contains.
A small sample of a certain type of matter will have a small mass, while a larger sample will have a greater mass.
Another extensive property is volume .
The volume of an object is a measure of the space that is occupied by that object.
