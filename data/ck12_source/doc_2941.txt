In the gene therapy treatment for this disorder, bone marrow stem cells were taken from the girl’s body, and the missing gene was inserted into these cells outside the body.
Then the modified cells were put back into her bloodstream.
This treatment successfully restored the function of her immune system, but only with repeated treatments.
