Most invertebrates reproduce sexually.
Diploid adults produce haploid gametes (sperm and eggs).
In some species, the same individuals produce both sperm and eggs.
In other species, sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female individuals.
Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid zygote.
The zygote develops into an embryo and eventually into a new adult organism.
On the way, it may pass through one or more larval stages.
A larva (plural, larvae) is a juvenile, or immature, stage of an animal.
It is generally quite different in form and function from the adult form of the species.
For example, the larva may be able to swim freely, whereas the adult must remain permanently attached to a solid surface.
Some invertebrates can also reproduce asexually.
This may occur by fission or budding.
Fission takes place when an animal simply divides into two parts.
Each part then regrows the missing part.
The result is two whole organisms.
Budding may take place when a parent forms a small bump, or bud.
The bud remains attached to the parent while it develops into a new individual.
The majority of living animals are invertebrates.
Invertebrates lack a backbone.
Invertebrates may have an incomplete or a complete digestive system.
