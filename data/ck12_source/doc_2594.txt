Lanthanides are relatively reactive for transition metals, and actinides are radioactive.
At the following URL, click on any two of the transition metals and read about their properties, atomic structure, discovery, and uses.
Then write a paragraph comparing and contrasting the two elements.
What are transition metals?
Describe properties of transition metals.
How do transition metals differ from metals in groups 1 and 2?
How are they different from all other elements?
Identify the lanthanides and actinides.
Groups with Metalloids
Identify elements in groups 13–16 of the periodic table.
List properties of a metalloid from each of these groups.
This image represents a famous ancient Egyptian named Tutankhamen.
Do you see his heavy eyeliner?
Most likely the eyeliner was made of a mineral containing antimony.
This metalloid was commonly used for makeup by Egyptians between four and five thousand years ago.
Today we know that antimony is toxic, although Tutankhamen probably didn’t know that.
Antimony is found in group 15 of the periodic table.
Group 15 is one of four groups of the periodic table that contain metalloids.
Groups 13–16 of the periodic table (orange in the Figure below ) are the only groups that contain elements classified as metalloids.
Unlike other groups of the periodic table, which contain elements in just one class, groups 13–16 contain elements in at least two different classes.
