These groups are not necessarily the same as the traditional groups based on structure and function.
The supertree classification places placental mammals in four superorders .
The four superorders and some of the mammals in them are:
Afrotheria—aardvarks, elephants, manatees.
Xenarthra—anteaters, sloths, armadillos.
Laurasiatheria—bats, whales, hoofed mammals, carnivores.
Supraprimates—primates, rabbits, rodents.
All four superorders appear to have become distinct from one another between 85 and 105 million years ago.
The exact relationships among the superorders are still not clear.
Revisions in this classification of mammals may occur as new data become available.
Mammals used to be classified on the basis of similarities in structure and function into 17 different orders.
Recently, DNA analyses have shown that the traditional orders include mammals that are not closely related.
Phylogenetic classification, based on DNA data, groups placental mammals in four superorders.
The superorders appear to have become distinct from each other 85–105 million years ago.
