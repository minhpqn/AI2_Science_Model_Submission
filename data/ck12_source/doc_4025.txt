This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.
Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses.
They are relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to treat infections.
Most of the antiviral drugs now available are designed to help deal with HIV and herpes viruses.
Antivirals are also available for the influenza viruses and the Hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause liver cancer.
Antiviral drugs are often imitation DNA building blocks which viruses incorporate into their genomes during replication.
The life cycle of the virus is then halted because the newly synthesized DNA is inactive.
Similar to antibiotics, antivirals are subject to drug resistance as the pathogens evolve to survive exposure to the treatment.
HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion.
Researchers are now working to extend the range of antivirals to other families of pathogens .
Several viral diseases can be treated with antiviral drugs or prevented with vaccines.
