They usually have large divided leaves called fronds.
In most ferns, fronds develop from a curled-up formation called a fiddlehead ( Figure below ).
The fiddlehead looks like the curled decoration on the end of a stringed instrument, such as a fiddle.
Leaves unroll as the fiddleheads grow and expand.
Ferns grow in a variety of habitats, ranging in size from tiny aquatic species to giant tropical plants.

Horsetails have hollow, ribbed stems and are often found in marshes ( Figure below ).
Whorls of tiny leaves around the stem make the plant look like a horse's tail, but these soon fall off and leave a hollow stem that can perform photosynthesis.
This is unusual since photosynthesis most often occurs in leaves.
The stems are rigid and rough to the touch because they are coated with a scratchy mineral.
Because of their scratchy texture, these plants were once used as scouring pads for cleaning dishes.

Whisk ferns have green branching stems with no leaves, so they resemble a whisk broom ( Figure below ).
Another striking feature of the whisk ferns is its spherical yellow sporangia.
