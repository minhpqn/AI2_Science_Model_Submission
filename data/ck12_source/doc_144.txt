Mammals also do work for us.
Service dogs can be trained to help the disabled.
These include guide dogs, which are assistance dogs trained to lead blind and visually impaired people around obstacles.
Horses and elephants can carry heavy loads.
Humans also use some mammals for food.
For example, cows and goats are commonly raised for their milk and meat.
Mammals’ more highly developed brains have made them ideal for use by scientists in studying such things as learning, as seen in maze studies of mice and rats.

Mammals have also played a significant role in different cultures’ folklore and religion.
For example, the grace and power of the cougar have been admired in the cultures of the native peoples of the Americas.
The Inca city of Cuzco is designed in the shape of a cougar, and the thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal.
In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of several American Indian tribes.
Important mammals include Dolly the sheep, Lassie the dog, and flipper the dolphin.
Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic (body) cell, using the process of nuclear transfer.
Lassie was a collie dog who appeared in seven full length feature films in the 1940s and 1950s, starting with Lassie Come Home in 1943.
Additional Lassie movies were made as recently as 2005.
Between 1954 and 1973, the Lassie television series aired, with plenty of additional productions as recently as 2007.
Flipper was a bottle nose dolphin that starred in a television series between 1964 and 1967.
The most famous mammal may be King Kong, the giant gorilla that terrorized New York City in 1933 in the movie of the same name.
