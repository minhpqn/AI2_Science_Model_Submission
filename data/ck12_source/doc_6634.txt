If you did, you were using conditioning.
Another example of conditioning is shown in the video below; the rats have been taught to “play basketball” by being rewarded with food pellets.
What do you think would happen if the rats were no longer rewarded for this behavior?

Conditioning also occurs in wild animals.
For example, bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those flowers before.
Humans learn behaviors through conditioning, as well.
A young child might learn to put away his toys by being rewarded with a bedtime story.
An older child might learn to study for tests in school by being rewarded with better grades.
Can you think of behaviors you have learned by being rewarded for them?
Conditioning does not always involve a reward.
It can involve a punishment, instead.
A toddler might be punished with a time-out each time he grabs a toy from his baby brother.
After several time-outs, he may learn to stop taking his brother’s toys.
A dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa.
After repeated scolding, she may learn to stay off the sofa.
A bird might become ill after eating a poisonous insect.
The bird may learn from this “punishment” to avoid eating the same kind of insect in the future.
Learning by Playing
Most young mammals, including humans, like to play.
