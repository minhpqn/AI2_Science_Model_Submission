A colorless solid compound named potassium hydroxide (KOH) forms, and hydrogen gas (H 2 ) is set free.
The equation for the reaction is:
2K + 2H 2 O → 2KOH + H 2
In this reaction, a potassium ion replaces one of the hydrogen atoms in each molecule of water.
Potassium is a highly reactive group 1 alkali metal, so its reaction with water is explosive.

Q:
Find potassium in the periodic table of the elements.
What other element might replace hydrogen in water in a similar replacement reaction?
A:
Another group 1 element, such as lithium or sodium, might be involved in a similar replacement reaction with water.
Double Replacement Reactions
A double replacement reaction occurs when two ionic compounds exchange ions.
This produces two new ionic compounds.
A double replacement reaction can be represented by the general equation:
AB + CD → AD + CB
AB and CD are the two reactant compounds, and AD and CB are the two product compounds that result from the reaction.
During the reaction, the ions B and D change places.
Q:
Could the product compounds be DA and BC?
