The viral mRNA is then translated into viral proteins.
These viral proteins then assemble to form new viral particles.
A reverse-transcribing virus is any virus which replicates using reverse transcription, the formation of DNA from an RNA template.
Some reverse-transcribing viruses have genomes made of single-stranded RNA and use a DNA intermediate to replicate.
Others in this group have genomes that have double-stranded DNA and use an RNA intermediate during genome replication.
The retroviruses, as mentioned above, are included in this group, of which HIV is a member.
Some double-stranded DNA viruses replicate using reverse transcriptase.
The hepatitis B virus is one of these viruses.
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria.
They bind to surface receptor molecules of the bacterial cell and then their genome enters the cell.
The protein coat does not enter the bacteria.
Within a short amount of time, in some cases, just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein.
These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis.
Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane.
With some phages, just over twenty minutes after the phage infects the bacterium, over three hundred phages can be assembled and released from the host.
After infecting a host cell, a virus uses the cellâ€™s machinery and metabolism to produce new copies of itself.
