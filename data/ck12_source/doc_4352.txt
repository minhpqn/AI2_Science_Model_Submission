These are the scales - the skin - of a blue Siamese fighting fish, and they almost look like a piece of art.
They also look like they form a smooth, streamlined skin.
Why is this important to a fish?
Structure and Function in Fish
Fish are aquatic vertebrates.
They make up more than half of all vertebrate species.
They are especially important in the study of vertebrate evolution because several important vertebrate traits evolved in fish.
Fish show great diversity in body size.
They range in length from about 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) to 16 meters (about 53 feet).
Most are ectothermic and covered with scales.
Scales protect fish from predators and parasites and reduce friction with the water.
Multiple, overlapping scales provide a flexible covering that allows fish to move easily while swimming.
Adaptations for Water
Many structures in fish are adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle.
Several are described below and shown in Figure below .
Fish have gills that allow them to “breathe” oxygen in water.
Water enters the mouth, passes over the gills, and exits the body through a special opening.
Gills absorb oxygen from the water as it passes over them.
Fish have a stream-lined body.
They are typically long and narrow, which reduces water resistance when they swim.
