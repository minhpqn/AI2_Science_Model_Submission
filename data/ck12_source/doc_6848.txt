Scientists believe that the extinction of large quantities of echinoderms has caused this destruction ( Figure below ).
A die-off of the sea urchin in the Caribbean Sea coincided with increases in algal growth
A large die-off of the sea urchin, Diadema antillarum , in the Caribbean Sea coincided with increases in algal growth in some areas but not others.
Echinoderms as Food
In some countries, echinoderms are considered delicacies.
Around 50,000 tons of sea urchins are captured each year for food.
They are consumed mostly in Japan, Peru, Spain and France.
Both male and female gonads of sea urchins are also consumed.
The taste is described as soft and melting, like a mixture of seafood and fruit.
Sea cucumbers are considered a delicacy in some southeastern Asian countries.
In China they are used as a basis for gelatinous soups and stews.
Echinoderms as Medicine
Echinoderms are also used as medicine and in scientific research.
For example, some sea cucumber toxins slow down the growth rate of tumor cells, so there is an interest in using these in cancer research.
Sea urchins are also model organisms used in developmental biology research.
Sea urchins have been used to study the mechanisms of fertilization and egg activation, physiological processes that occur during early development, and the regulation of differentiation in the early embryo.
In addition, the molecular basis of early development was studied in sea urchins.
Gametes can be obtained easily, sterility is not required, and the eggs and early embryos of many commonly used species are beautifully transparent.
In addition, the early development of sea urchin embryos is a highly conserved process.
When a batch of eggs is fertilized, all of the resulting embryos typically develop at the same time.
