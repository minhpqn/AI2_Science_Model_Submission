Determining the limiting reactant requires that all mass quantities first be converted to moles to evaluate the equation.
Carry out the calculations on the problem set at the link below:
Why do all mass values need to be converted to moles before determining the limiting reactant?
If we used 0.7 moles Ag, would it still be the limiting reactant?
If we ran the reaction using the original amounts of Ag and S and had 5.22 grams S left over, what might we assume about the reaction?

It is best to have high yields for chemical reactions
Can we save some money?
The world of pharmaceutical production is an expensive one.
Many drugs have several steps in their synthesis and use costly chemicals.
A great deal of research takes place to develop better ways to make drugs faster and more efficiently.
Studying how much of a compound is produced in any given reaction is an important part of cost control.
Chemical reactions in the real world donâ€™t always go exactly as planned on paper.
In the course of an experiment, many things will contribute to the formation of less product than would be predicted.
Besides spills and other experimental errors, there are usually losses due to an incomplete reaction, undesirable side reactions, etc.
Chemists need a measurement that indicates how successful a reaction has been.
