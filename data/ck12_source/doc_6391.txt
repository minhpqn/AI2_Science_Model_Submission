When a substance that is acting as a Brønsted-Lowry acid donates its proton, it becomes a base in the reverse reaction.
In the reaction above, the hydrogen sulfate ion (HSO 4 − ) donates a proton to water and becomes a sulfate ion (SO 4 2− ).
The HSO 4 − and the SO 4 2− are linked to one another by the presence or absence of the H + ion.
A conjugate acid-base pair is a pair of substances related by the loss or gain of a single hydrogen ion.
A conjugate acid is the particle produced when a base accepts a proton.
The hydrogen sulfate ion is the conjugate acid of the sulfate ion.
A conjugate base is the particle produced when an acid donates a proton.
The sulfate ion is the conjugate base of the hydrogen sulfate ion.
In the reaction illustrated below, water serves both as acid and base simultaneously.
One water molecule serves as an acid and donates a proton.
The other water molecule functions as a base by accepting the proton.
Water self-ionizes to form a Bronsted acid/base pair
Water molecules as a conjugate acid-base pair.
A typical Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction contains two conjugate acid-base pairs as shown below.
\text{HNO}_2(aq)+\text{PO}_4^{3-}(aq) \rightleftarrows \text{NO}_2^-(aq)+\text{HPO}_4^{2-}(aq)
One conjugate acid-base pair is HNO 2 / NO 2 − , while the other pair is HPO 4 2− / PO 4 3− .
Conjugate acids and bases are defined.
Examples of conjugate acid-base pairs are given.
