12.01 \ \text{amu} + 2(16.00 \ \text{amu})=44.01 \ \text{amu}
The molecular mass of a compound is the mass of one molecule of that compound.  The molecular mass of carbon dioxide is 44.01 amu.
The molar mass of any compound is the mass in grams of one mole of that compound.  One mole of carbon dioxide molecules has a mass of 44.01 g, while one mole of sodium sulfide formula units has a mass of 78.04 g.  The molar masses are 44.01 g/mol and 78.04 g/mol respectively.  In both cases, that is the mass of 6.02 × 10 23 representative particles.  The representative particle of CO 2 is the molecule, while for Na 2 S, it is the formula unit.
Sample Problem:  Molar Mass of  a Compound
Calcium nitrate, Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , is used as a component in fertilizer Determine the molar mass of calcium nitrate.
Step 1:  List the known and unknown quantities and plan the problem.
formula = Ca(NO 3 ) 2
molar mass Ca = 40.08 g/mol
molar mass N = 14.01 g/mol
molar mass O = 16.00 g/mol
molar mass Ca(NO 3 ) 2
First we need to analyze the formula.  Since the Ca lacks a subscript, there is one Ca atom per formula unit.  The 2 outside the parentheses means that there are two nitrate ions per formula unit and each nitrate ion consists of one nitrogen atom and three oxygen atoms.
Therefore, there are a total of 1 × 2 = 2 nitrogen atoms and 3 × 2 = 6 oxygen atoms per formula unit.  Thus, 1 mol of calcium nitrate contains 1 mol of Ca atoms, 2 mol of N atoms, and 6 mol of O atoms.
Step 2:  Calculate.
Use the molar masses of each atom together with the number of atoms in the formula and add together.
& 1 \ \text{mol Ca} \times \frac{40.08 \ \text{g Ca}}{1 \ \text{mol Ca}}=40.08 \ \text{g Ca} \\& 2 \ \text{mol N} \times \frac{14.01 \ \text{g N}}{1 \ \text{mol N}}=28.02 \ \text{g N} \\& 6 \ \text{mol O} \times \frac{16.00 \ \text{g O}}{1 \ \text{mol O}}=96.00 \ \text{g O} \\& \text{molar mass of } \text{Ca(NO}_3)_2=40.08 \ \text{g} + 28.02 \ \text{g} + 96.00 \ \text{g} = 164.10 \ \text{g} / \text{mol}
Calculations are described for the determination of molar mass of an atom or a compound.
