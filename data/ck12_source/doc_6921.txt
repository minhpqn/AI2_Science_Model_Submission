Be sure to indicate the directions with arrows.
Now take the individual electric field vectors, add them together, and draw the resultant vector.
This is the electric field created by the two charges together.
A proton traveling to the right moves in between the two large plates.
A vertical electric field, pointing downwards with magnitude 3.0 \;\mathrm{N/C} , is produced by the plates.
What is the direction of the force on the proton?
Draw the electric field lines on the diagram.
If the electric field is 3.0 \;\mathrm{N/C} , what is the acceleration of the proton in the region of the plates?
Pretend the force of gravity doesnâ€™t exist; then sketch the path of the proton.
We take this whole setup to another planet.
If the proton travels straight through the apparatus without deflecting, what is the acceleration of gravity on this planet?
A molecule shown by the square object shown below contains an excess of 100 electrons.
What is the direction of the electric field at point A, 2.0 \times 10^{-9} \;\mathrm{m} away?
What is the value of the electric field at point A ?
A molecule of charge 8.0 \ \mu \mathrm{C} is placed at point A .
What are the magnitude and direction of the force acting on this molecule?
