Through photosynthesis, they provide glucose for the ecosystem.
So, can too much algae be a bad thing?
Eutrophication is an over-enrichment of chemical nutrients in a body of water.
Usually these nutrients are the nitrogen and phosphorous found in fertilizers.
Run-off from lawns or farms can wash fertilizers into rivers or coastal waters.
Plants are not the only things that grow more quickly with added fertilizers.
Algae like the excess nutrients in fertilizers too.
When there are high levels of nutrients in the water, algae populations will grow large very quickly.
This leads to overgrowths of algae called algal blooms .
However, these algae do not live very long.
They die and begin to decompose.
This process uses oxygen, removing the oxygen from the water.
Without oxygen, fish and shellfish cannot live, and this results in the death of these organisms ( Figure below ).
Certain types of algal blooms can also create toxins.
These toxins can enter shellfish.
If humans eat these shellfish, then they can get very sick.
These toxins cause neurological problems in humans.
This lake in Venezuela has algae blooms that will eventually kill all life in the lake
Lake Valencia, Venezuela, showing green algal blooms.
How did the algal bloom form?
