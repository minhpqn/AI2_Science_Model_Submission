In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface!
The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect .
As a result, Venus is the hottest planet.
Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is even much hotter than Mercury.
Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F).
That’s hot enough to melt lead!
The surface of Venus is shrouded by thick clouds.
Radar images show a complex surface.
There are volcanoes and craters like those found on other planets and moons.
The surface is not nearly as complex as the surface of Earth.
There are a large number of craters on Venus.
However, there are not nearly as many as on Mercury or the Moon.
So the planet's surface must be fairly young.
This suggests that the planet experiences volcanism and has a hot interior.
Venus has more volcanoes than any other planet.
There are between 100,000 and one million volcanoes on Venus!
Most of the volcanoes are now inactive.
Pictured below is an image made using radar data ( Figure below ).
The volcano is Maat Mons.
Lava beds are in the foreground.
