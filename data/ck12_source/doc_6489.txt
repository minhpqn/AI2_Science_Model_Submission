Additionally, the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases.
When the car is running normally, its generator recharges the battery by forcing the above reactions to run in the opposite, or nonspontaneous direction.
2\text{PbSO}_4(s)+2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{Pb}(s)+\text{PbO}_2(s)+4\text{H}^+(aq)+2\text{SO}_4{^{2-}}(aq)
This reaction regenerates the lead, lead(IV) oxide, and sulfuric acid needed for the battery to function properly.
Theoretically, a lead storage battery should last forever.
In practice, the recharging is not 100% efficient because some of the lead(II) sulfate falls from the electrodes and collects on the bottom of the cells.
Construction of a dry cell and a battery are given.
Chemical reactions for both types are described.
