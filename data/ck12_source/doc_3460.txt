Which lipid is the main component of cell membranes?
Describe the composition of a protein.
Distinguish between the four levels of protein structure.
Summarize significant protein functions.
You may have been told proteins are good for you.
Do these look good to you?
Proteins as food.
To you, these may not look appetizing (or they might), but they do provide a nice supply of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
Proteins have many important roles, from transporting, signaling, receiving, and catalyzing to storing, defending, and allowing for movement.
Where do you get the amino acids needed so your cells can make their own proteins?
If you cannot make it, you must eat it.
A protein is an organic compound made up of small molecules called amino acids .
There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in the proteins of living organisms.
Small proteins may contain just a few hundred amino acids, whereas large proteins may contain thousands of amino acids.
The largest known proteins are titins, found in muscle, which are composed from over 27,000 amino acids.
A model of the general structure of amino acids
General Structure of Amino Acids.
This model shows the general structure of all amino acids.
Only the side chain, R, varies from one amino acid to another.
For example, in the amino acid glycine, the side chain is simply hydrogen (H).
