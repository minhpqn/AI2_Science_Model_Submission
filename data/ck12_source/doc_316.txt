The amount of potential energy necessary for a phase change to gaseous form is called the heat of vaporization.
The heat gained or lost during a temperature change is given by, Q = mc \Delta t .
The heat gained or lost during a phase change of solid to liquid is given by, Q = mH_f .
The heat gained or lost during a phase change of liquid to gas is given by, Q = mH_v .

For water, which takes more energy, melting or evaporating?
When are there two phases present at the same time in the pot?
Practice problems involving phase changes:
A 200. g sample of water at 60.0째C is heated to water vapor at 140.0째C.
How much heat was absorbed?
A 175 g lump of molten lead at its melting point (327째C) is placed into 55.0 g of water at 20.0째C.
The specific heat of lead is  130 \ J/kg \cdot ^\circ C and the  H_f  of lead is 20,400 J/kg.
When the lead has become solid but is still at the melting point, what is the temperature of the water?
When the lead and the water have reached equilibrium, what is the temperature of the mixture?
phase change:
When a substance changes from one state, or phase, of matter to another we say that it has undergone a change of state, or we say that it has undergone a change of phase.
heat of fusion:
The change in potential energy for the conversion of 1 mole or 1 gram of a solid to a liquid, at constant pressure and temperature and is usually denoted as  \Delta H_f .
