Figure below shows how a mutation in a hox gene can affect an insectâ€™s development.
Other organisms, including humans, also have how genes.

Effect of Hox gene mutation in fruit fly
Effect of Hox Gene Mutation.
Scientists caused a mutation in a hox gene of this fruit fly.
As a result of the mutation, a leg grew out of its head where an antenna should have developed.
Gene Expression and Cancer
The mutations that cause cancer generally occur in two types of regulatory genes: tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes (see Figure below ).
These genes produce regulatory proteins that control the cell cycle.
When the genes mutate, cells with mutations divide rapidly and without limits, potentially resulting in a tumor and cancer.
Flowchart of how cancer develops
How Cancer Develops.
This flow chart shows how a series of mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes leads to cancer.
Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is generally more complex than in prokaryotes.
It involves unique regulatory elements in different cells as well as common regulatory elements such as the TATA box.
Regulation is especially important during development.
It may involve regulatory genes such as homeobox genes that switch other regulatory genes on or off.
Mutations in regulatory genes that normally control the cell cycle cause cancer.
