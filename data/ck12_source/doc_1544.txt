This causes the atmosphere to move and create weather.
Sunlight also powers photosynthesis and life on Earth.
The Sun's Energy
Most of the energy at Earth's surface comes from the Sun.
Solar energy travels in tiny packets that move in waves.
The waves have different wavelengths.
Waves with different wavelengths carry different amounts of energy.
Photons of Energy
The Sun gives off energy in tiny packets called photons .
