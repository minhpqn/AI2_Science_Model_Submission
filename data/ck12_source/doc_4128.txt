Most of the dinosaurs disappeared from Earth about 65 million years ago.
This is probably the most famous example of a mass extinction.
So how do you define a mass extinction?
An organism goes extinct when all of the members of a species die out and no more members remain.
Extinctions are part of natural selection.
Species often go extinct when their environment changes, and they do not have the traits they need to survive.
Only those individuals with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive ( Figure below ).
Humans caused the extinction of the kiwi bird
Humans have caused many extinctions by introducing species to new places.
For example, many of New Zealand’s birds have adapted to nesting on the ground.
This was possible because there were no land mammals in New Zealand.
Then Europeans arrived and brought cats, foxes, and other predators with them.
Several of New Zealand’s ground nesting birds, such as this flightless kiwi, are now extinct or threatened because of these predators.
Mass extinctions , such as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine mammals, happened after major catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes ( Figure below ).
The fossil of a dinosaur
The fossil of Tarbosaurus, one of the land dinosaurs that went extinct during one of the mass extinctions.
Since life began on Earth, there have been several major mass extinctions.
If you look closely at the geological time scale, you will find that at least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past 540 million years.
In each mass extinction, over 50% of animal species died.
The total number of mass extinctions could be as high as 20.
