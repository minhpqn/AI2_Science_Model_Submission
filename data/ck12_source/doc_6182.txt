How does the number of particles influence vapor pressure?
Silver chloride is a non-volatile material, but does not dissolve in water.
What effect will it have on the vapor pressure of water?
colligative property:
A property of a solution that depends only on the number of solute particles dissolved in the solution and not on their identity.
non-volatile:
Does not evaporate easily.
Freezing Point Depression
Define freezing point depression.
Calculate the freezing point of a solution when given the molal freezing-point depression constant.
Salting roads lowers the freezing point, which will cause ice to melt more quickly
Why salt icy roads?
Colligative properties have practical applications, such as the salting of roads in cold-weather climates.
By applying salt to an icy road, the melting point of the ice is decreased, and the ice will melt more quickly, making driving safer.
Sodium chloride (NaCl) and either calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) or magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 ) are used most frequently, either alone or in a mixture.
Sodium chloride is the least expensive option, but is less effective because it only dissociates into two ions instead of three.
Freezing Point Depression
The Figure below shows the phase diagram for a pure solvent and how it changes when a solute is added to it.
The solute lowers the vapor pressure of the solvent resulting in a lowering of the freezing point of the solution compared to the solvent.
The freezing point depression is the difference in temperature between the freezing point of the pure solvent and that of the solution.
