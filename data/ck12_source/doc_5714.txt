When l=3 ,  m_l values can be -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3 for a total of seven different orbital shapes.
Again, note the specific orientations of the different f orbitals.

There are four different classes of electron orbitals.
These orbitals are determined by the value of the angular momentum quantum number l .
