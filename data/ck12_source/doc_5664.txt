Explain what mass number represents.
Athletes wearing the same-colored jerseys are all on the same team.
In addition, each player’s jersey has a unique number to distinguish him from his teammates.
Imagine how confusing it would be if members of both teams wore the same-colored jerseys or all the members of a team had the same number on their jerseys.
How could you tell the athletes apart?
Telling Atoms Apart
It’s often useful to have ways to signify different people or objects like athletes on teams.
The same is true of atoms.
It’s important to be able to distinguish atoms of one element from atoms of other elements.
Elements are pure substances that make up all other matter, so each one is given a unique name.
The names of elements are also represented by unique one- or two-letter symbols, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon, and He for helium.
You can see other examples in the Figure below .
