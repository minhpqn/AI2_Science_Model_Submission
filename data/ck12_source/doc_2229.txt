Makemake is only 75 percent the size of Pluto.
Its diameter is between 1300 and 1900 kilometers.
The name comes from the mythology of the Eastern Islanders.
Makemake was the god that created humanity.
At a distance between 38.5 to 53 AU, this dwarf planet orbits the Sun in 310 years.
Makemake is made of methane, ethane, and nitrogen ices.

Drawing of the largest known dwarf planet Eris
Eris is the largest known dwarf planet, but it's so far from the Sun that it wasn't discovered until 2005.
Eris is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system.
It is 27 percent larger than Pluto ( Figure above ).
Like Pluto and Makemake, Eris is in the Kuiper belt.
But Eris is about three times farther from the Sun than Pluto.
Because of its distance, Eris was not discovered until 2005.
Early on, it was thought that Eris might be the tenth planet.
Its discovery helped astronomers realize that they needed a new definition of “planet.” Eris has a small moon that orbits Eris once about every 16 days.
Astronomers know there may be other dwarf planets far out in the solar system.
Look for Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus to possibly be added to the list of dwarf planets in the future.
We still have a lot to discover and explore!
