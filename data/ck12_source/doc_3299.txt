When an atom loses electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion, or cation.
When an atom gains electrons, it becomes a negative charged ion, or anion.
Ions are created by the loss or gain of electrons
Conservation of Charge
Like the formation of ions, the formation of charged matter in general depends on the transfer of electrons, either between two materials or within a material.
Three ways this can occur are referred to as conduction, polarization, and friction.
All three ways are described below.
However, regardless of how electrons are transferred, the total charge always remains the same.
Electrons move, but they aren’t destroyed.
This is the law of conservation of charge .
The transfer of electrons from the van de Graaff generator to the man is an example of conduction.
Conduction occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.
A van de Graff generator produces a negative charge on its dome, so it tends to give up electrons.
Human hands are positively charged, so they tend to accept electrons.
Therefore, electrons flow from the dome to the man’s hand when they are in contact.
You don’t need a van de Graaff generator for conduction to take place.
It may occur when you walk across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes.
Wool tends to give up electrons and rubber tends to accept them.
Therefore, the carpet transfers electrons to your shoes each time you put down your foot.
The transfer of electrons results in you becoming negatively charged and the carpet becoming positively charged.
