sexual reproduction :
Reproduction involving the joining of haploid gametes, producing genetically diverse individuals.
synapsis :
The pairing of two homologous chromosomes that occurs during prophase I of meiosis.
tetrad :
A configuration with four chromatids; formed by the pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis.
Crossing-over, the independent assortment of chromosomes during anaphase I, and random fertilization all increase the genetic variation of a species.
Define crossing-over in meiosis.
Describe how crossing-over, independent assortment, and random fertilization lead to genetic variation.
Describe how independent assortment relates to the laws of inheritance.
When does mitosis and meiosis occur?
Gametogenesis - Advanced
Describe gametogenesis and identify the key differences between oogenesis and spermatogenesis.
What's the biggest cell on Earth?
The ostrich egg - unfertilized, of course.
Yes, this egg, just like a human ovum, is just one cell.
It is a gamete with a haploid number of chromosomes, formed through meiosis.
The egg shell membrane encloses the nucleus containing the genetic material and the cytoplasm.
At the end of meiosis, haploid cells are produced.
These cells need to further develop into mature gametes capable of fertilization, a process called gametogenesis ( Figure below ).
