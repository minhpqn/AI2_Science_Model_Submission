Pollination is the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants.
Pollen consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants.
They are produced by a male flower part called the anther (see Figure below ).
Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same or another flower.
The stigma is a female part of a flower.
It passes the pollen grains to female gametes in the ovary.
Parts of a flower
Flowers are the reproductive organs of plants.
Each pea plant flower has both male and female parts.
The anther is part of the stamen, the male structure that produces male gametes (pollen).
The stigma is part of the pistil, the female structure that produces female gametes and guides the pollen grains to them.
The stigma receives the pollen grains and passes them to the ovary, which contains female gametes.
Pea plants are naturally self-pollinating.
In self-pollination , pollen grains from anthers on one plant are transferred to stigmas of flowers on the same plant.
Mendel was interested in the offspring of two different parent plants, so he had to prevent self-pollination.
He removed the anthers from the flowers of some of the plants in his experiments.
Then he pollinated them by hand with pollen from other parent plants of his choice.
When pollen from one plant fertilizes another plant of the same species, it is called cross-pollination .
The offspring that result from such a cross are called hybrids.
Gregor Mendel experimented with pea plants to learn how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring.
