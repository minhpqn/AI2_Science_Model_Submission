Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons.
Gluons carry the strong nuclear force that binds together the quarks in a neutron.

A model airplane
What is this model airplane composed of?
Millions of children over the years have enjoyed building models - this model airplane is one example of the types of models that can be constructed.
Perhaps sixty years ago the models were made of balsa wood, a very light material.  Parts would be cut by hand, carefully glued together, and then covered with paper or other fabric.  The development of plastics made the construction of model aircraft much simpler in many respects.
