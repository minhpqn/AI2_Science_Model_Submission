This shows that the reaction can go both ways.
How would you represent the reversible reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen gases combine to produce water?
A:
The chemical equation would be:
H 2 + O 2 \rightleftharpoons H 2 O
In a reversible reaction, both forward and reverse directions of the reaction generally occur at the same time.
While reactants are reacting to produce products, products are reacting to produce reactants.
Often, a point is reached at which forward and reverse directions of the reaction occur at the same rate.
When this happens, there is no overall change in the amount of reactants and products, even though the reactions keep occurring in both directions.
This point is called equilibrium .
The term equilibrium means “state of balance,” and it is used to refer to a state of balance between any opposing changes.
You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at this URL:
Irreversible chemical reactions can occur in only one direction.
The reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants.
Reversible chemical reactions can occur in both directions.
The reactants can change to the products, and the products can also change back to the reactants.
Equilibrium occurs when forward and reverse directions of a reversible reaction occur at the same rate so there is no overall change in the amounts of reactants and products.
