As a result, the water at the bottom of a lake or the ocean usually has temperature of about 4°C.
In climates with cold winters, this layer of 4°C water insulates the bottom of a lake from freezing temperatures.
Lake organisms such as fish can survive the winter by staying in this cold, but unfrozen, water at the bottom of the lake.
adhesion :
The force of attraction between unlike molecules, or the attraction between the surfaces of contacting bodies.
boiling point :
The temperature at which a liquid changes state into a gas.
capillary action :
The ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow space.
cohesion :
The tendency for water molecules to stick together.
homeostasis :
The process of maintaining a stable environment inside a cell or an entire organism.
hydrogen bond :
A weak bond between two molecules resulting from an electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an electronegative atom in the other; always involves a hydrogen atom.
melting point :
The temperature at which a solid changes state into a liquid.
polarity :
A difference in electrical charge between different parts of a molecule.
polar molecule :
