Describe the concept of flux and calculate the induced voltage.
Apply Lenz law to determine the direction of the induced current in a loop of wire.
Students will learn how to determine the flux and how to calculate the induced voltage.
In addition, Students will learn Lenz law and how to use it to determine the direction of the induced current in a loop of wire.
\Phi = N \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} &&\text{ Electromagnetic Flux}
emf = -\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}&& \text{Faraday's Law of Induction}
To understand induction, we need to introduce the concept of electromagnetic flux .
If you have a closed, looped wire of area A (measured in  \mathrm{m^2}  ) and N loops, and you pass a magnetic field B through, the magnetic flux \Phi is given by the formula below.
Again, the relative direction of the loops and the field matter; this relationship is preserved by creating an 'area vector': a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop.
The directions' influence can then be conveniently captured through a dot product: \Phi = N \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} &&\text{ Electromagnetic Flux}
The units of magnetic flux are \text{T} \times \mathrm{m^2} , also known as Webers \text{(Wb)} .
In the example above, there are four loops of wire (N = 4) and each has area \pi r^2 (horizontally hashed).
