Do water-walking insects produce a wax that keeps their legs from getting wet?
What is on these insects legs that helps them walk on water?
How do other insects keep from sinking in the water?
Define surface tension.
What is responsible for the strong surface tension in water?
Does diethyl ether have a stronger or weaker surface tension than water?
surface tension:
A measure of the elastic force in the liquid’s surface.
Describe the effect of temperature on the rate of evaporation.
A swamp cooler relies on evaporation to cool a building
What is that box on the house's roof?
On the roof of the house in the picture above is a device known as a “swamp cooler.” This piece of equipment traces its origin back to the ancient Egyptians who hung wet blankets across the doors of their homes.
As the warm air passed through the blankets, water would evaporate and cool the air.
The royalty went one step further and had servants fan wet cloths over jugs of water to get more evaporation and cooling.
The origin of the term “swamp cooler” is not known – they certainly don’t work in a swamp.
Best conditions for cooling include a high temperature (over 80°F) and a low humidity (preferably less than 30%).
These coolers work well in desert areas, but don’t provide any cooling in the humid areas of the country.
A puddle of water left undisturbed eventually disappears.
The liquid molecules escape into the gas phase, becoming water vapor.
Vaporization is the process in which a liquid is converted to a gas.
