Below, you can see how this works ( Figure below ).
Carbon taxes are taxes placed on products that produce carbon dioxide.
An example of this is gasoline for your car.
The taxes encourage people to use less fossil fuel.
This naturally reduces carbon dioxide emissions.
Carbon sequestration captures carbon dioxide as it is emitted by a power plant before it enters the atmosphere.
The carbon dioxide is then stored in another form.
Carbon is sequestered naturally by forests.
Trees take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.
Artificial methods of sequestering carbon underground are being researched.
This is just one of the geoengineering methods that are being researched for reducing carbon dioxide.
Diagram of how cap-and-trade works
This diagram shows how a cap-and-trade system works.
New technologies can be developed.
Renewable energy sources emit fewer or no greenhouse gases.
These sources are discussed in the chapter Natural Resources .
What You Can Do
Reducing the amount that temperatures will rise will take all nations working together.
But individuals can make a difference.
