This was the forerunner of the compound microscope and of the telescope.
In 1665, Robert Hooke, an English natural scientist, used a microscope to zoom in on a piece of cork - the stuff that makes up the stoppers in wine bottles, which is made from tree bark.
Inside of cork, he discovered tiny structures,  which he called cells.
It turns out that cells are the smallest structural unit of living organisms.
This finding eventually led to the development of the theory that all living things are made of cells.
Without microscopes, this discovery would not have been possible, and the cell theor y would not have been developed.
Hooke's discovery of the cell set the stage for other scientists to discover other types of organisms.
After Hooke, the "father of microscopy," Dutch scientist Antoine van Leeuwenhoek ( Figure below ) taught himself to make one of the first microscopes.
In one of his early experiments, van Leeuwenhoek took a sample of scum from his own teeth and used his microscope to discover bacteria , the smallest living organism on the planet.
Using microscopes, van Leeuwenhoek also discovered one-celled protists and sperm cells.
Today, microscopes are used by all types of scientists, including cell biologists, microbiologists, virologists, forensic scientists, entomologists, taxonomists, and many other types.

Types of Microscopes
Some modern microscopes use light, as Hooke's and van Leeuwenhoek's did.
Others may use electron beams or sound waves.
Researchers now use these four types of microscopes:
Light microscopes allow biologists to see small details of a specimen.
Most of the microscopes used in schools and laboratories are light microscopes.
Light microscopes use lenses, typically made of glass or plastic, to focus light either into the eye, a camera, or some other light detector.
