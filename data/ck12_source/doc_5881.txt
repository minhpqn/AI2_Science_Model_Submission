The ionic bond is the attraction of the Na + ion for the Cl âˆ’ ion.  It is conventional to show the cation without dots around the symbol to emphasize that the original energy level that contained the valence electron is now empty.  The anion is now shown with a complete octet of electrons.
For a compound such as magnesium chloride, it is not quite as simple.
Because magnesium has two valence electrons, it needs to lose both to achieve the noble-gas configuration.  Therefore, two chlorine atoms will be needed.
Transfer of electrons from magnesium to chlorines to form magnesium chloride
The final formula for magnesium chloride is MgCl 2 .
An ionic compound contains positive and negative ions.
An ionic bond is electrostatic in nature.
