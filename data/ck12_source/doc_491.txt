Sound waves in air cause vibrations inside the ears.
The ears sense the vibrations.
Sound waves travel through the air in all directions from a sound
Sound waves travel through the air in all directions away from a sound, like waves traveling through water away from where a pebble was dropped.
The human ear is pictured below ( Figure below ).
As you read about it, trace the path of sound waves through the ear.
Assume a car horn blows in the distance.
Sound waves spread through the air from the horn.
Some of the sound waves reach your ear.
The steps below show what happens next.
They explain how your ears sense the sound.
This diagram illustrates the parts of the human ear
Read the names of the parts of the ear in the text; then find each of the parts in the diagram.
Note that the round window is distinct from the oval window.
The sound waves travel to the ear canal ( external auditory canal in the figure).
This is a tube-shaped opening in the ear.
At the end of the ear canal, the sound waves hit the eardrum ( tympanic membrane ).
This is a thin membrane that vibrates like the head of a drum when sound waves hit it.
The vibrations pass from the eardrum to the hammer ( malleus ).
This is the first of three tiny bones that pass vibrations through the ear.
