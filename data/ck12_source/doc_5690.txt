Step 3:
Think about your result.
While the resulting energy may seem very small, this is for only one photon of light.
Visible quantities of light consist of huge quantities of photons.
Recall that a hertz is equal to a reciprocal second, so the units agree in the equation.
A quantum relates to the energy gained or absorbed by an object.
The value of Planck’s constant is h=6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ \text{J} \cdot \text{s} .

What is a quantum?
Planck’s constant: h=6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ J \cdot s .
quantum:
The minimum quantity of energy that can either be lost or gained by an atom.
