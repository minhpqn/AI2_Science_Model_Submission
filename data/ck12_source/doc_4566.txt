Outline the roles of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach in digestion.
What's the first step in the digestion process?
It all starts with the mouth.
Food goes in, you chew it up, swallow it, then what happens?
The process of turning that food into energy and proteins and other things necessary for life begins.
But it all starts with the mouth.
The Start of Digestion:
Mouth to Stomach
Does the sight or aroma of your favorite food make your mouth water?
When this happens, you are getting ready for digestion.
The mouth is the first digestive organ that food enters.
The sight, smell, or taste of food stimulates the release of digestive enzymes by salivary glands inside the mouth.
The major salivary enzyme is amylase .
It begins the chemical digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down starch into sugar.
The mouth also begins the process of mechanical digestion .
Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it (see Figure below ).
Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew.
Food is easier to chew because it is moistened by saliva from the salivary glands.
