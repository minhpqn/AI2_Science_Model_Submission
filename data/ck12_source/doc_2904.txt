Mendel observed that the offspring of this cross (called the F1 generation ) were all tall plants!
Next, Mendel let the F1 generation self-pollinate.
That means the tall plant offspring were crossed with each other.
He found that 75% of their offspring (the F2 generation ) were tall, while 25% were short.
Shortness skipped a generation.
But why?
In all, Mendel studied seven characteristics, with almost 20,000 F2 plants analyzed.
All of his results were similar to the first experimentâ€”about three out of every four plants had one trait, while just one out of every four plants had the other.
For example, he crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants.
Do you think the colors blended?
No, they did not.
Just like the previous experiment, all offspring in this cross (the F1 generation) were one color: purple.
In the F2 generation, 75% of plants had purple flowers and 25% had white flowers ( Figure below ).
There was no blending of traits in any of Mendel's experiments.
Result of Mendel's experiment with purple and white flowered plants
The results of Mendel's experiment with purple flowered and white flowered-plants numerically matched the results of his experiments with other pea plant traits.
Gregor Mendel was the father of the field of genetics, which seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next.
To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits.
