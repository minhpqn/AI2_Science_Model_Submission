Positive hydrogen ions from HCl and negative hydroxide ions from NaOH combine to form water.
This part of the reaction can be represented by the equation:
H + + OH - → H 2 O
Positive sodium ions from NaOH and negative chloride ions from HCL combine to form the salt sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly called table salt.
This part of the reaction can be represented by the equation:
Na + + Cl - → NaCl
Another example of a neutralization reaction can be seen in the Figure below .
Antacid pills neutralize acid to prevent acid indigestion
These antacid tablets contain the base calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ).
The base reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach.
The reaction neutralizes the acid to relieve acid indigestion.
Q:
What products are produced when antacid tablets react with hydrochloric acid in the stomach?
A:
The products are water and the salt calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ).
Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is also produced.
The reaction is represented by the chemical equation:
CaCO 3 + 2HCl → H 2 O + CaCl 2 + CO 2
When acid and base solutions react, they produce water and a neutral ionic compound called a salt.
The reaction is called a neutralization reaction.
