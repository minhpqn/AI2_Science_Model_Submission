electric field:
A region of space characterized by the existence of a force that is generated by an electric charge.
electric field intensity:
Electric field intensity or field strength is described as the ratio of force to the amount of test charge.
The Electric Potential in a Uniform Field
Express the units for electric potential.
Distinguish between potential and potential difference.
Solve problems using potential in uniform electric fields.
Tesla coil producing electrical arcs
Often the star of science shows and museum installments, Tesla coils create magnificent displays of light and sound.
They have low electrical current but incredibly large electric potentials.
The Electric Potential in a Uniform Field
In the study of mechanics, the concept of energy, and the conservation thereof, was extremely useful.
The same will be true for the study of electrical interactions.
The work done moving a charged particle in an electric field can result in the particle gaining or losing both kinetic and potential energy.
Lifting an object in a gravitational field requires work and increases the object's potential energy.
A similar situation occurs when you move two charged objects relative to each other.
We already know that each object has an electric field surrounding it, which effects the other charge.
If the two charged objects have the same charge, they repel each other.
Moving these two objects closer to each other requires working against the repulsive force, which increases the potential energy of the system.
