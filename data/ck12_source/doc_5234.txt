Why do genes need to be unlinked for a dihybrid cross to predict proper outcomes of crosses?
Mendel carried out a dihybrid cross to examine the inheritance of the characteristics for seed color and seed shape.
The dominant allele for yellow seed color is Y, and the recessive allele for green color is y.
The dominant allele for round seeds is R, and the recessive allele for a wrinkled shape is r.
The two plants that were crossed were F1 dihybrids RrYy.
Identify the ratios of traits that Mendel observed in the F2 generation, and explain in terms of phenotype what each number means.
Create a Punnett square to help you answer the question.
If AaBb is crossed with aabb, what proportion of the offspring would be expected to be aabb?
Assume that you mated two individuals heterozygous for each of two traits and obtained 80 offspring.
How many of them would be expected to look like their parents?
Mendelian Inheritance in Humans - Advanced
Examine how a pedigree is used in the study of human inheritance.
Why is understanding your family's genetic history important?
If a genetic disorder runs throughout your family, understanding this history can help evaluate your and other's genetic risks associated with that phenotype.
This can be especially important as you decide to have your own children.
Mendelian Inheritance in Humans
Inheritance in humans is not as straight-forward as that in the pea plant.
Though some traits are inherited in simple Mendelian fashion, many are not.
To analyze simple Mendelian inheritance a pedigree is often utilized.
This is especially helpful in tracking the inheritance of a specific trait, characteristic or disorder (or allele) through a family.
