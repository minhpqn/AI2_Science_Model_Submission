Another role of the female system is to secrete estrogen.
Estrogen is the main sex hormone in females.
Estrogen has two major roles:
During the teen years, estrogen causes the reproductive organs to develop.
It also causes other female traits to develop.
For example, it causes the breasts to grow.
During adulthood, estrogen is needed for a woman to release eggs.
On average, a woman releases one egg each month from her ovaries.
The female reproductive system has another important function.
After puberty, the female reproductive system must prepare itself to accept a fertilized egg each cycle (about every month).
This cycle is controlled by a well-planned and very complex interplay of hormones.
If an egg is not fertilized, the system must prepare itself again the next cycle.
The female reproductive system also supports a baby as it develops before birth, and it facilitates the baby's birth at the end of pregnancy.
A human egg is a large round cell with a haploid nucleus
This represents a human egg, which is the gamete, or reproductive cell, in females.
Notice that is does not have a distinct shape, like a sperm cell has.
The egg is a round cell with a haploid nucleus in the center.
The egg contains most of the cytoplasm and organelles present in the first cell of a new organism.
The functions of the female reproductive system are to produce eggs, secrete estrogen, and support a baby as it develops before birth.
Estrogen, the main sex hormone in females, causes the female traits and reproductive organs to develop and is needed for the release of eggs.
