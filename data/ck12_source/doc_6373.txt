What is Trouton’s Rule?
What precautions need to be taken in selecting a value for \Delta H ?
Why is temperature selection important?
Why would the entropy of vaporization be so much larger than the entropy of fusion?
Calculations of Free Energy and Keq
Describe the relationship between  \Delta G^\circ and  K_{eq} .
Perform calculations involving these two parameters.
Limestone is formed by the dissolving and deposition of calcium carbonate
What are these formations called when they point down?
Formation of stalactites (pointing down) and stalagmites (pointing up) is a complex process.
Solutions of minerals drip down and absorb carbon dioxide as water flows through the cave.
Calcium carbonate dissolves in this liquid and redeposits on the rock as the carbon dioxide is dissipated into the environment.
Equilibrium Constant and \Delta G
At equilibrium the  \Delta G for a reversible reaction is equal to zero.
K_{eq} relates the concentrations of all substances in the reaction at equilibrium.
Therefore we can write (through a more advanced treatment of thermodynamics) the following equation:
\Delta G^\circ=-RT \ln K_{eq}
The variable  R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/K • mol), T is the Kelvin temperature, and  \ln K_{eq} is the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant.
When  K_{eq} is large, the products of the reaction are favored and the negative sign in the equation means that the  \Delta G^\circ is negative.
When  K_{eq} is small, the reactants of the reaction are favored.
