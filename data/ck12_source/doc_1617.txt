Why is the plasma membrane considered selectively permeable?
Why is this important?
Explain the composition of the cell membrane.
Explain the arrangement of phospholipids in the membrane.
Describe a concentration gradient.
Distinguish between diffusion and osmosis.
Differentiate between hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic solutions.
What happens if you put a few drops of food coloring in water?
Over time, the molecules of color spread out through the rest of the water.
When the molecules are evenly spread throughout the space, the water will become an even color.
This process of molecules moving from an area where there are lots of molecules to an area where there are fewer molecules is known as diffusion.
Small molecules can pass through the plasma membrane through a process called diffusion.
Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the substance to an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount) of the substance ( Figure below ).
The amount of a substance in relation to the total volume is the concentration .
During diffusion, molecules are said to flow down their concentration gradient , flowing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
Molecules flowing down a concentration gradient is a natural process and does not require energy.
Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, as long as a concentration gradient exists.
Molecules will continue to flow in this manner until equilibrium is reached.
At equilibrium, there is no longer an area of high concentration or low concentration, and molecules flow equally in both directions across the semipermeable membrane.
At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are entering and leaving a cell.
