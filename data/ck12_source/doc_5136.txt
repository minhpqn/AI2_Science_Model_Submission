When a cell is using the information within a gene, the segment of DNA containing that gene is unwound as chromatin , exposing the double helix to the cell machinery needed to use that information.
Prior to cell division, the DNA must duplicate itself in a process called DNA replication.
This ensures that each resulting cell receives a complete set of the organismâ€™s genome.
But how is the replicated DNA divided up evenly?
This will be discussed in an additional concept.
What guarantees that each new cell will receive a complete set of DNA?
It was the identification of chromosomes that allowed this process to be characterized.
As a eukaryotic cell prepares to divide, the DNA and associated proteins (histones) coil into a chromosome ( Figure below ).
The DNA copies itself prior to this process, so the chromosome that forms consists of two identical chromatids, known as sister chromatids , identical copies of DNA.
The two chromatids are attached at a region called the centromere.
The chromatids separate from each other when the nucleus divides just prior to cell division.
Thus, each new cell that results after cell division will have the complete compliment of genetic material, identical to the original, or parent, cell.
In human cells, this amounts to 46 chromosomes.
These chromosomes come in pairs (one from each pair inherited from each parent).
So these 46 chromosomes are actually two sets of 23 chromosomes each.
For an animation of how the DNA coils into a chromosome, see
(left) The DNA double helix wraps around proteins (2) and tightly coils a number of times to form a chromosome (5).
This figure shows the complexity of the coiling process.
The red dot shows the location of the centromere, where the microtubules attach during mitosis and meiosis. (right) A representation of a condensed eukaryotic chromosome, as seen after the DNA has been copied.
The chromosome is made of two identical, or sister, chromatids held together by a centromere.
