The immune response mainly involves the lymphatic system.
The lymphatic system is a major part of the immune system.
It produces leukocytes called lymphocytes.
Lymphocytes are the key cells involved in the immune response.
They recognize and help destroy particular pathogens in body fluids and cells.
They also destroy certain cancer cells.

Structures of the Lymphatic System
Figure below shows the structures of the lymphatic system.
They include organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes.
Organs of the lymphatic system are the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and tonsils.
Bone marrow is found inside many bones.
It produces lymphocytes.
The thymus is located in the upper chest behind the breast bone.
It stores and matures lymphocytes.
The spleen is in the upper abdomen.
It filters pathogens and worn out red blood cells from the blood, and then lymphocytes in the spleen destroy them.
The tonsils are located on either side of the pharynx in the throat.
They trap pathogens, which are destroyed by lymphocytes in the tonsils.
