Mammals have hair or fur.
It insulates the body to help conserve body heat.
It can also be used for sensing and communicating.
For example, cats use their whiskers to sense their surroundings.
They also raise their fur to look larger and more threatening (see Figure below ).

By raising its fur, this cat is “saying” that it’s big and dangerous.
This might discourage a predator from attacking.
Most mammals share several other traits.
The traits in the following list are typical of, but not necessarily unique to, mammals.
The skin of many mammals is covered with sweat glands.
The glands produce sweat, the salty fluid that helps cool the body.
Mammalian lungs have millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli .
They provide a very large surface area for gas exchange.
The heart of a mammal consists of four chambers.
This makes it more efficient and powerful for delivering oxygenated blood to tissues.
The brain of a mammal is relatively large and has a covering called the neocortex .
This structure plays an important role in many complex brain functions.
The mammalian middle ear has three tiny bones that carry sound vibrations from the outer to inner ear.
