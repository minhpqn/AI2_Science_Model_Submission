Describe in words the chemical reaction represented by the following chemical equation: 2NO 2 → 2O 2 + N 2
When is a chemical equation balanced?
Balancing Chemical Equations
Describe a balanced chemical equation.
Explain the meaning of coefficients in chemical equations.
Outline how to balance chemical equations.
The little girl on this seesaw weighs more than the little boy on the other side.
That’s why her side of the seesaw is on the ground and his side is up in the air.
For a seesaw to balance, the two riders must be the same weight.
A chemical equation that represents a chemical reaction is a little bit like a seesaw.
For a chemical equation to balance, there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation.
Writing Chemical Equations
A chemical equation represents the changes that occur during a chemical reaction.
A chemical equation has the general form:
Reactants → Products
An example of a simple chemical reaction is the reaction in which hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) combine to produce water (H 2 O).
In this reaction, the reactants are hydrogen and oxygen and the product is water.
To write the chemical equation for this reaction, you would start by writing the reactants on the left and the product on the right, with an arrow between them to show the direction in which the reaction occurs:
H 2 + O 2 → H 2 O
