Hydropower ( Figure below ), which uses the energy of moving water to turn turbines (similar to windmills) or water wheels, that create electricity.
This form of energy produces no waste or pollution.
It is a renewable resource.
A hydroelectric plant converts the energy in moving water into electricity
Geothermal power , which uses the natural flow of heat from the Earthâ€™s core to produce steam.
This steam is used to turn turbines which create electricity.
Biomass is the mass of biological organisms.
It is usually used to describe the amount of organic matter in a trophic level of an ecosystem.
Biomass production involves using organic matter ("biomass") from plants to create electricity.
Using corn to make ethanol fuel is an example of biomass generated energy.
Biomass is generally renewable.
Tides in the ocean can also turn a turbine to create electricity.
This energy can then be stored until needed ( Figure below ).
Tidal power is also a renewable resource that can be used to generate electricity

Turning Trash Into Treasure
Scientists at the Massachusetts of Technology are turning trash into coal, which can readily be used to heat homes and cook food in developing countries.
This coal burns cleaner than that from fossil fuels.
It also save a tremendous amount of energy.
