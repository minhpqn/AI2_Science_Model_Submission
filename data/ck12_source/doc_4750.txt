A flower has a complicated and beautiful structure.
So does a crystal.
But if you look closely at the crystal, you see no change.
The flower, on the other hand, is transporting water through its petals, producing pigment molecules, breaking down sugar for energy, and undergoing a large number of other biochemical reactions that are needed for living organisms to stay alive.
The sum of all the chemical reactions in a cell is metabolism .
A human body has a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, (about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit).
If you step outside on a cold morning, the temperature might be below freezing.
Nevertheless, you do not become an ice cube.
You shiver and the movement in your arms and legs allows you to stay warm.
Eating food also gives your body the energy it needs to keep warm.
Living organisms keep their internal environments within a certain range (they maintain a stable internal condition), despite changes in their external environment.
This process is called homeostasis , and is an important characteristic of all living organisms.
Built of Cells
If you look closely at any organism you can see that it is made of structures called cells .
Organisms that are very different such as ferns, fish, and elephants all look similar at the cellular level.
A cell is the basic unit of structure and function of all living organisms.
All living organisms are made of one or more cells: a simple bacterium will consist of just one cell, whereas you are made of trillions of cells.
Humans and onions look very different, but when comparing the cells, you might notice some similarities

If you looked at human and onion cells under a microscope, this is what you might see.
