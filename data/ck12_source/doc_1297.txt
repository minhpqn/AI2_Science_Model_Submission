All of the folds mentioned in the text below are found in the arid Southwestern U.S.
Deep within the crust, as plates collide, rocks crumple into folds .
You can model these folds by placing your hands on opposite edges of a piece of cloth and pushing your hands together.
Your hands moving toward each other creates compressive stress.
In sedimentary rocks, you can easily trace the folding of the layers ( Figure below ).
In the image below, the rock layers are no longer horizontal.
They tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline.
Once rocks are folded, they do not return to their original shape.
Diagram of the Grand Staircase in Utah
This is a geologic cross section of the Grand Staircase in Utah.
Where the rocks fold up, at the left of the diagram, is a small syncline.
There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines.
A monocline is a simple “one step“ bend in the rock layers ( Figure below ).
In a monocline, the oldest rocks are at the bottom, and the youngest are at the top.
Picture of a monocline
The rock layers in the center left are tilted in one direction, forming a monocline.
An anticline is a fold that arches upward.
The rocks dip away from the center of the fold ( Figure below ).
The oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline.
The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure.
