Why is it a good idea for Noreen to open her bag of chips before she drives to the top of a high mountain?
How much pressure are you exerting on the floor when you stand on one foot? (You will need to estimate the area of your foot in square meters.)
Calculate the amount of force exerted on a 2 \;\mathrm{cm} \times 2 \;\mathrm{cm} patch of your skin due to atmospheric pressure (P_0 = 101,000 \;\mathrm{Pa}) .
Why doesn’t your skin burst under this force?
Assuming that the pressure of the atmosphere decreases exponentially as you rise in elevation according to the formula P = P_0 e^\frac{-h} {a} , where P_0 is the atmospheric pressure at sea level (101,000 \;\mathrm{Pa}) , h is the altitude in km and a is the scale height of the atmosphere (a \approx 8.4 \;\mathrm{km}) .
Use this formula to determine the change in pressure as you go from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe, which is at an elevation approximately 2 \;\mathrm{km} above sea level.
If you rise to half the scale height of Earth’s atmosphere, by how much does the pressure decrease?
If the pressure is half as much as on sea level, what is your elevation?
An instructor has an ideal monatomic helium gas sample in a closed container with a volume of 0.01\;\mathrm{m}^3 , a temperature of 412 \;\mathrm{K} , and a pressure of 474 \;\mathrm{kPa} .
Approximately how many gas atoms are there in the container?
Calculate the mass of the individual gas atoms.
Calculate the speed of a typical gas atom in the container.
The container is heated to 647 \;\mathrm{K} .
What is the new gas pressure?
While keeping the sample at constant temperature, enough gas is allowed to escape to decrease the pressure by half.
How many gas atoms are there now?
Is this number half the number from part (a)?
Why or why not?
The closed container is now compressed isothermally so that the pressure rises to its original pressure.
What is the new volume of the container?
