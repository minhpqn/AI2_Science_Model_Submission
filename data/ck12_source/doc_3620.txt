Meiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase of the cell cycle.
In both meiosis I and meiosis II, cells go through the same four phases as mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.
However, there are important differences between meiosis I and mitosis.
The flowchart in Figure below shows what happens in both meiosis I and II.

This flowchart of meiosis shows meiosis I in greater detail than meiosis II.
Meiosis I—but not meiosis II—differs somewhat from mitosis.
Compare meiosis I in this flowchart with the earlier figure featuring mitosis.

Compare meiosis I in this flowchart with the figure from the Mitosis and Cytokinesis concept.
How does meiosis I differ from mitosis?
Notice at the beginning of meiosis (prophase I), homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA.
This is known as crossing-over , and is unique to this phase of meiosis.

Prophase I:
The nuclear envelope begins to break down, and the chromosomes condense.
Centrioles start moving to opposite poles of the cell, and a spindle begins to form.
Importantly, homologous chromosomes pair up, which is unique to prophase I.
