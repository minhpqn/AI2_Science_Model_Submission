How does mechanical weathering increase the effectiveness of chemical weathering processes?
How do plants contribute to chemical weathering?
Influences on Weathering
Learn how different factors influence weathering.
How is weathering different in these two places?
Weathering varies for a lot of reasons.
If you compare these two photos, one reason stands out.
On the left, there is a lot of plant life.
On the right, not so much.
Why is the amount of plant life so different?
The left is a rainforest, with a warm and wet climate.
The right is a desert, with a warm and dry climate.
Climate is very important for causing weathering.
The way a landscape is modified depends on the climate of the region and other factors.
Rock and Mineral Type
Some types of minerals weather easily.
Some types of minerals are very resistant to weathering.
Some minerals in a rock might completely dissolve in water.
This leaves behind the more resistant minerals, which are released from the rock.
A beautiful example of this effect is the "Stone Forest" in China, shown in the video below:
