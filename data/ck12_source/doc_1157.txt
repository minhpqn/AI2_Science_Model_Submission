The crust is less than 1% of Earth by mass.
The two types are oceanic crust and continental crust.
The mantle is hot, dense, dark (ultramafic) rock.
It represents about 68% of Earth's mass.
The core is mostly iron metal.
The core makes up about 31% of the Earth.
Earth's metallic core has two layers: a solid inner layer and a liquid outer layer.
The terms core, mantle, and crust will be described in more detail in the next three concepts.
Layers by Mechanical Properties
Lithosphere and asthenosphere are divisions based on mechanical properties:
The lithosphere is composed of both the crust and the uppermost mantle.
The lithosphere is a brittle, rigid solid.
It is easily cracked or broken.
The asthenosphere is below the lithosphere.
The asthenosphere is also in the upper mantle.
This layer is solid, but it can flow and bend.
A solid that can flow is like silly putty.
This animation shows the layers by composition and by mechanical properties:
By composition, Earth is divided into core, mantle, and crust.
By mechanical properties, the crust and upper mantle are divided into lithosphere and asthenosphere.
