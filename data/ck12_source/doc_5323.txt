transformation :
The change in genotype and phenotype of a cell/organism due to the assimilation of external DNA (heredity material) by a cell.
virus :
A sub-microscopic particle that can infect living cells; contains DNA (or RNA) and can evolve, but lacks other characteristics of living organisms.
The work of several researchers led to the discovery that DNA is the genetic material.
Along the way, Griffith discovered the process of transformation.
Avery discovered that DNA was the hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase confirmed that DNA is the genetic material.
