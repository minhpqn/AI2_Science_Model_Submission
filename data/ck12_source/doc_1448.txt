In some parts of the world, gathering water for the family is a process that takes several hours.
This is usually considered to be women's work.
What are you doing during the hours that girls your age might be helping their mothers gather water?
An underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater is called an aquifer .
A diagram of an aquifer is pictured below ( Figure below ).
Aquifers are generally found in porous rock, such as sandstone.
Water infiltrates the aquifer from the surface.
The water that enters the aquifer is called recharge .
Diagram of an aquifer
An aquifer is a layer of saturated porous rock.
It lies below the water table.
An impermeable layer, such as clay, is below the aquifer.
Human Use of Aquifers
Most land areas have aquifers beneath them.
Many aquifers are used by people for fresh water.
The closer to the surface an aquifer is, the easier it is to get the water.
However, an aquifer close to the surface is also more likely to become polluted.
Pollutants can seep down through porous rock in recharge water.
An aquifer that is used by people may not be recharged as quickly as its water is removed.
The water table may lower and the aquifer may even run dry.
