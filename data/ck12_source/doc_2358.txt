If you did, then you probably made a poster outlining what you did for your project and how your project turned out.
Scientists often share their research in the same way.
The picture above shows a poster session at a scientific conference.
Posters are a quick and graphic way to communicate about research.
Importance of Communication in Science
The last step of most scientific investigations is reporting the results.
When scientists communicate their findings, they add to the body of scientific knowledge, and thatâ€™s how science advances.
Science generally builds on previous knowledge, sometimes advancing in giant steps but more often in baby steps.
The brick building analogy in the Figure below may help you better understand why communication is important in science.
Brick building, representing scientific cooperation
You can think of scientific knowledge as a brick building, and the work of a single scientist as an individual brick.
Considered by itself, the work of a single scientist may not seem that important, yet it may be an important piece of the overall structure.
But unless a scientist communicates research results, that single brick may never be added to the building.
When scientists communicate about their research, they may also get useful feedback from other scientists.
For example, comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their findings in a different way.
Other scientists can also repeat the research to see if they get the same results.
Q:
Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an investigation?
A:
If an investigation is repeated and different results are obtained, then it throws doubt on the original research.
