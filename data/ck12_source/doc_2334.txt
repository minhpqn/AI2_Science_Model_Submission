Technology and Science
Explain how technology and science are related.
Give examples of ways that technology and science help each other advance.
This incredible image was made by the Hubble space telescope.
The image is called Pillars of Creation .
It shows the actual formation of stars in distant space.
The Hubble telescope is a very powerful telescope that orbits Earth like a satellite.
Scientists placed the Hubble telescope into space so it could make clear images like this without background lights on Earth competing with the dim light from distant stars.
It has led to many scientific discoveries.
How Technology and Science Are Related
The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related.
Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries.
However, technology and science have different goals.
The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge.
The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical problems.
Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance.
Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope.
New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways.
How Technology Revolutionized Science
The Hubble telescope was put into orbit around Earth in the 1990s, but scientists have been using telescopes to make discoveries for hundreds of years.
