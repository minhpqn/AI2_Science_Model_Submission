Conserve fossil fuels.
For example, turning out lights when we arenâ€™t using them saves electricity.
Why does this help?
A lot of the electricity we use comes from coal-burning power plants.
Use fossil fuels more efficiently.
For example, driving a fuel-efficient car lets you go farther on each gallon of gas.
This can add up to a big savings in fossil fuel use.
Keep up with technology.
Hybrid cars run on electricity that would be wasted during braking.
These cars use gas only as a backup fuel.
As a result, they produce just 10 percent of the air pollution produced by regular cars.
Keeping Pollutants out of the Air
Some of the pollutants from fossil fuels can be filtered out of exhaust before it is released into the air ( Figure below ).
Other pollutants can be changed to harmless compounds before they are released.
Two widely used technologies are scrubbers and catalytic converters.
Scrubbers are used in factories and power plants.
They remove particulates and waste gases from exhaust before it is released to the air.
Catalytic converters are used on motor vehicles.
They break down pollutants in exhaust to non-toxic compounds.
For example, they change nitrogen oxides to harmless nitrogen and oxygen gases.
