The objects are guitar strings, and the moving string is the one on the bottom right.
The string is moving because it has just been plucked.
Plucking the string gave it energy, which is moving through the string in a mechanical wave.
A mechanical wave is a wave that travels through matter.
The matter a mechanical wave travels through is called the medium.
The type of mechanical wave passing through the vibrating guitar string is a transverse wave.
What Is a Transverse Wave?
A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium vibrate at right angles, or perpendicular, to the direction that the wave travels.
Another example of a transverse wave is the wave that passes through a rope with you shake one end of the rope up and down, as in the Figure below .
The direction of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the hand.
The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it.
