Most of a mushroom's surface area is actually underground.
If you see a mushroom in your yard, that is just a small part of a larger fungus growing underground.
These are the steps involved in fungi "eating":
Fungi squirt special enzymes into their environment.
The enzymes help digest large organic molecules, similar to cutting up your food before you eat.
Cells of the fungi then absorb the broken-down nutrients.
Fungi are heterotrophs, meaning they obtain food from outside themselves.
Common fungi include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms.
