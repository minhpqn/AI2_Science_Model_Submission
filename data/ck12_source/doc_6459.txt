Whatâ€™s that blue stuff?
The reaction of copper wire with nitric acid produces a colorful mix of products that include copper(II) nitrate, nitrogen dioxide, and water.
Copper salts are blue in solution, reflecting the rather unique arrangements of electrons in the  d orbital as the copper ionizes from metallic copper.
Identifying Reaction Types
A redox reaction must involve a change in oxidation number for two of the elements involved in the reaction.
The oxidized element increases in oxidation number, while the reduced element decreases in oxidation number.
Single-replacement reactions are redox reactions because two different elements appear as free element (oxidation number of zero) on one side of the equation and as part of a compound on the other side.
Therefore, its oxidation number must change.
\text{Zn}+2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{ZnCl}_2 + \text{H}_2
Zn is oxidized from Zn 0 to Zn 2+ and the H is reduced from H + to H 0
Combustion reactions are redox reactions because elemental oxygen (O 2 ) acts as the oxidizing agent and is itself reduced.
\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
Most combination and decomposition reactions are redox reactions since elements are usually transformed into compounds and vice-versa.
The thermite reaction involves ferric oxide and metallic aluminum:
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3+2\text{Al} \rightarrow \text{Al}_2\text{O}_3+2\text{Fe}
The thermite reaction involves the oxidation of aluminum and the reduction of iron
Thermite grenade demonstration.
We see that the iron is reduced and the aluminum oxidized during the course of the reaction.
