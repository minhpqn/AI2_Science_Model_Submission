Human subjects also must be fully informed about their role in the research, including any potential risks.
You can read about a terrible violation of this ethical rule in the Figure below .
Tuskegee syphilis experiment
From the 1930s to 1970s, medical researchers (including the one pictured here) studied the progression of a serious disease in hundreds of poor men in Alabama.
They told the men they were simply receiving free medical care.
They never told the men that they had the disease, nor were the men treated for the disease when a cure was discovered in the 1940s.
Instead, the study continued for another 25 years.
It came to an end only when a whistleblower made it a front-page story around the nation.
Science and Everyday Ethical Decisions
Sometimes, science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives.
For example, scientific evidence shows that certain human actions—such as driving cars that burn gasoline—are contributing to changes in Earth’s climate.
This, in turn, is causing more severe weather and the extinction of many species.
A number of ethical decisions might be influenced by this scientific knowledge.
Q:
For example, should people avoid driving cars to work or school because it contributes to climate change and the serious problems associated with it?
What if driving is the only way to get there?
Can you think of an ethical solution?
A:
This example shows that ethical decisions may not be all or nothing.
For example, rather than driving alone, people might carpool with others.
