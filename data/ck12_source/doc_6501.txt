Carbon-14 is radioactive, but this isotope is only a small fraction of the total amount of carbon in existence (about one part per trillion carbon atoms).
Hydrogen also has a radioactive isotope known as hydrogen-3 or tritium, again a very small fraction of the total elemental hydrogen present.
The early history of the discovery of radioactivity is described.
