Your skin is part of your integumentary system ( Figure below ), which is the outer covering of your body.
The integumentary system is made up of your skin, hair, and nails.
Functions of Skin
Skin acts as a barrier that stops water and other things, like soap and dirt, from getting into your body
Skin acts as a barrier that stops water and other things, like soap and dirt, from getting into your body.
The skin has many important functions.
The skin:
Provides a barrier.
It keeps organisms that could harm the body out.
It stops water from entering or leaving the body.
Controls body temperature.
It does this by making sweat (or perspiration ), a watery substance that cools the body when it evaporates.
Gathers information about your environment.
Special nerve endings in your skin sense heat, pressure, cold, and pain.
Helps the body get rid of some types of waste, which are removed in sweat.
Acts as a sun block.
A pigment called melanin blocks sunlight from getting to deeper layers of skin cells, which are easily damaged by sunlight.
Structure of Skin
Your skin is always exposed to your external environment, so it gets cut, scratched, and worn down.
You also naturally shed many skin cells every day.
