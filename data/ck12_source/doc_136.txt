Most marsupials live in Australia and nearby areas. ( Figure below ).
The majority of mammals are placental mammals.
These are mammals in which the developing baby is fed through the mother's placenta.
Female placental mammals develop a placenta after fertilization.
A placenta is a spongy structure that passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus.
It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother.
The placenta allows the fetus to grow for a long time within the mother.
A kangaroo is a marsupial animal
A marsupial mammal, this eastern gray kangaroo has a joey (young kangaroo) in its abdominal pouch.
Some mammals are alone until a female can become pregnant.
Others form social groups with big differences between sexes, such as size differences, a trait called sexual dimorphism .
Dominant males are those that are the largest or best-armed.
These males usually have an advantage in mating.
They may also keep other males from mating with females within a group.
This is seen in elephant seals ( Figure below ), and also with elk, lions and non-human primates, including the orangutans and gorillas.
Male elk grow antlers, while female elk do not have antlers.
Adult male lions are not only larger than females, they have a mane of long hair on the side of the face and top of the head.
Seals have a mating system with many females and one male
A mating system with a group of many females and one male, as seen in the seal species.
Male elephant seals can grow to 14 feet long, whereas females can grow to 11 feet long.
