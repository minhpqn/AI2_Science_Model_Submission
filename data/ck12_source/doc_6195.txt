Net Ionic Equations
We can write a molecular equation for the formation of silver chloride precipitate:
\text{NaCl}+\text{AgNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{NaNO}_3+\text{AgCl}
The corresponding ionic equation is:
\text{Na}^+(aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq)+\text{Ag}^+(aq)+\text{NO}^-_3(aq) \rightarrow \text{Na}^+(aq)+\text{NO}^-_3(aq)+\text{AgCl}(s)
If you look carefully at the ionic equation, you will notice that the sodium ion and the nitrate ion appear unchanged on both sides of the equation.
When the two solutions are mixed, neither the Na + nor the NO 3 âˆ’ ions participate in the reaction.
They can be eliminated from the reaction.
\cancel{\text{Na}^ + (aq)}+\text{Cl}^-(aq)+\text{Ag}^ + (aq)+\cancel{\text{NO}^-_3(aq)} \rightarrow \cancel{\text{Na}^+(aq)} + \cancel{\text{NO}^-_3(aq)} + \text{AgCl}(s)
A spectator ion is an ion that does not take part in the chemical reaction and is found in solution both before and after the reaction.
In the above reaction, the sodium ion and the nitrate ion are both spectator ions.
The equation can now be written without the spectator ions.
\text{Ag}^+(aq)+\text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s)
The net ionic equation is the chemical equation that shows only those elements, compounds, and ions that are directly involved in the chemical reaction.
Notice that in writing the net ionic equation, the positively-charged silver cation was written first on the reactant side, followed by the negatively-charged chloride anion.
This is somewhat customary because that is the order in which the ions must be written in the silver chloride product.
However, it is not absolutely necessary to order the reactants in this way.
Net ionic equations must be balanced by both mass and charge.
Balancing by mass means making sure that there are equal numbers of each element.
Balancing by charge means making sure that the overall charge is the same on both sides of the equation.
