People began to move into cities.
Where the Industrial Revolution was taking place, the human population started to grow really fast.
The birth rate was always high.
What changed was the death rate.
The population grew because more people stayed alive.
The death rate fell for several reasons:
New farm machines were invented.
They increased the amount of food that could be produced.
With more food, people were healthier and could live longer.
Steam engines and railroads were built.
These machines could quickly carry food long distances.
This made food shortages less likely.
Sanitation was improved.
Sewers were dug to carry away human wastes ( Figure below ).
This helped reduce the spread of disease.

Digging a London sewer (1840s).
Before 1800, human wastes were thrown into the streets of cities such as London.
In the early 1800s, sewers were dug to carry away the wastes.
With better food and less chance of disease, the death rate fell.
