Joseph Priestly's bell jar experiment.
During the 20 th century, scientists learned that photosynthesis involves much more than just the three reactants, the three necessary conditions, and the two products shown in the equation.
Using powerful microscopes, scientists narrowed the process to one type of organelle within the plant â€“ the chloroplast.
For a detailed animation of the complete photosynthesis process, see
chlorophyll :
The primary pigment of photosynthesis; found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.
chloroplast :
The organelle of photosynthesis; site of photosynthesis.
enzyme :
Chemical, usually a protein, that speeds up chemical reactions in organisms; a biological catalyst.
The photosynthesis chemical equation states that the reactants (carbon dioxide, water and sunlight), yield two products, glucose and oxygen gas.
The single chemical equation represents the overall process of photosynthesis.
It also summarizes many individual chemical reactions that were understood only after hundreds of years of scientific exploration.
Chloroplasts are the organelles within plant and algal cells that organize enzymes and pigments so that the chemical reactions proceed efficiently.
Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs sunlight energy.
