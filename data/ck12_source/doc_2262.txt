Pictured below are two binary star systems orbiting each other ( Figure below ).
This creates an unusual quadruple star system.
The distance separating the two pairs is about the same as the distance from our Sun to Pluto.

Star clusters are small groups of stars.
A star cluster is smaller than a galaxy.
There are two main types, open clusters and globular clusters.
Both types are held together by gravity.
Open clusters are groups of up to a few thousand stars.
The Jewel Box ( Figure below ), is an open cluster.
Open clusters tend to be blue in color.
They often contain glowing gas and dust.
The stars in an open cluster are young stars that all formed from the same nebula.
These hot blue stars are in an open cluster known as the Jewel Box
These hot blue stars are in an open cluster known as the Jewel Box.
The red star is a young red supergiant.
Globular clusters ( Figure below ) are groups of tens to hundreds of thousands of stars.
Gravity holds these stars tightly together.
