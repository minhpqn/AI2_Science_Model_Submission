There are 5 types of chromosomal alterations: deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and translocations.
Point mutations occur at a single site within the DNA; examples of these include silent mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.
A deletion or insertion in the DNA can alter the reading frame.
Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations may result in altered function of the gene product or protein.
