When the wind drops fine particles of silt and clay, it forms deposits called loess ( Figure below ).
Loess deposits form vertical cliffs.
Loess can become a thick, rich soil.
Thatâ€™s why loess deposits are used for farming in many parts of the world.
Loess hills are like sand dunes made from silt and clay
Loess hills in Missouri are home to the Squaw Creek Wildlife Refuge.
Fine-grained mud in the deep ocean comes from silts and clays brought from the land by wind.
The particles are deposited on the sea surface. they slowly settle to the deep ocean floor, forming brown, greenish, or reddish clays.
Volcanic ash may also settle on the seafloor.
The sand is transported until it is deposited in a sand dune.
Sand is blown up a slope.
Gravity pulls it down the other side.
This is how dunes migrate.
Loess is very fine wind-blown deposits.
