Consider these two examples:
Herbivores such as zebras and elephants live in herds .
Adults in the herd surround and protect the young, who are most vulnerable to predators.
Lions live in social groups called prides .
Adult females in the pride hunt cooperatively, which is more efficient than hunting alone.
Then they share the food with the rest of the pride.
For their part, adult males defend the pride’s territory from other predators.
Locomotion in Mammals
Mammals are noted for the many ways they can move about.
Generally, their limbs are very mobile.
Often, they can be rotated.
Many mammals are also known for their speed.
The fastest land animal is a predatory mammal.
Can you guess what it is?
Racing at speeds of up to 112 kilometers (70 miles) per hour, the cheetah wins hands down.
In addition, the limbs of mammals let them hold their body up above the ground.
That’s because the limbs are attached beneath the body, rather than at the sides as in reptiles (see Figure below ).

The sprawling limbs of a reptile keep it low to the ground.
