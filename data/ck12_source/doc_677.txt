That is, the oscillating fields may be oscillating vertically, horizontally, and in every other direction.
Light typically consists of oscillating fields in all directions, but always travels in a straight line.
Filters can be constructed such that only light with the fields oscillating in a certain direction can pass through the filter.
This is much like having a large number of ropes passing through the slots in a picket fence.
The ropes have transverse waves oscillating in all possible directions moving toward the fence.
When the waves encounter the fence, only the oscillations that are vertical and fit through the slots in the fence will be allowed to pass through.
Light that has all its field oscillations in the same direction is said to be polarized .
Light in the Shadows: the Poisson Spot
The wave theory of light predicts that there should be a bright spot right in the center of the shadow of a spherical object.
This sounds crazy...but is it true?
This MIT video discusses the Poisson Spot, named after the French mathematician Simeon Denis Poisson .

We see objects because they either generate or reflect light, which then enters our eyes.
Visible light is a small fraction of the energy we call electromagnetic radiation.
Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields traveling at the speed of light.
The energy of an electromagnetic wave travels in a straight line along the path of the wave.
In a vacuum, every electromagnetic wave has a velocity of 3.00 \times 10^8 \ m/s , which is symbolized by the lower case c .
The relationship of velocity, wavelength, and frequency of electromagnetic waves is: c = \lambda f .
Light that has all its field oscillations in the same direction is said to be polarized.
