Certain species of plants thrive in wetlands, and they are rich ecosystems.
Freshwater wetlands are usually found at the edges of streams, rivers, ponds, or lakes.
Wetlands can also be found at the edges of seas.
Types of Freshwater Wetlands
Not all wetlands are alike, as you can see below ( Figure below ).
Wetlands vary in how wet they are and how much of the year they are soaked.
Wetlands also vary in the kinds of plants that live in them.
This depends mostly on the climate where the wetland is found.
Types of wetlands include marshes, swamps, and bogs.
A marsh is a wetland that is usually under water.
It has grassy plants, such as cattails.
A swamp is a wetland that may or may not be covered with water but is always soggy.
It has shrubs or trees.
A bog is a wetland that has soggy soil.
It is generally covered with mosses.

These are just three of many types of wetlands.
Importance of Wetlands
People used to think that wetlands were useless.
Many wetlands were filled in with rocks and soil to create solid land.
