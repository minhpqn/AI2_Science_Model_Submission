A toy truck moves off the edge of a table that is 1.25 \;\mathrm{m} high and lands 0.40 \;\mathrm{m} from the base of the table.
How much time passed between the moment the car left the table and the moment it hit the floor?
What was the horizontal velocity of the car when it hit the ground?
A hawk in level flight 135\;\mathrm{m} above the ground drops the fish it caught.
If the hawk’s horizontal speed is 20.0 \;\mathrm{m/s} , how far ahead of the drop point will the fish land?
A pistol is fired horizontally toward a target 120\;\mathrm{m} away, but at the same height.
The bullet’s velocity is 200 \;\mathrm{m/s} .
How long does it take the bullet to get to the target?
How far below the target does the bullet hit?
A bird, traveling at 20 \;\mathrm{m/s} , wants to hit a waiter 10 \;\mathrm{m} below with his dropping (see image).
In order to hit the waiter, the bird must release his dropping some distance before he is directly overhead.
What is this distance?
Joe Nedney of the San Francisco 49ers kicked a field goal with an initial velocity of 20 \;\mathrm{m/s} at an angle of 60^\circ .
How long is the ball in the air?
Hint: you may assume that the ball lands at same height as it starts at.
What are the range and maximum height of the ball?
A racquetball thrown from the ground at an angle of 45^\circ and with a speed of 22.5 \;\mathrm{m/s} lands exactly 2.5 \;\mathrm{s} later on the top of a nearby building.
Calculate the horizontal distance it traveled and the height of the building.
Donovan McNabb throws a football.
He throws it with an initial velocity of 30 \;\mathrm{m/s} at an angle of 25^\circ .
