Active transport is the energy-requiring process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes against a concentration gradient.
Endocytosis is the process of capturing a substance or particle from outside the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane, and bringing it into the cell.
Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell.
Both endocytosis and exocytosis are active transport processes.
