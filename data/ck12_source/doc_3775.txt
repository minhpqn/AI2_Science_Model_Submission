When did the first eukaryotic cells evolve?
Describe the endosymbiotic theory.
Discuss the evidence for the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts.
Late Precambrian Period
Describe geologic and climatic changes of the late Precambrian.
Summarize life during the late Precambrian.
What did early eukaryotic life look like?
Some looked like this.
This is a fossil of an ammonite.
Ammonites are excellent index fossils, and it is often possible to link the rock layer in which they are found to specific geological time periods.
Multicellular Life:
Setting the Stage
Nearly 80% of Earth’s history passed before multicellular life evolved.
Up until then, all organisms existed as single cells.
Why did multicellular organisms evolve?
What led up to this major step in the evolution of life?
To put the evolution of multicellularity in context, let’s return to what was happening on planet Earth during this part of its history.
The Late Precambrian
The late Precambrian is the time from about 2 billion to half a billion years ago.
During this long span of time, Earth experienced many dramatic geologic and climatic changes.
