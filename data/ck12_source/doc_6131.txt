What is the structure for ice?
How many water molecules interact in water?
In ice?
For most liquids, what happens to density as the temperature decreases?
How does the density of water change at temperatures above 4°C?
How does the density of water change below 4°C?
density:  The concentration of a substance.
Increases as its temperature decreases.
hexagonal:
Structured like a hexagon.
Physical Properties of Water
Define surface tension.
Define vapor pressure.
Explain the phsyical properties of water in terms of hydrogen bonding.
An evaporation pan is used to measure the rate at which water evaporates
What is this pan used for?
Water loss to the atmosphere is a significant problem in many parts of the world.  When water supplies are low, anything that can be done to decrease water loss is important for farmers.  An evaporation pan (seen above) can be used to measure how fast water evaporates in a given location.  This information can be used as part of projects to develop ways to cut down on evaporation and increase the amount of usable water in a region.
Properties of Water
Compared to other molecular compounds of relatively low molar mass, ice melts at a very high temperature.  A great deal of energy is required to break apart the hydrogen-bonded network of ice and return it to the liquid state.  Likewise, the boiling point of water is very high.  Most molecular compounds of similar molar mass are gases at room temperature.
Water has a high surface tension (attraction between molecules at the surface of a liquid) because of its hydrogen bonding.  Liquids that cannot hydrogen bond do not exhibit nearly as much surface tension.
