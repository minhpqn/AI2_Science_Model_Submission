The net charge is 24+ on both sides.
The equation is balanced.
The half-reaction method of balancing redox equations is described.

half-reaction method:
Each half-reaction is balanced separately and then the two half-reactions are merged for final balancing.
Half-Reaction Method in Basic Solution
Use the half-reaction method to balance redox equations in basic solution.
Cyanide is destroyed by chlorine gas in basic solution
How do you remove cyanide from water ?
Cyanide is a very toxic material.
Generated mainly by industrial manufacturing processes, this anion can cause neurological effects and damage to sensitive tissues such as the thyroid gland.
Treatment with chlorine gas in basic solution effectively destroys any cyanide present by converting it to harmless nitrogen gas.
The reaction is as follows:
2 \text{NaCN}+5 \text{Cl}_2 +12 \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{N}_2 + 2\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + 10\text{NaCl} + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}
Half-Reaction Method in Basic Solution
For reactions that occur in basic solution rather than acidic solution, the steps to balance the reaction are primarily the same.
