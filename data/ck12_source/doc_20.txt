The most powerful light microscopes can make images up to 2,000 times larger.
Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) focus a beam of electrons through an object and can make an image up to two million times bigger, with a very clear image.
Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) allow scientists to find the shape and surface texture of extremely small objects, including a paperclip, a bedbug, or even an atom.
These microscopes slide a beam of electrons across the surface of a specimen, producing detailed maps of the surface of objects.
Magnification in a SEM can be controlled over a range from about 10 to 500,000 times.
Scanning acoustic microscopes use sound waves to scan a specimen.
These microscopes are useful in biology and medical research.
A Scanning Electron Microscope
A scanning electron microscope.
A microscope is a tool used to make things that are too small to be seen by the naked eye look bigger.
Types of microscopes include light microscopes, transmission electron microscopes (TEM), scanning electron microscopes (SEM), and scanning acoustic microscopes.
