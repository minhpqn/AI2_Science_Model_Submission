The tablet is disappearing in the glass of water because it is dissolving into particles that are too small to see.
The lighthouse is becoming coated with ice as ocean spray freezes on its surface.
This is another change of state.
Reversing Physical Changes
When matter undergoes physical change, it doesn’t become a different substance.
Therefore, physical changes are often easy to reverse.
For example, when liquid water freezes to form ice, it can be changed back to liquid water by heating and melting the ice.
Q:
Salt dissolving in water is a physical change.
How could this change be reversed?
A:
The salt water could be boiled until the water evaporates, leaving behind the salt.
Water vapor from the boiling water could be captured and cooled.
The water vapor would condense and change back to liquid water.
A physical change in matter is a change in one or more of matter’s physical properties.
In a physical change, matter may change its size, shape, or state, but its chemical properties do not change.
Because the chemical properties of matter remain the same in a physical change, a physical change is often easy to reverse.
