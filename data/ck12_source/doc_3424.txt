An experiment generally tests how one variable is affected by another.
The affected variable is called the dependent variable .
In the plant experiment shown above, the dependent variable is plant growth.
The variable that affects the dependent variable is called the independent variable .
In the plant experiment, the independent variable could be fertilizerâ€”some plants will get fertilizer, others will not.
The scientists change the amount of the independent variable (the fertilizer) to observe the effects on the dependent variable (plant growth).
An experiment needs to be run simultaneously in which no fertilizer is given to the plant.
This would be known as a control experiment.  In any experiment, other factors that might affect the dependent variable must be controlled.
In the plant experiment, what factors do you think should be controlled? ( Hint:
What other factors might affect plant growth?)
Sample Size and Repetition
The sample in an experiment or other investigation consists of the individuals or events that are studied, and the size of the sample (or sample size ) directly affects the interpretation of the results.
Typically, the sample is much smaller than all such individuals or events that exist in the world.
Whether the results based on the sample are true in general cannot be known for certain.
However, the larger the sample is, the more likely it is that the results are generally true.
Similarly, the more times that an experiment is repeated (which is known as repetition ) and the same results obtained, the more likely the results are valid.
This is why scientific experiments should always be repeated.
