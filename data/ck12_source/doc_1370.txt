Eventually, the magma reaches the surface and erupts through a vent ( Figure below ).
Effusive eruptions are common in Hawaii, where lavas are mafic.
In effusive eruptions, lava flows readily, producing rivers of molten rock

The Kilauea volcanic eruption in 2008 is seen in this short video:  .
A Quicktime movie with thermal camera of a lava stream within the vent of a Hawaiian volcano is seen here:
Effusive Eruptions Damage
Effusive eruptions rarely kill anyone because they move slowly.
People can usually be evacuated before an effusive eruption.
Still, effusive eruptions can be destructive.
There is not much anyone can do to stop a lava flow from destroying a building or road ( Figure below ).

Mafic magma creates effusive eruptions.
The pressure builds but the lava flows fairly quietly.
Effusive eruptions cause damage but rarely kill anyone.
Mafic magma cools into different types of flows like a'a, pƒÅhoehoe, and pillow lava.
