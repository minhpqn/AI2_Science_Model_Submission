Is this statement testable?
Yes.
You could drop two objects at the same time from the same height and observe when they reach the ground.
Of course, you would have to drop the objects in the absence of air to prevent air resistance, but at least such a test is theoretically possible.
Is the statement falsifiable if it really is false?
Again, the answer is yes.
You can easily test many combinations of two objects and if any two objects do not reach the ground at the same time, then the hypothesis is false.
If a hypothesis really is false, it should be relatively easy to disprove it.
Elephant and boy falling to the ground due to gravity
Both the elephant and the boy are falling to the ground because of gravity.
The force of gravity (F grav ) is greater for the elephant than it is for the boy because the elephant is much more massive.
Nonetheless, both of them will reach the ground at the same time (assuming they fall from the same height at the same time and there is no air resistance.)
Can You Prove a Hypothesis Is True?
If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false, it is likely that this would be discovered sooner or later after enough objects had been dropped.
It takes just one exception to disprove a hypothesis.
But what if the hypothesis really is true?
Can this be demonstrated as well?
No; it would require testing all possible combinations of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the same time.
This is impossible.
New objects are being made all the time that would have to be tested.
