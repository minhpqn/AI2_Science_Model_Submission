Silver is a mineral made only of silver atoms.
Diamond and graphite are both made only of the element carbon.
Minerals that are not just a single element are made of chemical compounds.
For example, the mineral quartz is made of the compound silicon dioxide, or SiO 2 .
This compound has one atom of the element silicon for every two atoms of the element oxygen.
Each mineral has its own unique chemical formula.
For example, the mineral hematite has two iron atoms for every three oxygen atoms.
The mineral magnetite has three iron atoms for every four oxygen atoms.
Many minerals have very complex chemical formulas that include several elements.
However, even in more complicated compounds, the elements occur in definite ratios.
Minerals must be solid.
For example, ice and water have the same chemical composition.
Ice is a solid, so it is a mineral.
Water is a liquid, so it is not a mineral.
Some solids are not crystals.
Glass, or the rock obsidian, are solid.
However, they are not crystals.
In a crystal , the atoms are arranged in a pattern.
This pattern is regular and it repeats.
The image below shows how the atoms are arranged in halite (table salt) ( Figure below ).
