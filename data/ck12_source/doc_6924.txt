Current is the number of Coulomb's that flow by per second.
Thus 1 Amp of current is equivalent to saying that 1 C of electric charge is passing every second (i.e. the rate of change of charge is 1 C/s).
Voltage is the electrical energy density (energy divided by charge) and differences in this density (voltage) cause electric current in the circuit.
Batteries and power supplies often provide a voltage difference across the ends of a circuit, but other voltage sources exist.
Using the water analogy that current is a river, then differences in voltage can be thought of as pipes coming out of a water dam at different heights.
The lower the pipe along the dam wall, the larger the water pressure, thus the higher the voltage.
If that pipe is connected then current will flow.
Current will be larger for the pipe with the greatest pressure (i.e. the lowest pipe on the dam wall).
Somehow, you are able to see the electrons passing through a wire as current flows.
Over the course of 5 seconds, you count 1.5*10^{20} electrons pass a single point in the wire.
How much charge passed you and the current in the wire?
We can use the known charge of an electron to answer the first part of this problem.
Now we use the equation above to determine the current
I&=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}\\\I&=\frac{24\:\text{C}}{5\:\text{s}}\\\I&=4.8\:\text{A}\\\
