Water pollution may come from more than one source, too.
For example, chemicals may rain from the air into that same stream.
It is much more difficult to control pollution from more than one source.
In the developed nations there are three main sources of water pollution:
Municipal, or community.
Chemicals that are applied to farm fields include fertilizers and pesticides.
Excess chemicals can be picked up by rainwater.
The chemicals can end up in streams, ponds, lakes, or the ocean.
Dissolved fertilizer causes tremendous numbers of water plants and algae to grow.
This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes or the coastal oceans.
Waste from livestock can also pollute water.
The waste contains pathogens that can cause diseases.
Many farms in the U.S. have thousands of animals.
These farms produce millions of gallons of waste.
The waste is stored in huge lagoons, like the one pictured below ( Figure below ).
Many leaks from these lagoons have occurred.

Factories and power plants may pollute water with harmful substances.
