The shell is made of chitin , a tough, semitransparent substance.
A mass housing the organs.
A complete digestive tract that begins at the mouth and runs to the anus.
Most ocean mollusks have a gill or gills to absorb oxygen from the water.
Many species have a feeding structure, the radula , found only in mollusks.
The radula can be thought of as a "tongue-like" structure.
The radula is made mostly of chitin.
Types of radulae range from structures used to scrape algae off of rocks to the beaks of squid and octopuses.
The basic body plan of a mollusk
This is the basic body plan of a mollusk.
Note the mantle, gills, and radula.
Keep in mind the basic body plan can differ slightly among the mollusks.
Evolution of Mollusks
Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum Annelida , also known as segmented worms.
This phylum includes the earthworm and leech.
Scientists believe these two groups are related because, when they are in the early stage of development, they look very similar.
Mollusks also share features of their organ systems with segmented worms.
Unlike segmented worms, however, mollusks do not have body segmentation.
The basic mollusk body shape is usually quite different as well.
The mollusk body often has a head with tentacles, a muscular foot, a feeding organ called the radula, and a complete digestive tract.
