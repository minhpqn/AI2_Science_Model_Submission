We can solve this problem using the equation given above relating kinetic energy to the temperature of a gas.
\frac{1}{2}mv^2&=\frac{3}{2}kT\\\v&=\sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}\\\v&=\sqrt{\frac{3*1.38*10^{-23}\;\text{J/K} * 100\;\text{K}}{3.34*10^{-26}\;\text{kg}}}\\\v&=352.1\;\text{m/s}\\\
Convert the boiling point of water  100^\circ \text{C}  to Fahrenheit
Convert  70^\circ \text{F}  to Celsius
The temperature of the box is related to the average speed of the molecules.
Use momentum principles to relate temperature to pressure.
Explain conceptually, in words rather than with equations.
Explain why a lake freezes at the top first, rather than throughout or at the bottom?
Typical room temperature is about 300 \;\mathrm{K} .
As you know, the air in the room contains both O_2 and N_2 gases, with nitrogen the lower mass of the two.
If the average kinetic energies of the oxygen and nitrogen gases are the same (since they are at the same temperature), which gas has a higher average speed?
Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules.
Consider a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas at a certain temperature.
Use the formula for kinetic energy to explain why the hydrogen molecules move faster than the oxygen molecules.
Then explain why there’s no hydrogen in the earth’s atmosphere, and why the moon has no atmosphere at all.
Calculate the average speed of N_2 molecules at room temperature (300 \;\mathrm{K}) . (You remember from your chemistry class how to calculate the mass (in kg ) of an N_2 molecule, right?)
How high would the temperature of a sample of O_2 gas molecules have to be so that the average speed of the molecules would be 10 % the speed of light?
Convert this temperature to Kelvin and Fahrenheit as well.
