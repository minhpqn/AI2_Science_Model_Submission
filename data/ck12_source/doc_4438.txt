What else was happening at that time?
One change was a drop in Earth’s temperature.
This may have favored endothermic mammals over ectothermic dinosaurs.
Flowering plants were also spreading at that time.
They may have provided new and plentiful foods for small mammals or their insect prey.
The supertree also shows that another major diversification of mammals occurred about 50 million years ago.
Again, worldwide climate change may have been one reason.
This time Earth’s temperature rose.
The warmer temperature led to a greater diversity of plants.
This would have meant more food for mammals or their prey.
The mammalian supertree shows that placental mammals started to diversify as early as 95 million years ago.
