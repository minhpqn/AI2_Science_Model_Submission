A:
The solar car could not exist without the solar cell.
This invention provided a way to convert light energy to electricity that could be used to run a device such as a car.
Q:
The 1955 “Sunmobile” was just a model car.
It was too small for people to drive.
Why was it an important achievement in the evolution of solar car technology?
A:
The car wasn’t practical, but it was a working solar car.
It showed people that solar car technology is possible.
It spurred others, including Hans Tholstrup, to work on solar cars that people could actually drive.
Q:
How have the World Solar Challenge races influenced the development of solar cars?
A:
The races have drawn a lot of attention to solar car development.
The challenge of winning a race has also stimulated developers to keep improving the performance of solar cars so they can go faster and farther on solar power alone.
Technology is the application of science to solve practical problems.
Technology evolves as new materials, designs, and processes are invented.
