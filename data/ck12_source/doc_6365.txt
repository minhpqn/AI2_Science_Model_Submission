The change in Gibbs free energy is equal to the change in enthalpy minus the mathematical product of the change in entropy multiplied by the Kelvin temperature.
Each thermodynamic quantity in the equation is for substances in their standard states.
The usual units for \Delta H is kJ/mol, while \Delta S is often reported in J/K • mol.
It is necessary to change the units for \Delta S to kJ/K • mol, so that the calculation of \Delta G is in kJ/mol.
A spontaneous reaction is one that releases free energy, and so the sign of \Delta G must be negative.
Since both \Delta H and \Delta S can be either positive or negative, depending on the characteristics of the particular reaction, there are four different general outcomes for \Delta G and these are outlined in the Table below :
Enthalpy, Entropy, and Free Energy Changes
− value (exothermic)
+ value (disordering)
+ value (endothermic)
+ value (disordering)
negative at higher temperatures
− value (exothermic)
− value (ordering)
negative at lower temperatures
+ value (endothermic)
− value (ordering)
Keep in mind that the temperature in the Gibbs free energy equation is the Kelvin temperature and so can only be positive.
When \Delta H is negative and \Delta S is positive, the sign of \Delta G will always be negative, and the reaction will be spontaneous at all temperatures.
This corresponds to both driving forces being in favor of product formation.
