The formula for ethanol is CH 3 CH 2 OH.
What is the mole ratio of H to C in this molecule?
mole ratio:
A conversion factor that relates the amounts in moles of any two substances in a chemical reaction.
Mass-Mole and Mole-Mass Stoichiometry
Perform calculations involving conversions of mass to moles.
Perform calculations involving conversions of moles to mass.
Calculating the number of nails you need requires stoichiometry
When you are doing a large construction project, you have a good idea of how many nails you will need (lots!).
When you go to the hardware store, you don’t want to sit there and count out several hundred nails.
You can buy nails by weight, so you determine how many nails are in a pound, calculate how many pounds you need, and you’re on your way to begin building.
While the mole ratio is ever-present in all stoichiometry calculations, amounts of substances in the laboratory are most often measured by mass.
Therefore, we need to use mole-mass calculations in combination with mole ratios to solve several different types of mass-based stoichiometry problems.
Mass to Moles Problems
In this type of problem, the mass of one substance is given, usually in grams.
From this, you are to determine the amount in moles of another substance that will either react with or be produced from the given substance.
\text{mass of} \ given \rightarrow \text{moles of} \ given \rightarrow \text{moles of} \ unknown
The mass of the given substance is converted into moles by use of the molar mass of that substance from the periodic table.
Then, the moles of the given substance are converted into moles of the unknown by using the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation.
