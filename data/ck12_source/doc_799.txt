Individuals are not members of the same species if their members cannot produce offspring that can also have children.
The second word in the two word name given to every organism is the species name.
For example, in Homo sapiens , sapiens is the species name.
A population is a group of organisms belonging to the same species that live in the same area and interact with one another.
A community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another.
A community is composed of all of the biotic factors of an area.
An ecosystem includes the living organisms (all the populations) in an area and the non-living aspects of the environment ( Figure below ).
An ecosystem is made of the biotic and abiotic factors in an area.
The Great Barrier Reef is an example of a marine ecosystem

The biosphere is the part of the planet with living organisms ( Figure below ).
The biosphere includes most of Earth, including part of the oceans and the atmosphere.
The global biosphere includes all areas that contain life
The global biosphere, which includes all areas that contain life, from the sea to the atmosphere.
Ecologists study ecosystems at every level, from the individual organism to the whole ecosystem and biosphere.
They can ask different types of questions at each level.
Examples of these questions are given in Table below , using the zebra ( Equus zebra ) as an example.
How do zebras keep water in their bodies?
What causes the growth of a zebra populations?
How does a disturbance, like a fire or predator, affect the number of mammal species in African grasslands?
