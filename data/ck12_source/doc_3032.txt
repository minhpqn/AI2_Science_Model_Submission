The SI unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa), or N/m 2 .
To calculate pressure, divide force in Newtons (N) by area in square meters (m 2 ).

Why does the liquid move into the siphon when air is removed from the siphon by the pipette?
How does the liquid flow uphill out of the upper cup?
Why doesnâ€™t the liquid in the siphon flow back down into the upper cup as well as down into the lower cup?
Why do fluids exert pressure?
Explain how a pushpin concentrates the force you apply to it.
What is the SI unit for pressure?
A large box weighing 700 N is resting on the ground on an area of 1 m 2 .
How much pressure is the box exerting on the ground?
What factors influence fluid pressure?
Explain how and why water pressure changes with depth in the ocean.
Describe how water pressure affects ocean exploration.
In 2012, the film director James Cameron, who directed the film Titanic, made headlines when he traveled to Challenger Deep.
This is the deepest known point on the ocean floor, almost 11,000 meters below the surface.
Cameron was the first person to travel there alone, and he made the trip in a deep-sea diving vehicle named Deepsea Challenger.
The vehicle pictured above is another deep-sea diving vehicle, named Alvin.
