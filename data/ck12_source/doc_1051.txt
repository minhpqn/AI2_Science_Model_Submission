There are many branches of oceanography.
Physical oceanography is the study of water movement, like waves and ocean currents.
Physical oceanographers ask when or if a tsunami will hit a shoreline.
Marine geologists look at rocks and structures in the ocean basins.
These scientists ask how new ocean crust forms.
Chemical oceanographers study the natural elements in ocean water.
Chemical oceanographers might be concerned with where carbon dioxide goes in the oceans.
Marine biologists look at marine life.
There are lots of questions to ask about marine life!
