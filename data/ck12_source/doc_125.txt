Bird feet can also vary greatly among different birds.
Some birds, such as gulls and terns and other waterfowl, have webbed feet used for swimming or floating ( Figure below ).
Other birds, such as herons, gallinules, and rails, have four long spreading toes, which are adapted for walking delicately in the wetlands ( Figure below ).
You can predict how the beaks and feet of birds will look depending on where they live and what type of food they eat.
Flightless birds also have long legs that are adapted for running.
Flightless birds include the ostrich and kiwi.
Raptors have clawed feet.
They also have strong legs.
Hawks, eagles and falcons also have excellent vision and they hunt by sight.
