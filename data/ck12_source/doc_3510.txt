The ability to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as selective permeability or semipermeability .
To understand how the plasma membrane controls what crosses into or out of the cell, you need to know its composition.
The plasma membrane is discussed at
A Phospholipid Bilayer
The plasma membrane is composed mainly of phospholipids, which consist of fatty acids and alcohol.
The phospholipids in the plasma membrane are arranged in two layers, called a phospholipid bilayer .
As shown in Figure below , each phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails.
The head “loves” water ( hydrophilic ) and the tails “hate” water ( hydrophobic ).
The water-hating tails are on the interior of the membrane, whereas the water-loving heads point outwards, toward either the cytoplasm or the fluid that surrounds the cell.
Molecules that are hydrophobic can easily pass through the plasma membrane, if they are small enough, because they are water-hating like the interior of the membrane.
Molecules that are hydrophilic, on the other hand, cannot pass through the plasma membrane—at least not without help—because they are water-loving like the exterior of the membrane, and are therefore excluded from the interior of the membrane.
The phospholipid bilayer, the structure of the plasma membrane
Phospholipid Bilayer.
The phospholipid bilayer consists of two layers of phospholipids, with a hydrophobic, or water-hating, interior and a hydrophilic, or water-loving, exterior.
The hydrophilic (polar) head group and hydrophobic tails (fatty acid chains) are depicted in the single phospholipid molecule.
The polar head group and fatty acid chains are attached by a 3-carbon glycerol unit.

The plasma membrane forms a barrier between the cytoplasm and the environment outside the cell.
The plasma membrane has selective permeability.
