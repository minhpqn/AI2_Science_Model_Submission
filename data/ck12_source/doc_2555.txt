However, it doesn’t explain certain behaviors of electrons, except for those in the simplest atom, the hydrogen atom.

What Are the Chances?
In the mid-1920s, an Austrian scientist named Erwin Schrödinger thought that the problem with Bohr’s model was restricting the electrons to specific orbits.
He wondered if electrons might behave like light, which scientists already knew had properties of both particles and waves.
Schrödinger speculated that electrons might also travel in waves.
At the URLs below, you can see how some of these waves might look.
Q:
How do you pin down the location of an electron in a wave?
A:
You can’t specify the exact location of an electron.
However, Schrödinger showed that you can at least determine where an electron is most likely to be.
Schrödinger developed an equation that could be used to calculate the chances of an electron being in any given place around the nucleus.
Based on his calculations, he identified regions around the nucleus where electrons are most likely to be.
He called these regions orbitals .
As you can see in the Figure below , orbitals may be shaped like spheres, dumbbells, or rings.
In each case, the nucleus of the atom is at the center of the orbital.
