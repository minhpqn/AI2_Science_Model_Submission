Lipids - Advanced
Describe the structure and function of lipids.
Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.
Name and describe various types of lipids.
Oil.
Does it mix with water?
No.
Biologically, why is this important?
Oil is a lipid.
The property of chemically not being able to mix with water gives lipids some very important biological functions.
A particular type of lipid - the phospholipid - is the main component of the outer membrane of all cells.
Why?
Lipids are organic compounds that contain mainly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
They include substances such as fats and oils, as well as waxes, sterols, some vitamins (A, D, E and K) and phospholipids.
Lipid molecules consist of fatty acids, with or without additional molecules.
Fatty acids are organic compounds that have the general formula CH 3 (CH 2 ) n COOH, where n usually ranges from 2 to 28 and is always an even number.
A distinguishing feature of lipids is that they are insoluble in water.
The main biological functions of lipids include energy storage, as the major structural component of cell membranes, and as important signaling molecules.
Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids
Fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated.
