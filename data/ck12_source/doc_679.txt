Visible light (commonly referred to simply as light) is electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye, and is responsible for the sense of sight.
Visible light has a wavelength in the range of about 380 nanometres to about 740 nm â€“ between the invisible infrared and the invisible ultraviolet.
spectrum:
The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
transparent:
Capable of transmitting light so that objects or images can be seen as if there were no intervening material.
translucent:
Transmitting light but causing sufficient diffusion to prevent perception of distinct images.
opaque:
Impenetrable by light; neither transparent nor translucent.
luminous:
Emitting self-generated light.
illuminated:
An object upon which electromagnetic radiation from some source is falling.
polarized light:
A phenomenon in which the waves of light or other electromagnetic radiation are restricted to certain directions of vibration, usually specified in terms of the electric field vector.
Reflection of Light
State the law of reflection.
Describe the difference between regular and diffuse reflection.
