The general cases below illustrate entropy at the molecular level.
For a given substance, the entropy of the liquid state is greater than the entropy of the solid state.
Likewise, the entropy of the gas is greater than the entropy of the liquid.
Therefore, entropy increases in processes in which solid or liquid reactants form gaseous products.
Entropy also increases when solid reactants form liquid products.
Entropy increases when a substance is broken up into multiple parts.
The process of dissolving increases entropy because the solute particles become separated from one another when a solution is formed.
Entropy increases as temperature increases.
An increase in temperature means that the particles of the substance have greater kinetic energy.
The faster moving particles have more disorder than particles that are moving more slowly at a lower temperature.
Entropy generally increases in reactions in which the total number of product molecules is greater than the total number of reactant molecules.
An exception to this rule is when a gas is being produced from nongaseous reactants.
The examples below will serve to illustrate how the entropy change in a reaction can be predicted.
\text{Cl}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(l)
The entropy is decreasing because a gas is becoming a liquid.
\text{CaCO}_3(s) \rightarrow \text{CaO}(s)+\text{CO}_ 2(g)
The entropy is increasing because a gas is being produced and the number of molecules is increasing.
\text{N}_2(g)+3\text{H}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3(g)
The entropy is decreasing because four total reactant molecules are forming two total product molecules.
All are gases.
