Solve problems involving Coulomb's Law.
Students will learn how to solve problems involving Coulomb's Law.
F = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2}\begin{cases}k & \text{The electric constant,}\ k = 8.987 \times 10^9 \ \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 C^{-2}}. \\\q_1, \ q_2 & \text{Magnitude of the charges, units of Coulombs (C)}\\\r & \text{Distance between charges, m}\end{cases}
The Coulomb Force Law states that any two charged particles (q_1,q_2)  --- with charge measured in units of Coulombs --- at a distance  r  from each other will experience a force of repulsion or attraction along the line joining them equal to:
\vec{F_e} &= \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} && \text{The Coulomb Force [1]}\intertext{Where} k &= 8.987 \times 10^9 \ \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2}} && \text{The Electric Constant}
This looks a lot like the Law of Universal Gravitation, which deals with attraction between objects with mass.
The big difference is that while any two masses experience mutual attraction , two charges can either attract or repel each other, depending on whether the signs of their charges are alike:
Like gravitational (and all other) forces, Coulomb forces add as vectors.
Thus to find the force on a charge from an arrangement of charges, one needs to find the vector sum of the force from each charge in the arrangement.
Question :
Two negatively charged spheres (one with -12\mu\mathrm{C} ; the other with -3\mu\mathrm{C} ) are 3\mathrm{m} apart.
Where could you place an electron so that it will be suspended in space between them with a net force of zero (for this problem we will ignore the force of repulsion between the two charges because they are held in place)?
Answer :
Consider the diagram above; here  r_{s\rightarrow e}  is the distance between the electron and the small charge, while \vec{F}_{s\rightarrow e}  is the force the electron feels due to it.
For the electron to be balanced in between the two charges, the forces of repulsion caused by the two charges on the electron would have to be balanced.
To do this, we will set the equation for the force exerted by two charges on each other equal and solve for a distance ratio.
We will denote the difference between the charges through the subscripts "s" for the smaller charge, "e" for the electron, and "l" for the larger charge.
