Even with only four different bases, the number of possible nucleotide sequences in a DNA chain is virtually limitless.
The particular DNA sequence of a particular organism constitutes the genetic blueprint for that organism.  This genetic blueprint is found in the nucleus of each cell of the organism and is passed on from parents to offspring.
The incredible diversity of life on Earth stems from the differences in the genetic code of every living thing.
A gene is defined.
The genetic code is described.
