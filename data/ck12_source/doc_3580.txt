Anaerobic vs Aerobic Respiration
Distinguish aerobic from anaerobic.
Define aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
How long can you hold your breath?
With or without air?
In terms of producing energy, that is the key question.
Can cellular respiration occur without air?
It can, but it does have limitations.
The Presence of Oxygen
There are two types of cellular respiration (see Cellular Respiration concept): aerobic and anaerobic.
One occurs in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic ), and one occurs in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobic ).
Both begin with glycolysis - the splitting of glucose.
Glycolysis (see "Glycolysis" concept) is an anaerobic process - it does not need oxygen to proceed.
This process produces a minimal amount of ATP.
The Krebs cycle and electron transport do need oxygen to proceed, and in the presence of oxygen, these process produce much more ATP than glycolysis alone.
Scientists think that glycolysis evolved before the other stages of cellular respiration.
This is because the other stages need oxygen, whereas glycolysis does not, and there was no oxygen in Earthâ€™s atmosphere when life first evolved about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago.
Cellular respiration that proceeds without oxygen is called anaerobic respiration .
Then, about 2 or 3 billion years ago, oxygen was gradually added to the atmosphere by early photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria).
