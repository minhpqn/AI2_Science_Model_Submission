B.
Ammonium ion and nitrate ion are 1+ and 1− respectively, while barium and sulfate are 2+ and 2−.
This must be taken into account when exchanging partners and writing the new formulas.
Then, the equation is balanced.
(\text{NH}_4)_2\text{SO}_4 (aq)+\text{Ba(NO}_3)_2(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_4\text{NO}_3(aq)+\text{BaSO}_4(s)
Step 3:
Think about your result
Both are double-replacement reactions.
All formulas are correct and the equations are balanced.
Occasionally, a reaction will produce both a gas and a molecular compound.
The reaction of a sodium carbonate solution with hydrochloric acid produces aqueous sodium chloride, carbon dioxide gas, and water.
\text{Na}_2 \text{CO}_3 (aq)+2\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl}(aq)+\text{CO}_2(g)+\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
The double-replacement reaction is described.
Examples of the double-replacement reaction are shown.
