There are four iron atoms in the reactants.
There are also four iron atoms in the products (two in each of the two iron oxide molecules).
Now count the oxygen atoms.
There are six on each side of the arrow, confirming that the equation is balanced in terms of oxygen as well as iron.
Scientists use chemical equations to summarize what happens in chemical reactions.
Reactants are placed on the left side of the equation and products are placed on the right.
An arrow is used to indicate the direction in which the reaction occurs.
Plus signs (+) are placed between multiple reactants or products.
In chemical equations, reactants and products are represented by chemical symbols and formulas.
Numbers called coefficients are placed in front of the symbols and formulas to show how much of each substance is involved in the reaction.
Chemical equations must be balanced.
A balanced equation has the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation.
