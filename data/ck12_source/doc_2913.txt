For each gene, an organism has two alleles, one on each chromosome of a homologous pair of chromosomes (think of it as one allele from Mom, one allele from Dad).
The genotype is represented by letter combinations, such as TT , Tt , and tt .
When an organism has two of the same alleles for a specific gene, it is homozygous ( homo means "same") for that gene.
An organism can be either homozygous dominant (TT) or homozygous recessive (tt).
If an organism has two different alleles (Tt) for a certain gene, it is known as heterozygous ( hetero means different).
Two of the same allele
TT or tt
One dominant allele and one recessive allele
Two dominant alleles
Two recessive alleles
Phenotype is a way to describe the traits you can see.
The genotype is like a recipe for a cake, while the phenotype is like the cake made from the recipe.
The genotype expresses the phenotype.
For example, the phenotypes of Mendel’s pea plants were either tall or short, or they were purple-flowered or white-flowered.
Can organisms with different genotypes have the same phenotypes?
Let’s see.
What is the phenotype of a pea plant that is homozygous dominant (TT) for the tall trait?
Tall.
What is the phenotype of a pea plant that is heterozygous (Tt)?
It is also tall.
