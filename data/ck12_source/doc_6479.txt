For example, if only a zinc half-cell were constructed, no complete redox reaction can occur and so no electrical potential can be measured.
It is only when another half-cell is combined with the zinc half-cell that an electrical potential difference, or voltage, can be measured.
The electrical potential of a cell results from a competition for electrons.
In a zinc-copper voltaic cell, it is the copper(II) ions that will be reduced to copper metal.
That is because the Cu 2+ ions have a greater attraction for electrons than the Zn 2+ ions in the other half-cell.
Instead, the zinc metal is oxidized.
The reduction potential is a measure of the tendency of a given half-reaction to occur as a reduction in an electrochemical cell.
In a given voltaic cell, the half-cell that has the greater reduction potential is the one in which reduction will occur.
In the half-cell with the lower reduction potential, oxidation will occur.
The cell potential (E cell )  is the difference in reduction potential between the two half-cells in an electrochemical cell.
Definitions for types of electrical potential are given.
