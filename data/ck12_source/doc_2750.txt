Cytochrome C is found in all living organisms, with only slight variations between species
Structure of Biochemical Molecules
All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon.
They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur.
Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers.
Polymers are large molecules that consist of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers.
Glucose is a monomer of biochemical compounds called starches.
In starches and all other biochemical polymers, monomers are joined together by covalent bonds, in which atoms share pairs of valence electrons.
Size of Biochemical Molecules
Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules.
The prefix macro- means “large,” and many biochemical molecules are very large indeed.
They may contain thousands of monomer molecules.
The largest known biochemical molecule is called titin.
It plays an important role in muscle contraction.
The human form of the molecule contains more than 34,000 monomers.
Its chemical formula is C 169723 H 270464 N 45688 O 52243 S 912 .
Its chemical name contains almost 190,000 letters, and it has been called the longest word in any language.
Its chemical name is read rapidly in the video at the following URL—and the video lasts more than 8 minutes!
Classes of Biochemical Compounds
Although there are millions of biochemical compounds, all of them can be grouped into just four main classes: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.
