Importance of Fungi for Human Use
Yeasts are crucial for the fermentation process that makes beer, wine, and bread.
Fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen and allows the first step of cellular respiration, glycolysis, to continue.
Some fungi are used in the production of soy sauce and tempeh, a source of protein used in Southeast Asia.
Fungi can produce antibiotics , such as penicillin.
Antibiotics are important medicines that kill bacteria, and penicillin was the first identified cure against many deadly bacterial species.
Antibiotics only treat bacterial diseases; they can not be used to treat viral or fungal diseases.
Mushrooms are fungi that are eaten by people all over the globe.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a single-celled fungus called brewer's or baker's yeast, is used in the baking of bread and in making wine and beer through fermentation.
The video Bread Mold Kills Bacteria at explains Alexander Fleming's famous discovery that lead to the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin.
Antibiotics are used to kill harmful bacteria.

Edible and Poisonous Fungi
Some of the best known types of fungi are mushrooms, which can be edible or poisonous ( Figure below ).
Many species are grown commercially, but others are harvested from the wild.
When you order a pizza with mushrooms or add them to your salad, you are most likely eating Agaricus bisporus , known as white or button mushrooms, the most commonly eaten species.
Other mushroom species are gathered from the wild for people to eat or for commercial sale.
