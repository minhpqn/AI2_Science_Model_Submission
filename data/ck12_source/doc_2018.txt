Some benthos live near vents on the deep ocean floor.
Tubeworms are an example ( Figure below ).
Scalding hot water pours out of the vents.
The hot water contains chemicals that some specialized bacteria can use to make food.
Tubeworms have the bacteria living inside them.
The bacteria get protection and the tubeworms get some of the food.
