Youâ€™ve probably used objects like these many times.
The photos show a TV remote (left) and a calculator (right).
Both of them run on electric current.
Current requires a source of voltage, which is a difference in electric potential energy.
Q:
The source of voltage is different in the remote and the calculator.
Do you know what source of voltage each device uses?
A:
The TV remote uses chemical cells as a source of voltage.
The calculator uses a solar cell.
Chemical cells are found in batteries.
They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions.
Chemical cells have two electrodes, which are strips of different materials, such as zinc and carbon.
The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte.
This is a substance that contains free ions, which can carry electric current.
The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell.
Flashlight batteries contain dry cells.
Car batteries contain wet cells.
The Figure below shows how a battery works.
The diagram represents the simplest type of battery, one that contains a single chemical cell.
