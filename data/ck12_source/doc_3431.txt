It has complex chemistry.
It consists of cells.
Response to the Environment
All living things detect changes in their environment and respond to them.
What happens if you step on a rock?
Nothing; the rock doesn’t respond because it isn’t alive.
But what if you think you are stepping on a rock and actually step on a turtle shell?
The turtle is likely to respond by moving—it may even snap at you!
Growth and Development
All living things grow and develop.
For example, a plant seed may look like a lifeless pebble, but under the right conditions it will grow and develop into a plant.
Animals also grow and develop.
Look at the animals in Figure below .
How will the tadpoles change as they grow and develop into adult frogs?
Tadpoles go through visible changes that show growth and development, a characteristic of life
Tadpoles go through many changes to become adult frogs.
All living things are capable of reproduction.
Reproduction is the process by which living things give rise to offspring.
Reproducing may be as simple as a single cell dividing to form two daughter cells.
Generally, however, it is much more complicated.
