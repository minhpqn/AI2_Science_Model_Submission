Growth and Development of the Fetus
There are also many changes that take place after the embryo becomes a fetus.
Some of the differences between them are obvious.
For example, the fetus has ears and eyelids.
Its fingers and toes are also fully formed.
The fetus even has fingernails and toenails.
In addition, the reproductive organs have developed to make the baby a male or female.
The brain and lungs are also developing quickly.
The fetus has started to move around inside the uterus.
This is usually when the mother first feels the fetus moving.
By the 28 th week, the fetus is starting to look much more like a baby.
Eyelashes and eyebrows are present.
Hair has started to grow on the head.
The body of the fetus is also starting to fill out as muscles and bones develop.
Babies born after the 28 th week are usually able to survive.
However, they need help breathing because their lungs are not yet fully mature.
A baby should not be delivered prior to this time, unless absolutely necessary.
A baby born prior to week 28 will need considerable medical intervention to survive.
During the last several weeks of the fetal period, all of the organs become mature.
The most obvious change, however, is an increase in body size.
