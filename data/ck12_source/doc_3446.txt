It was only when another scientist, named Alfred Russel Wallace, developed essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into print.
Darwin evolution cartoon
Charles Darwin’s name is linked with the theory of evolution.
This cartoon from the 1870s makes fun of both Darwin and his theory.
Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs.
That’s because he knew nothing about genes.
As a result, he didn’t know how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they could change over time.
Evolutionary Theory After Darwin
Since Darwin’s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to support the theory of evolution.
Some of the evidence comes from fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things are to one another.
By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about genes.
As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over time.
Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes of living species.
The more genes different species share in common, the more closely related the species are presumed to be.
Consider humans and chimpanzees.
They share about 98% of their genes.
This means that they shared a common ancestor in the not-too-distant past.
This is just one of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of life on Earth.
Misconceptions About Evolution
Today, evolution is still questioned by some people.
