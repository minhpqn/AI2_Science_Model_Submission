A 3D ground model and its topographic map
Illustrations of three-dimensional ground configurations (top) and corresponding topographic map (bottom).
Note that the V-shaped markings on the topographic maps correspond to drainage channels.
Also, the closely-spaced contour lines denote the rapid rising cliff face on the left side.
Like other maps, topographic maps have a scale so that you can find the horizontal distance .
You can use the horizontal scale to calculate the slope of the land (vertical height/horizontal distance).
Common scales used in United States Geological Service (USGS) maps include the following:
1:24,000 scale – 1 inch = 2000 feet
1:100,000 scale – 1 inch = 1.6 miles
1:250,000 scale – 1 inch = 4 miles
Including contour lines, contour intervals, circles, and V-shapes allows a topographic map to show three-dimensional information on a flat piece of paper.
A topographic map gives us a good idea of the shape of the land.
A geologic map shows the different rocks that are exposed at the surface of a region.
The geology is often put on a contour map.
Rock units are shown in a color identified in a key.
On the geologic map of the Grand Canyon, for example, different rock types are shown in different colors.
Some people call the Grand Canyon “layer cake geology“ because most of the rock units are in layers.
Rock units show up on both sides of a stream valley.
A geologic map looks very complicated in a region where rock layers have been folded.
