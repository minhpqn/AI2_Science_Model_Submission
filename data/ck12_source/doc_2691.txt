Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the equation is balanced.
Q:
Balance this chemical equation for the reaction in which nitrogen (N 2 ) and hydrogen (H 2 ) combine to form ammonia (NH 3 ):
N 2 + H 2 → NH 3
A:
First count the nitrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow.
There are two nitrogen atoms in the reactants so there must be two in the products as well.
Place the coefficient 2 in front of NH 3 to balance nitrogen:
N 2 + H 2 → 2 NH 3
Now count the hydrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow.
There are six hydrogen atoms in the products so there must also be six in the reactants.
Place the coefficient 3 in front of H 2 to balance hydrogen:
N 2 + 3 H 2 → 2 NH 3

A chemical equation represents the changes that occur during a chemical reaction.
It has the general form:
Reactants → Products.
All chemical equations must be balanced.
This means that there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow.
