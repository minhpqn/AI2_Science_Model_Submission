Keep on Moving
Did you ever notice dust motes moving in still air where a beam of sunlight passes through it?
You can see an example in the forest scene in the Figure below .
This sort of observation gave Democritus the idea that atoms are in constant, random motion.
If this were true, Democritus thought, then atoms must always be bumping into each other.
When they do, he surmised, they either bounce apart or stick together to form clumps of atoms.
Eventually, the clumps could grow big enough to be visible matter.

Q:
Which modern theory of matter is similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms?
A:
The modern kinetic theory of matter is remarkably similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms.
According to this theory, atoms of matter are in constant random motion.
This motion is greater in gases than in liquids, and it is greater in liquids than in solids.
But even in solids, atoms are constantly vibrating in place.
Why Matter Varies
Democritus thought that different kinds of matter vary because of the size, shape, and arrangement of their atoms.
For example, he suggested that sweet substances are made of smooth atoms and bitter substances are made of sharp atoms.
He speculated that atoms of liquids are slippery, which allows them to slide over each other and liquids to flow.
