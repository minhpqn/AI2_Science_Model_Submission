Describe and give examples of alternative energy sources.
Can we use up all of our sunlight?
No, we have a limitless supply of sunlight.
That makes it a renewable resource.
Products derived from fossil fuels, like the gasoline we use to drive our cars, are not renewable resources.
We will eventually run out of fossil fuels.
Renewable Resources and Alternative Energy Sources
A resource is renewable if it is remade by natural processes at the same rate that humans use it up.
Sunlight and wind are renewable resources because they will not be used up ( Figure below ).
The rising and falling of ocean tides is another example of a resource in unlimited supply.
A sustainable resource is a resource that is used in a way that meets the needs of the present without keeping future generations from meeting their needs.
People can sustainably harvest wood, cork, and bamboo.
