Where are exoplanets located?
Why are exoplanets interesting to scientists?
What are they looking for?
Describe asteroids and the asteroid belt.
Explain what effects asteroids may have on Earth and other planets.
Is this rock an asteroid?
This rock is somewhat round.
It is called asteroid Vesta, but it may actually be a protoplanet: too round to be an asteroid, not round enough to be a dwarf planet.
This image was taken of Vesta as a spacecraft orbited it for a year.
Scientists are interested in asteroids for many reasons.
They are remnants from the early solar system.
Asteroids sometimes cause mass extinctions.
After the Sun and planets formed, there was some material left over.
These small chunks didn't get close enough to a large body to be pulled in by its gravity.
They now inhabit the solar system as asteroids and comets.
Asteroids ( Figure below ) are very small, irregularly shaped, rocky bodies.
Asteroids orbit the Sun, but they are more like giant rocks than planets.
Since they are small, they have features that are different from planets.
Asteroids do not have enough gravity to become round.
They are too small to have an atmosphere.
