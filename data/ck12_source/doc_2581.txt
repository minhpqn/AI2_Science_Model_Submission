Their electrons can move freely and carry electric current.
You can see in detail how this occurs at the URL below.
Atoms of nonmetals such as the carbon, on the other hand, hold onto their electrons.
Their electrons canâ€™t move freely and carry current.
A few elements, called metalloids, can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals.
Examples include silicon and germanium in group 14.
Both become better conductors at higher temperatures.
These elements are called semiconductors.
Q:
How many valence electrons do atoms of silicon and germanium have?
What happens to their valence electrons when the atoms are exposed to an electric field?
A:
Atoms of these two elements have four valence electrons.
When the atoms are exposed to an electric field, the valence electrons move away from the atoms and allow current to flow.
Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that can participate in interactions with other atoms.
Because valence electrons are so important, atoms may be represented by electron dot diagrams that show only their valence electrons.
The number of valence electrons in atoms may cause them to be unreactive or highly reactive.
For those atoms that are reactive, the number of valence electrons also determines whether they tend to give up or gain electrons in chemical reactions.
Metals, which easily give up electrons, can conduct electricity.
Nonmetals, which attract electrons, generally cannot.
