Halogens have a variety of important uses, such as preventing tooth decay and killing germs.
The Table below gives the melting and boiling points of halogens.
Create a graph with the data, and then describe in words the trends that you see in your graph.

Why is chlorine added to swimming pool water?
Identify the transition metals on the periodic table.
Describe the characteristic electron configuration of the transition elements.
Difference between stock and racing cars
What are the similarities and differences between these two cars?
From the outside, the two cars above look the same (except for the flashy paint job on the racing model).
They are the same model of the car, but one is a stock edition for regular driving while the other one is built for high-speed racing.
We really can’t tell much from the external view.
To see the differences, we need to go under the hood, take the engines apart, and look at the braking and suspension systems in order to see how the two cars differ.
Many electron configurations of elements are simple and straightforward.  We can look at the outer shell and easily understand how that set of elements will react in terms of electron gain or loss.  However, there are sets of elements that are more complex in their behavior.
One such group is called the transition elements .
