Q:
The Figure below shows that a liquid takes the shape of its container.
How could you demonstrate this?
A:
You could put the same volume of liquid in containers with different shapes.
This is illustrated below with a beaker (left) and a graduated cylinder (right).
The shape of the liquid in the beaker is short and wide like the beaker, while the shape of the liquid in the graduated cylinder is tall and narrow like that container, but each container holds the same volume of liquid.

Q:
How could you show that a gas spreads out to take the volume as well as the shape of its container?
A:
You could pump air into a bicycle tire.
The tire would become firm all over as air molecules spread out to take the shape of the tire and also to occupy the entire volume of the tire.
States of matter are different phases in which any given type of matter can exist.
There are four well-known states of matter—solid, liquid, gas, and plasma—but only the first three states are common on Earth.
State of matter is a physical property of matter.
A given kind of matter has the same chemical makeup and the same chemical properties, regardless of state.
Solids have a fixed volume and a fixed shape.
Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container.
Gases take both the volume and the shape of their container.
