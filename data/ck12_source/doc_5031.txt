What are the products of photosynthesis?
How are these products made?
Where does photosynthesis occur?
What happens to the glucose molecules?
Using symbols, write the overall chemical equation for photosynthesis, labeling the reactants, necessary conditions, and products.
Summarize Jan Van Helmont’s willow tree experiment.
State his conclusion and the inference he made after his experiment, and explain how his data supports each.
Finally, relate his findings to what we know today about the overall process of photosynthesis.
Using the overall equation for photosynthesis, explain which components relate to J.B.
Priestley’s observation that “Plants restore the air that animals injure.”
The Chloroplast - Advanced
Describe the structure and function of chloroplasts, thylakoids, and pigments.
Explain how electron carrier molecules form electron transport chains.
What do pancakes and chloroplasts have in common?
The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis.
Part of the photosynthesis reactions occur in an internal membrane within the organelle.
Many of the pigments and other molecules necessary for photosynthesis are embedded within these internal membranes, The chloroplast contains many of these internal membranes, allowing numerous photosynthetic reactions to occur simultaneously, and making photosynthesis very efficient.
These internal membranes stack on top of each other, just like a stack of pancakes.
