Solubility data can be used to calculate the  K_{sp} for a given compound.
The following steps need to be taken.
Convert from solubility to molar solubility.
Use the dissociation equation to determine the concentration of each of the ions in mol/L.
Apply the K_{sp} equation.
Sample Problem:
Calculating  K_{sp} from Solubility
The solubility of lead(II) fluoride is found experimentally to be 0.533 g/L.
Calculate the  K_{sp} for lead(II) fluoride.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem .
solubility of PbF 2 = 0.533 g/L
molar mass = 245.20 g/mol
K_{sp} of PbF 2 = ?
The dissociation equation for PbF 2 and the corresponding  K_{sp} expression
\text{PbF}_2(s) \rightleftarrows \text{Pb}^{2+}(aq)+2\text{F}^-(aq) && K_{sp}=[\text{Pb}^{2+}][\text{F}^-]^2
The steps above will be followed to calculate the  K_{sp} for PbF 2 .
Step 2:
Solve .
