Describe parasitic roundworms.
What is heartworm?
You may have heard that you need to protect your pets from heartworm.
Heartworms are a type of roundworm.
They can be parasites in cats and dogs.
That means, once they infect your pet, they can cause harm.
However, there are preventative treatments available.
The word "worm" is not very scientific.
This informal term describes animals (usually invertebrates) that have long bodies with no arms or legs.
Worms with round, non-segmented bodies are known as nematodes or roundworms ( Figure below ).
They are classified in the phylum Nematoda , which has over 28,000 known species.
Some scientists believe there could be over a million species of Nematodes.
Nematodes are slender bilaterally symmetrical worms, typically less than 2.5 mm long.
The smallest nematodes are microscopic, while free-living species can reach as much as 5 cm, and some parasitic species are larger still, reaching over a meter in length.
The worm body is often covered with ridges, rings, bristles, or other distinctive structures.
The radially symmetrical head of a nematode also has distinct features.
The head is covered with sensory bristles and, in many cases, solid "head-shields" around the mouth region.
The mouth has either three or six lips arranged around the mouth opening, which often have a series of teeth on their inner edges.
Nematodes can be parasites of plants and animals
