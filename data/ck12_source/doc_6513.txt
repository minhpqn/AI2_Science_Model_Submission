A small amount of mass is “left over” and released as energy, as predicted by Einstein’s famous equation E = mc^2 , that relates mass and energy.
This process is known as nuclear fission.
The neutron must be a “slow” neutron, traveling at a speed that is approximately that of the molecules of a gas at the same temperature in the system producing the neutrons.
High-speed (“fast”) neutrons will not result in nuclear fission.
Fission reaction of Uranium-235
Fission of a uranium nucleus produced by collision with a neutron.
The example above illustrates the basic nuclear fission process.
A neutron (generally produced by some controlled process, not usually a natural event) collides with an atom of U-235.
Momentarily, a U-236 atom forms which then splits into two smaller atoms (Kr-93 and Ba-141) in the diagram.
This process results in the release of three new neutrons, which can then initiate fission reactions with more atoms.
We will see later how this propagation of neutrons can be employed in a reactor for the generation of electricity.
An extended version of this process can be seen in the figure below.
Not every collision of a neutron with U-235 results in a fission reaction.
A neutron from the initial fission process may strike an atom of U-238, which does not continue the process.
Another neutron may not collide with a nucleus and is lost in the environment.
However, a third neutron produced from the initial collision can collide with more U-235 and continue the chain reaction to produce more neutrons.

Fission reaction with U-235.
Typical nuclear fission reactions balance in terms of mass.
The total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products:
