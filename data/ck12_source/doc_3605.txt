Interphase of the eukaryotic cell cycle can be subdivided into the following three phases, which are represented in Figure above :
Growth Phase 1 (G1): during this phase, the cell grows rapidly, while performing routine metabolic processes.
It also makes proteins needed for DNA replication and copies some of its organelles in preparation for cell division.
A cell typically spends most of its life in this phase.
This phase is sometimes referred to as Gap 1.
Synthesis Phase (S): during this phase, the cellâ€™s DNA is copied in the process of DNA replication .
Growth Phase 2 (G2): during this phase, the cell makes final preparations to divide.
For example, it makes additional proteins and organelles.
This phase is sometimes referred to as Gap 2.
Control of the Cell Cycle
If the cell cycle occurred without regulation, cells might go from one phase to the next before they were ready.
What controls the cell cycle?
How does the cell know when to grow, synthesize DNA, and divide?
The cell cycle is controlled mainly by regulatory proteins.
These proteins control the cycle by signaling the cell to either start or delay the next phase of the cycle.
They ensure that the cell completes the previous phase before moving on.
Regulatory proteins control the cell cycle at key checkpoints, which are shown in Figure below .
There are a number of main checkpoints.
The G1 checkpoint, just before entry into S phase, makes the key decision of whether the cell should divide.
The S checkpoint determines if the DNA has been replicated properly.
