For example, when rounding 2.344 to three significant figures, round down to 2.34.
If the digit to be rounded is greater than 5, then round up.
For example, when rounding 2.346 to three significant figures, round up to 2.35.
If the digit to be rounded is 5, round up if the digit before 5 is odd, and round down if digit before 5 is even.
For example, when rounding 2.345 to three significant figures, round down to 2.34.
This rule may seem arbitrary, but in a series of many calculations, any rounding errors should cancel each other out.
In any measurement, the number of significant figures is the number of digits thought to be correct by the person doing the measuring.
It includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring device plus one estimated digit.
To determine the number of significant figures in a measurement that someone else has made, follow the rules for counting significant figures.
When measurements are used in a calculation, the answer cannot have more significant figures than the measurement with the fewest significant figures.
Rounding is done when one or more ending digits are dropped to get the correct number of significant figures.
Simple rules state when to round up and when to round down.

How do you determine the number of significant figures when you make a measurement?
Measure the width of a sheet of standard-sized (8.5 in x 11.0 in) loose-leaf notebook paper.
Make the measurement in centimeters and express the answer with the correct number of significant figures.
How many significant figures do each of these measurements have?
In this calculation, how many significant figures should there be in the answer? 1.0234 + 1.1 + 0.0056
Round each of these numbers to three significant figures:
