Here it is shown interacting with DNA.
The Hereditary Material
For almost 100 years, scientists have known plenty about proteins.
They have known that proteins of all different shapes, sizes, and functions exist.
For this reason, many scientists believed that proteins were the heredity material.
It wasnâ€™t until 1928, when Frederick Griffith identified the process of transformation , that individuals started to question this concept.
Griffith demonstrated that transformation occurs, but what was the material that caused the transforming process?
Griffith was studying Streptococcus pneumoniae , a bacterium that infects mammals.
He used two strains of this bacteria, a virulent S (smooth) strain and a harmless R (rough) strain to demonstrate the transfer of genetic material.
The S strain is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, which protects it from the host's immune system, resulting in the death of the host, while the R strain, which does not have the protective capsule, is defeated by the host's immune system.
Hence, when mammalian cells are infected with the R strain bacteria, the host does not die ( Figure below ).
Griffith infected mice with heat-killed S strain bacteria.
As expected, the heat-killed bacteria, as they were dead, had no effect on the mice.
But then he tried a novel experiment.
He mixed the remains of heat-killed S strain bacteria with live R strain bacteria and injected the mixture into mice.
Remember, separately both of these bacteria are harmless to the mice.
And yet the mice died ( Figure below ).
Why?
These mice had both live R and live S strain bacteria in their blood.
How?
