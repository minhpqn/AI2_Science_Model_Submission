However, insects cause humans a lot of harm.
They spread human diseases.
For example, the deadly bubonic plague of the middle ages was spread by fleas.
Today, millions of people die each year from malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes.
Insects also eat our crops.
Sometimes they travel in huge swarms that completely strip the land of all plant material (see Figure below ).
On the other hand, we depend on insects for the very food we eat.
Without insects to pollinate them, flowering plants—including many food crops—could not reproduce.

Locust Swarm.
A swarm of locusts in the African country of Mauritania darkens the mid-day sky.
The hungry insects will eat virtually all the plants in their path.

Better Bees:
Super Bee and Wild Bee
Honeybees are one of the most well-known insects on the planet.
Bees are naturalized on every continent except Antarctica.
Honeybees have a highly developed social structure and depend on their community, or colony, for survival, with a colony containing up to 20,000 bees.
When bees search plants for nectar, pollen sticks to the fuzzy hairs that cover their hind legs.
At the next flower, some of the pollen rubs off and fertilizes that flower.
