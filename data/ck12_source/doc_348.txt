In such a case, a surgeon will piece a broken bone together with metal pins.
Moving the broken pieces together will help keep the bone from moving and give the body a chance to repair the break.
Below, a broken ulna has been repaired with pins ( Figure below ).
Bones can fracture and may sometimes need to be put together with metal pins
The upper part of the ulna, just above the elbow joint, is broken, as you can see in the X-ray to the left.
The x-ray to the right was taken after a surgeon inserted a system of pins and wires across the fracture to bring the two pieces of the ulna into close proximity.
Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage at the ends of the bones breaks down.
The break down of the cartilage leads to pain and stiffness in the joint.
Decreased movement of the joint because of the pain may lead to weakening of the muscles that normally move the joint, and the ligaments surrounding the joint may become loose.
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis .
It has many contributing factors, including aging, sport injuries, fractures, and obesity.
Recall that a ligament is a short band of tough connective tissue that connects bones together to form a joint.
Ligaments can get injured when a joint gets twisted or bends too far.
The protein fibers that make up a ligament can get strained or torn, causing swelling and pain.
Injuries to ligaments are called sprains .
Ankle sprains are a common type of sprain.
Preventing injuries to your bones and ligaments is easier and much less painful than treating an injury.
Wearing the correct safety equipment when performing activities that require such equipment can help prevent many common injuries.
For example, wearing a bicycle helmet can help prevent a skull injury if you fall.
Warming up and cooling down properly can help prevent ligament and muscle injuries.
