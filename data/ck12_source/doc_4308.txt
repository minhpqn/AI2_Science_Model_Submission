These species lack both larval stages and metamorphosis.
Evolution of Arthropods
The oldest known arthropods are trilobites .
A fossil trilobite is shown in Figure below .
Trilobites were marine arthropods.
They had many segments with paired appendages for walking.
As arthropods continued to evolve, segments fused.
Eventually, arthropods with three major segments evolved.
Appendages were also lost or modified during the course of arthropod evolution.
Trilobite Fossil.
This trilobite fossil represents the earliest arthropods.
Trilobites first appeared more than 500 million years ago.
They lived for at least 200 million years before going extinct.
They left behind large numbers of fossils.
Arthropods were the first animals to live on land.
The earliest terrestrial arthropods were probably millipedes.
They moved to land about 430 million years ago.
Early land arthropods evolved adaptations such as book lungs or trachea to breathe air.
The exoskeleton was another important adaptation.
It prevents an animal from drying out.
