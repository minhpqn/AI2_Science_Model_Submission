T = \frac{1}{f}
Plug nâ€™ Chug:
T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{190 \ Hz} = 0.00526 \ s = 5.26 \ ms
Answer: \boxed{\mathbf{5.26 \ ms}}
Question :
The effective k of a diving board is 800\mathrm{N/m} (we say effective because it bends in the direction of motion instead of stretching like a spring, but otherwise behaves the same).
A pudgy diver is bouncing up and down at the end of the diving board.
The y vs. t graph is shown below.
a) What is the distance between the lowest and the highest point of oscillation?
b) What is the Period and frequency of the diver?
c) What is the diver's mass?
d) Write the sinusoidal equation of motion for the diver.
a) As we can see from the graph the highest point is 2m and the lowest point is -2\mathrm{m} .
Therefore the distance is |2\mathrm{m}-(-2\mathrm{m})|=4\mathrm{m}
b)We know that f=\frac{1}{T} From the graph we know that the period is 2 seconds, so the frequency is \frac{1}{2 } hz.
c) To find the diver's mass we will use the equation T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} and solve for m .
Then it is a simple matter to plug in the known values to get the mass.
T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \Rightarrow \frac{T}{2\pi}=\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \Rightarrow (\frac{T}{2\pi})^2=\frac{m}{k} \Rightarrow k(\frac{T}{2\pi})^2=m Now we plug in what we know. m=k(\frac{T}{2\pi})^2=800\frac{N}{m}(\frac{\pi {\mathrm{s}}}{2\pi})^2=200\mathrm{kg}
d) To get the sinusoidal equation we must first choose whether to go with a cosine graph or a sine graph.
Then we must find the amplitude (A), vertical shift (D), horizontal shift (C), and period (B).
