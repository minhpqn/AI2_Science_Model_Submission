Research the pros and cons of this fuel.
Explain how fermentation is used to make bread.
Explain why both alcoholic and lactic acid fermentation must change pyruvic acid, even though no energy is gained in this conversion.
Aerobic vs.
Anaerobic Respiration - Advanced
Compare the energy efficiency of aerobic cellular respiration to that of fermentation.
List the advantages of anaerobic over aerobic respiration.
Explain why vertebrate muscles use both aerobic and anaerobic pathways to make ATP.
Anaerobic vs. aerobic.
Which is more efficient?
It does depend on oxygen.
Why do ALL your cells need oxygen?
Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain of aerobic respiration.
In the absence of oxygen, only a few ATP are produced from glucose.
In the presence of oxygen, many more ATP are made.
Aerobic vs.
Anaerobic Respiration:
A Comparison
As aerobes in a world of aerobic organisms, we tend to consider aerobic respiration “better” than fermentation .
In some ways, it is.
