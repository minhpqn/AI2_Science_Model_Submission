The three primary colors
Many objects have color because they contain pigments.
A pigment is a substance that colors materials by reflecting light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths.
A very common pigment is the dark green pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in plants.
Chlorophyll absorbs all but green wavelengths of visible light.
Pigments are also found in many manufactured products.
They are used to color paints, inks, and dyes.
Just three pigments, called primary pigments, can be combined to produce all other colors.
The primary colors of pigments are the same as the secondary colors of light: cyan, magenta, and yellow.
Q:
A color printer needs just three colors of ink to print all of the colors that we can see.
Which colors are they?
A:
The three colors of ink in a color printer are the three primary pigment colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow.
These three colors can be combined in different ratios to produce all other colors, so they are the only colors needed for full-color printing.
The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the light appears.
Light with the longest wavelength appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength appears violet.
In between are the wavelengths of all the other colors of light.
A prism separates visible light into its different colors.
As light passes through the prism, it slows and bends, but different wavelengths bend at different angles.
