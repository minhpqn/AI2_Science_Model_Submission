You can watch an animation showing how immunization brings about immunity at this link:
Passive immunity results when antibodies are transferred to a person who has never been exposed to the pathogen.
Passive immunity lasts only as long as the antibodies survive in body fluids.
This is usually between a few days and a few months.
Passive immunity may be acquired by a fetus through its mother’s blood.
It may also be acquired by an infant though the mother’s breast milk.
Older children and adults can acquire passive immunity through the injection of antibodies.
