Subsidence due to groundwater depletion
The signs on the pole show where ground level was at different years.
The subsidence is due to groundwater depletion.
The Ogallala Aquifer
One of the biggest aquifers in the world is the Ogallala aquifer.
As you can see below ( Figure below ), this aquifer lies beneath parts of eight U.S. states.
In some places, it is less than a meter deep.
In other places, it is hundreds of meters deep.
The water in the aquifer is mostly from the last ice age.
Map of the Ogallala aquifer
In this map, the area over the Ogallala aquifer is shaded in blue.
The Ogallala aquifer is an important source of freshwater in the American Midwest.
This is a major farming area, and much of the water is used to irrigate crops.
The water in this aquifer is being used up ten times faster than it is recharged.
If this continues, what might happen to the Ogallala aquifer?
When water is pumped from an aquifer, the water table goes down.
Wells must be drilled deeper to get water.
The Ogallala Aquifer was filled in the ice age.
It is heavily used to irrigate Midwestern farms.
The use rate is several times faster than the recharge rate.
