The parts include a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA.
The plasma membrane (also called the cell membrane ) is a thin coat of lipids that surrounds a cell.
It forms the physical boundary between the cell and its environment, so you can think of it as the ‘‘skin’’ of the cell.
Cytoplasm refers to all of the cellular material inside the plasma membrane, other than the nucleus.
Cytoplasm is made up of a watery substance called cytosol , and contains other cell structures such as ribosomes.
Ribosomes are structures in the cytoplasm where proteins are made.
DNA is a nucleic acid found in cells.
It contains the genetic instructions that cells need to make proteins.
These parts are common to all cells, from organisms as different as bacteria and human beings.
How did all known organisms come to have such similar cells?
The similarities show that all life on Earth has a common evolutionary history.

Cells come in many different shapes.
Cells with different functions often have different shapes.
Although cells comes in diverse shapes, all cells have certain parts in common.
