The tubule is lined with spermatogonia , which are diploid, sperm-producing cells.
Surrounding the spermatogonia are other cells.
Some of these other cells secrete substances to nourish sperm, and some secrete testosterone, which is needed for sperm production.

Seminiferous Tubule.
Cross section of a testis and seminiferous tubules.
Spermatogonia lining the seminiferous tubule undergo mitosis to form primary spermatocytes , which are also diploid.
The primary spermatocytes undergo the first meiotic division to form secondary spermatocytes , which are haploid.
Spermatocytes make up the next layer of cells inside the seminiferous tubule.
Finally, the secondary spermatocytes complete meiosis to form spermatids .
Spermatids make up a third layer of cells in the tubule.
After spermatids form, they move into the epididymis to mature into sperm, like the one shown in Figure below .
The spermatids grow a tail and lose excess cytoplasm from the head.
When a sperm is mature, the tail can rotate like a propeller, so the sperm can propel itself forward.
Mitochondria in the connecting piece produce the energy (ATP) needed for movement.
The head of the mature sperm consists mainly of the nucleus, which carries copies of the fatherâ€™s chromosomes.
The part of the head called the acrosome produces enzymes that help the sperm head penetrate an egg.

Mature Sperm Cell.
A mature sperm cell has several structures that help it reach and penetrate an egg.
