This fusion reaction releases a huge amount of energy and takes place in nature only at the extremely high temperatures of stars such as the sun.
Identical Protons, Different Elements
All protons are identical.
For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other elements, or pure substances.
However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons.
In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements.
For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons.
The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus.
The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are neutral in charge.
The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2.

Q:
There are six protons in each atom of carbon.
What is the electrical charge of a carbon nucleus?
A:
The electrical charge of a carbon nucleus is +6.
What Are Protons Made of?
Protons are made of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.
As you can see in the Figure below , a proton contains three quarks (colored circles) and three streams of gluons (wavy white lines).
Two of the quarks are called up quarks (u), and the third quark is called a down quark (d).
