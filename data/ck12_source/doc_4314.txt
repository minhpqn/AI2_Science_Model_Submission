The larva eats and grows and then enters the pupa stage.
The pupa is immobile and may be encased in a cocoon .
During the pupa stage, the insect goes through metamorphosis .
Tissues and appendages of the larva break down and reorganize into the adult form.
How did such an incredible transformation evolve?
Metamorphosis is actually very advantageous.
It allows functions to be divided between life stages.
Each stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stage.
Insects are capable of a surprising range of behaviors.
Most of their behaviors, such as flying and mating, are instinctive.
These are behaviors that donâ€™t need to be learned.
They are largely controlled by genes.
However, some insect behaviors are learned.
For example, ants and bees can learn where food is located and keep going back for more.
Many species of insects have evolved complex social behaviors.
They live together in large, organized colonies (see Figure below ).
This is true of ants, termites, bees, and wasps.
Colonies may include millions of individual insects.
Colony members divide up the labor of the colony.
Different insects are specialized for different jobs.
