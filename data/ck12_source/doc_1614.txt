What is the main role of the plant vacuole?
Describe the structure and properties of a phospholipid and a phospholipid bilayer.
Distinguish between hydrophilic and hydrophobic.
How is a cell membrane like a castle wall?
The walls of a castle, like the cell membrane, are designed to keep out dangerous things.
Whether you're concerned about an enemy army or a disease-causing bacteria, you don't want to allow everything to enter!
However, in order to survive, there are some things that the cell (or the castle) does need to let in.
Introduction to Cell Transport
Cells are found in all different types of environments, and these environments are constantly changing.
For example, one-celled organisms, like bacteria, can be found on your skin, in the ground, or in all different types of water.
Therefore, cells need a way to protect themselves.
This job is done by the cell membrane, which is also known as the plasma membrane.
Controlling the Cell Contents
The cell membrane is semipermeable , or selectively permeable, which means that only some molecules can pass through the membrane.
If the cell membrane were completely permeable, the inside of the cell would be the same as the outside of the cell.
It would be impossible for the cell to maintain homeostasis .
Homeostasis means maintaining a stable internal environment.
For example, if your body cells have a temperature of 98.6Â°F, and it is freezing outside, your cells will maintain homeostasis if the temperature of the cells stays the same and does not drop with the outside temperature.
How does the cell ensure it is semipermeable?
How does the cell control what molecules enter and leave the cell?
