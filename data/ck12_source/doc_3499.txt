What is a cell?
It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit necessary for life.
But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life.
The Cell Biology chapter will discuss some of the fundamental properties of the cell, with lessons that include the cell structure, transport in and out of the cell, energy metabolism, and cell division and reproduction.
Common Parts of the Cell
Describe the importance of the work of Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek.
Summarize the cell theory.
Identify the parts that all are common to all cells.
What's the same between a bacterial cell and one of your cells?
There are many different types of cells, but they all have certain parts in common.
As this image of human blood shows, cells come in different shapes and sizes.
The shapes and sizes directly influence the function of the cell.
Yet, all cells - cells from the smallest bacteria to those in the largest whale - do some similar functions, so they do have parts in common.

Discovery of Cells
The first time the word cell was used to refer to these tiny units of life was in 1665 by a British scientist named Robert Hooke.
Hooke was one of the earliest scientists to study living things under a microscope.
The microscopes of his day were not very strong, but Hooke was still able to make an important discovery.
When he looked at a thin slice of cork under his microscope, he was surprised to see what looked like a honeycomb.
Hooke made the drawing in Figure below to show what he saw.
