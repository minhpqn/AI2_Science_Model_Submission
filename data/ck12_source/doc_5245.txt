The dark “points” on this Siamese cat are caused by a gene that codes for a temperature-sensitive enzyme.
The enzyme, which causes a darkening of the cat’s fur, is active only in the cooler parts of the body such as the tail, feet, ears, and area around the nose.
The pointed pattern is a form of partial albinism, which results from a mutation in an enzyme that is involved in melanin production.
The mutated enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures.
However, it is active in cooler areas of the skin.
This results in dark coloration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, such as the lower limbs and the face, as shown in Figure above .
The cat’s face is cooled by the passage of air through the nose.
Generally adult Siamese cats living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cooler climates.
Height in humans is a complex phenotype influenced by many genes, but it is also influenced by nutrition.
A person who eats a diet poor in nutrients will not grow as tall as they would have had they eaten a more nutritious diet.
Does everyone who smokes develop lung cancer?
No, of course not.
Is it possible to get lung cancer without smoking?
Sadly, yes it is.
That's not to say there is no relationship between the two: smoking is still the leading cause of lung cancer.
But it does suggest that a person's genetic background has a role in this process.
Apart form true single gene disorders, environmental factors, or environmental triggers , may determine the development of disease in individuals genetically predisposed to a particular condition.
Environmental triggers may include stress, physical and mental abuse, diet, exposure to toxins, pathogens, and radiation.
Many cancers are thought to have an environmental component.
It has been suggested that environmental factors play a role in autism as well.
