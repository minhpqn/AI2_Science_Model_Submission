First practical solar car
In 1983, the first drivable solar car was created by Hans Tholstrup, a Danish inventor who was influenced by the earlier Sunmobile.
Called the “Quiet Achiever,” Tholstrup’s car was driven 4000 km across Australia.
However, its average speed was only 23 km/h, despite having more than 700 solar cells on its top panel.
1987:
First World Solar Challenge
Inspired by his success with the Quiet Achiever, in 1987 Tholstrup launched the first World Solar Challenge.
This was the world’s first solar car race.
The race is now held every other year.
In that first race, the winner was General Motors’ “Sunraycer,” shown here.
It had an average speed of 67 km/h.
Its aerodynamic shape helped it achieve that speed.
2008:
First Commercial solar car
In 2008, the first commercial solar car was introduced.
Called the Venturi Astrolab, it has a top speed of 120 km/h.
To go this fast while using very little energy, it is built of ultra-light materials.
Its oversized body protects the driver in case of collision and provides a lot of surface area for solar cells.
Q:
Why was the invention of the solar cell important to the evolution of solar car technology?
