They control how quickly cells use energy and make proteins.
The two parathyroid glands are located behind the thyroid gland.
Parathyroid hormone helps keep the level of calcium in the blood within a narrow range.
It stimulates bone cells to dissolve calcium in bone matrix and release it into the blood.
The pineal gland is a tiny gland located at the base of the brain.
It secretes the hormone melatonin .
This hormone controls sleep-wake cycles and several other processes.
The pancreas is located near the stomach.
Its hormones include insulin and glucagon.
These two hormones work together to control the level of glucose in the blood.
Insulin causes excess blood glucose to be taken up by the liver, which stores the glucose as glycogen.
Glucagon stimulates the liver to break down glycogen into glucose and release it back into the blood.
The pancreas also secretes digestive enzymes into the digestive tract.
The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys.
Each gland has an inner and outer part.
The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body.
The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies.
For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles.
