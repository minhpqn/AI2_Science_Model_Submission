The higher the pH value is, the stronger the base.
The strongest bases, such as drain cleaner, have a pH value close to 14.
Uses of Bases
Bases are used for a variety of purposes.
For example, soaps contain bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH).
Other uses of bases can be seen in the Figure below .
Uses of bases
Bases are ionic compounds that produce negative hydroxide ions (OH-) when dissolved in water.
Bases taste bitter, feel slippery, and conduct electricity when dissolved in water.
Indicator compounds such as litmus can be used to detect bases.
Bases turn red litmus paper blue.
The strength of bases is measured on the pH scale.
A pH value greater than 7 indicates a base, and the higher the number is, the stronger the base.
Bases have many important uses.
For example, they are found in many cleaning products and in concrete.
