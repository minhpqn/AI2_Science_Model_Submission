Section of the nucleus; site of ribosome assembly.
nucleus (plural, nuclei ):
The membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells that contains the genetic material (DNA); control center of the cell.
ribosome :
A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).
The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle, found in most eukaryotic cells, which stores the genetic material (DNA).
The nucleus is surrounded by a double lipid bilayer, the nuclear envelope, which is embedded with nuclear pores.
The nucleolus is inside the nucleus, and is where ribosomes are made.

The Mitochondria - Advanced
Outline the form and function of the mitochondria.
Sperm cells and muscle cells need lots of energy.
What do they have in common?
They have lots of mitochondria.
Mitochondria are called the power plants of the cell, as these organelles are where most of the cell's energy is produced.
Cells that need lots of energy have lots of mitochondria.
