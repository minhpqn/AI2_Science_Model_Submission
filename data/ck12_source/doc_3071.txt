This force causes the object to split apart.
Diagram of a wedge at work
A knife is another example of a wedge.
In the Figure below , a knife is being used to chop tough pecans.
The job is easy to do with the knife because of the wedge shape of the blade.
The very thin edge of the blade easily enters and cuts through the pecans.

Mechanical Advantage of a Wedge
The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine.
It is the ratio of the output force to the input force.
A wedge applies more force to the object (output force) than the user applies to the wedge (input force), so the mechanical advantage of a wedge is greater than 1.
A longer, thinner wedge has a greater mechanical advantage than a shorter, wider wedge.
With all wedges, the trade-off is that the output force is applied over a shorter distance, so force may need to be applied to the wedge repeatedly to push it through the object.
Q :
Which wedge in the Figure below do you think would do the same amount of work with less input force?
Wedges of different shapes
A :
The wedge on the left has a greater mechanical advantage, so it would do the same amount of work with less input force.
A wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes, giving it a thin end and thick end.
