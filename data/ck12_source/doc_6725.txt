Draw a separate FBD for each body.
Set up a sum of forces equation based on the FBD for each body.
Newtonâ€™s Third Law will tell you which forces on different bodies are the same in magnitude.
Your equations should equal your unknown variables at this point.
Question :
Using the diagram below, find the net force on the block.
The block weighs 3\mathrm{kg} and the inclined plane has a coefficient of friction of .6 .
The first step to solving a Newton's Laws problem is to identify the object in question.
In our case, the block on the slope is the object of interest.
Next, we need to draw a free-body diagram.
To do this, we need to identify all of the forces acting on the block and their direction.
The forces are friction, which acts in the negative x direction, the normal force, which acts in the positive y direction, and gravity, which acts in a combination of the negative y direction and the positive x direction.
Notice that we have rotated the picture so that the majority of the forces acting on the block are along the y or x axis.
This does not change the answer to the problem because the direction of the forces is still the same relative to each other.
When we have determined our answer, we can simply rotate it back to the original position.
Now we need to break down gravity (the only force not along one of the axises) into its component vectors (which do follow the axises). \mathrm{The~x~component~of~gravity:}~9.8\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\times cos{60}=4.9\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\\\\mathrm{The~y~component~of~gravity:}~9.8\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\times sin{60}=8.5\mathrm{m/{s^2}} Yet these are only the acceleration of gravity so we need to multiply them by the weight of the block to get the force.
F=ma=3\mathrm{kg}\times 4.9\mathrm{m/{s^2}}=14.7\mathrm{N}F=ma=3\mathrm{kg}\times 8.5\mathrm{m/{s^2}}=25.5\mathrm{N}
Now that we have solved for the force of the y-component of gravity we know the normal force (they are equal).
Therefore the normal force is 25.5 \mathrm{N} .
Now that we have the normal force and the coefficient of static friction, we can find the force of friction.
