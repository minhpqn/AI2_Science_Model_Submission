What causes an earthquake?
What is a creepmeter?
How much movement does the creepmeter in the video sense?
How many earthquakes occur at the San Andreas fault each year?
Why are earthquakes at transform plate boundaries always shallow focus?
Why are there so many small faults in the San Francisco Bay Area?
Why do such large earthquakes take place along the San Andreas Fault?
Earthquakes at Convergent Plate Boundaries
Describe earthquakes that take place at convergent plate boundaries.
What damage is done to people's lives by earthquakes?
In a large earthquake hundreds or thousands of people may die.
Many more may lose their homes and livelihoods.
After a large quake, the world's attention turns to help the victims.
But soon there is another disaster in the news, and the world's attention turns.
People may be left homeless due to an earthquake for many years.
Convergent Plate Boundaries
Earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries mark the location of the subducting lithosphere.
The motion of the lithosphere as it plunges through the mantle causes the quakes ( Figure below ).
At greater depths, the plate heats up enough to deform plastically.
