Loudest sounds among insects; have special muscles to produce sounds.
Predation:
Produced mostly by moths to warn bats.
Wide range of insects have evolved chemical communication; chemicals are used to attract, repel, or provide other kinds of information; use of scents is especially well developed in social insects.
Antennae of males ( Figure below ) can detect pheromones (chemicals released by animals that influence the behavior of others within the same species) of female moths over distances of many miles.
Honey bees are the only invertebrates to have evolved this type of communication; length of dance represents distance to be flown.

Insects are Social
Social insects, such as termites, ants, and many bees and wasps ( Figure below ), are the most familiar social species.
They live together in large, well-organized colonies.
Only those insects which live in nests or colonies can home.
Homing means that an insect can return to a single hole among many other apparently identical holes, even after a long trip or after a long time.
A few insects migrate in groups.
For example, the monarch butterfly flies between Mexico and North America each spring and fall ( Figure below ).

Two Major Groups of Insects
Insects are divided into two major groups:
