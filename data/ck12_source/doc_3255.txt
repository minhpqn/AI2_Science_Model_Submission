A third type of luminescence is called bioluminescence.
This is the production of light by living things as a result of chemical reactions.
The jellyfish in the opening photo above produces light by bioluminescence.
So does the firefly in the Figure below .
Fireflies give off visible light to attract mates.

Many other objects appear to produce their own light, but they actually just reflect light from another source.
Being lit by another source is called illumination .
The moon in the Figure below is glowing so brightly that you can see shadows under the trees.
It appears to glow from its own light, but it’s really just illuminated by light from the sun.
Everything you can see that doesn’t produce its own light is illuminated by light from some other source.

Visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human eye can detect.
Humans and virtually all other organisms depend on visible light to survive.
Humans and many other animals use it to see.
Plants use it to make food for themselves and most other organisms.
Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun.
The sun produces light because it is so hot.
Glowing with visible light because of a high temperature is called incandescence.
Producing light without a high temperature is called luminescence.
