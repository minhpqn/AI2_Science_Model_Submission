You’ve probably known about gravity since you were in elementary school.
It’s the force that pulls all objects on Earth down toward the ground.
Is that all there is to gravity?
Absolutely not!
It Started with Newton
In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton introduced his law of gravity, which identifies gravity as a force of attraction between all objects with mass in the universe.
The law also states that the strength of gravity between two objects depends on their mass and distance apart.
Newton’s law of gravity was accepted for more than two centuries.
It can predict the motion of most objects and was even used by NASA to land astronauts on the moon.
It’s still used for most practical purposes.
However, Newton’s law doesn’t explain why gravity occurs.
It only describes how gravity seems to affect objects.
There are also some cases in which Newton’s law doesn’t even describe what happens.
Q :
Newton expressed his ideas about gravity as a law.
A law in science is a description of what always occurs in nature.
For example, according to Newton’s law, objects on Earth always fall down, not up.
What is needed to explain gravity?
A :
A theory is needed to explain gravity.
