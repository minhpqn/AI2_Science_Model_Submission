Maturation of the ovum.
Notice only one mature ovum, or egg, forms during meiosis from the primary oocyte.
Three polar bodies may form during oogenesis.
These polar bodies will not form mature gametes.
Conversely, four haploid spermatids form during meiosis from the primary spermatocyte.
Meiosis is a step during spermatogenesis and oogenesis.
Spermatogenesis produces four haploid sperm cells, while oogenesis produces one mature ovum.
