Identify examples of polygenic traits in humans.
Green, blue, brown, black, hazel, violet, or grey.
What color are your eyes?
Of course human eyes do not come in multi-color, but they do come in many colors.
How do eyes come in so many colors?
Are there more than two alleles?
Is there more than one gene?
That brings us to complex inheritance patterns, known as non-Mendelian inheritance.
Many times inheritance is more complicated than the simple patterns observed by Mendel.
Non-Mendelian Modes of Inheritance
The relationship between genotype and phenotype is rarely as simple as the examples Mendel studied.
Each characteristic he studied had two alleles, one of which was completely dominant and the other completely recessive, resulting in only two phenotypes.
Geneticists now know that alleles can be codominant, or incompletely dominant, and that there are usually more than two alleles for a gene in a population.
Complicating issues further, some phenotypes are controlled by more than one gene.
What happens when there are two alleles in a heterozygote and neither allele is completely dominant nor completely recessive?
Can both traits appear in the phenotype?
Essentially, yes they can.
Can there be two dominant alleles for the same gene?
Codominance occurs when both traits appear in a heterozygous offspring.
For example, roan shorthorn cattle have codominant genes for hair color.
