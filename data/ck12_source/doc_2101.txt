The energy travels to Earth mostly as visible light.
The energy is carried through the empty space by radiation .
We can use sunlight as an energy resource, called solar energy.
Solar Energy as a Resource
Solar energy has been used on a small scale for hundreds of years.
Today we are using solar energy for more of our power demands.
Solar power plants are being built in many locations around the world.
In the United States, the southwestern deserts are well suited for solar plants.
Solar Power Plants
Sunlight is turned into electricity at a solar power plant.
A large group of mirrors focuses sunlight on one place.
This place is called a receiver ( Figure below ).
At the receiver, a liquid such as oil or water is heated to a high temperature.
The liquid transfers its heat by conduction .
In conduction, energy moves between two objects that are in contact.
The warmer object transfers heat to the cooler object.
At a solar power plant, the energy conducted by the heated liquid is used to make electricity.
A solar power tower is used to concentrate the solar energy collected by many solar panels
