Pulling Down and Pushing Up
One force acting on you—and all the other objects on Earth—is gravity.
Look at the physics book in the Figure below .
Gravity pulls the book downward with a force of 20 Newtons.
Why doesn’t the book fall to the ground?
The table pushes upward on the book with the same amount of force.
The combined force, or net force , acting on the book is 0 Newtons.
That’s because upward and downward forces are balanced, so they cancel out.

This physics book is at rest because it has balanced forces
Forces Acting in Opposite Directions
In general, whenever forces act on an object in opposite directions—like the book on the table—the net force is equal to the difference between the two forces.
In other words, one force is subtracted from the other to calculate the net force.
If the opposing forces are equal, or balanced, the net force is zero, as it is for the book.
That’s why the book doesn’t fall to the ground but instead remains resting on the table.
However, if the opposing forces are unbalanced, the net force is greater than zero, although it will be less than either of the individual forces.
In this case, the object will move in the same direction as the net force.
Look at the dogs playing tug-of-war in the Figure below .
The dogs are pulling the rope in opposite directions, but one dog is pulling with more force than the other.
The net force acting on the rope is 2 Newtons to the right, so the rope will move to the right.
