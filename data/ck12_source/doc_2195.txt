What is the likely origin of the two moons orbiting Mars?
Describe the characteristics of Jupiter.
What are Jupiter's most distinctive features?
Jupiter has been well studied for being so far away.
Many flybys, one orbiter, and a probe have all visited the planet.
While the possibility exists for humans to reach Mars, a manned trip to Jupiter seems a long ways away.
The round trip would take at least 10 years.
Who would want to spend more than a decade on a spaceship?
At least they could see the Great Red Spot and other features in person!
Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.
Jupiter is named for the king of the gods in Roman mythology.
The Romans named the largest planet for their most important god.
They followed the tradition of the Greeks, who had similarly named the planet Zeus.
The Romans built a temple to Jupiter on the hill.
Jupiter is truly a giant!
The planet has 318 times the mass of Earth, and over 1,300 times Earthâ€™s volume.
So Jupiter is much less dense than Earth.
Because Jupiter is so large, it reflects a lot of sunlight.
