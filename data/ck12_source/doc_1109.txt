Craft designed for human spaceflight, like the Apollo missions, were very successful.
They were also very expensive and could not carry much cargo.
They could be used only once.
To outfit the ISS, NASA needed a space vehicle that was reusable.
It needed to be able to carry large pieces of equipment.
The cargo might include satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station.
The resulting spacecraft is called a space shuttle ( Figure below ).

Since 1981, the space shuttle has been the United States’ primary vehicle for carrying people and large equipment into space.
A space shuttle has three main parts.
The part you are probably most familiar with is the orbiter .
The orbiter has wings like an airplane.
When a space shuttle launches, the orbiter is attached to a huge fuel tank that contains liquid fuel.
On the sides of the fuel tank are two large "booster rockets." All of this is needed to get the orbiter out of Earth’s atmosphere.
Once in space, the orbiter can be used to release equipment (such as a satellite or supplies for the International Space Station).
It can be used to repair existing equipment, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronauts can even do experiments directly on board the orbiter.
When the mission is complete, the orbiter re-enters Earth’s atmosphere.
The craft flies back to Earth more like a glider than an airplane.
