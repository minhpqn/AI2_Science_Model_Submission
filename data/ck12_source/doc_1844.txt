In this animation, notice how the wave refracts as it comes into the beach.
Most waves strike the shore at an angle.
This creates longshore currents, which are described in the concept "Surface Ocean Currents."
Ocean waves have a tremendous amount of energy and so they may do a great deal of erosion.
Some landforms created by erosion are platforms, arches, and sea stacks.
Longshore currents are created because water approaches the shore at an angle.
