It increases the chances that fertilization will take place.
It also means that many embryos will form at once, which helps ensure that at least some of them will be able to escape predators.
With spawning, there is no way for fish parents to know which embryos are their own.
Therefore, fish generally don’t provide any care to their eggs or offspring.
There are some exceptions, however, including the fish described in Figure below , which is performing mouth brooding .

Mouth Brooding.
Some species of fish carry their fertilized eggs in their mouth until they hatch.
This is called mouth brooding.
If you look closely, you can see the eggs inside the mouth of the cardinalfish pictured here.
Fish eggs hatch into larvae that are different from the adult form of the species (see Figure below ).
A larva swims attached to a large yolk sac, which provides the larva with food.
The larva eventually goes through metamorphosis and changes into the adult form.
However, it still needs to mature before it can reproduce.
Salmon Larva.
This newly hatched salmon larva doesn’t look very fish-like.
The structure hanging from the larva is the yolk sac.
Nearly all fish reproduce sexually and have separate sexes.
Fertilization is generally external, and most fish are oviparous.
Many adults of the same species may come together in a group and release gametes into the water at the same time, which is called spawning.
