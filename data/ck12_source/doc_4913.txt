Flattened membranous regions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.
endomembrane system :
Divide the cell into functional and structural compartments (organelles); composed of the different membranes that are suspended in the cytoplasm within a eukaryotic cell; includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vacuoles, vesicles, peroxisomes and the cell membrane.
Golgi apparatus :
A large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae; modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell.
trans-Golgi network (TGN) :
A major sorting pathway that directs newly synthesized proteins to different subcellular destinations.
The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae.
The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell.
Describe the structure and role of the Golgi apparatus.

Vesicles and Vacuoles - Advanced
Outline the form and function of organelles.
What's a little ball of plasma membrane?
A vesicle.
Because vesicles are made of phospholipids, they can break off of and fuse with other membraneous material.
This allows them to serve as small transport containers, moving substances around the cell and to the cell membrane.
A vesicle is a small, spherical compartment that is separated from the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer.
Many vesicles are made in the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, or are made from parts of the cell membrane by endocytosis.
Vesicles can also fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents to the outside.
