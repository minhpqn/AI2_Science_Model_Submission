Cell Cycle Summary
A resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing.
1 st growth phase
2 nd growth phase
Cells increase in size in G 1 .
Cells perform their normal activities.
DNA replication occurs during this phase.
The cell will continue to grow and many organelles will divide during their phase.
Cell growth stops at this stage.
Mitosis divides the nucleus into two nuclei, followed by cytokinesis which divides the cytoplasm.
Two genetically identical daughter cells result.
cell cycle :
A repeating series of events, during which the eukaryotic cell carries out its necessary functions, including metabolism, cellular growth, DNA replication and cell division, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.
cellular senescence :
The phenomenon by which normal diploid cells lose the ability to divide.
cytokinesis :
Division of the cytoplasm, forming two daughter cells.
interphase :
