When two plates of continental crust collide, the material pushes upward.
This forms a high mountain range.
The remnants of subducted oceanic crust remain beneath the continental convergence zone.
Continent-continent convergence creates some of the worldâ€™s largest mountains ranges.
The Himalayas ( Figure below ) are the world's tallest mountains.
They are forming as two continents collide.
The Appalachian Mountains are the remnants of a larger mountain range.
This range formed from continent-continent collisions in the time of Pangaea.
K2 is a mountain in the Himalaya Mountains
The Karakoram Range is part of the Himalaya Mountains.
K2, pictured here, is over 20,000 feet high.
The number of mountains this tall in the Himalayas is impressive.
Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct.
When two continental plates converge, they smash together and create mountains.
The amazing Himalaya Mountains are the result of this type of convergent plate boundary.
The Appalachian Mountains resulted from ancient convergence when Pangaea came together.
