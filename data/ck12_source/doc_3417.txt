Introduction to Biology
Is there a way to define life ?
Scientifically, there is an actual definition of life.
Living organisms must have certain characteristics.
If they do not have these characteristics, are they living?
This butterfly, like all other insects, animals, plants, and every other living organism, shares common characteristics with all life.
What exactly does it mean to be alive ?
The Introduction to Biology chapter will answer this question.
These lessons will serve as an introduction to biology, discussing basic Fundamental Concepts of Science and the Chemistry of Life.
Define the scientific method.
Explain the steps of the scientific method.
Describe how scientists study the natural world.
Develop a study incorporating the steps of the scientific method.
Chances are you've heard of the scientific method.
But what exactly is the scientific method?
Is it a precise and exact way that all science must be done?
Or is it a series of steps that most scientists generally follow, but may be modified for the benefit of an individual investigation?
