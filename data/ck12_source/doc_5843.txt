Anions are negative ions that are formed when a nonmetal atom gains one or more electrons.
Anions are so named because they are attracted to the anode (positive field) in an electric field.  Atoms typically gain electrons so that they will have the electron configuration of a noble gas.
All the elements in Group 17 have seven valence electrons due to the outer ns 2 np 5 configuration.
Therefore, each of these elements would gain one electron and become an anion with a 1− charge.
Likewise, Group 16 elements form ions with a 2− charge, and the Group 15 nonmetals form ions with a 3− charge.
Pauling electronegativity values of the periodic table
Naming anions is slightly different than naming cations.
The ending of the element’s name is dropped and replaced with the – ide suffix.
For example, F - is the fluoride ion, while O 2- is the oxide ion.  As is the case with cations, the charge on the anion is indicated by a superscript following the symbol.
Common anions are listed in the Table below :

Uses for Anions
Fluoride ion is widely used in water supplies to help prevent tooth decay.
Chloride is an important component in ion balance in blood.
Iodide ion is needed by the thyroid gland to make the hormone thyroxine.
Anions are formed by the addition of one or more electrons to the outer shell of an atom.
Group 17 elements add one electron to the outer shell, group 16 elements add two electrons, and group 15 elements add three electrons.
Anions are named by dropping the ending of the element’s name and adding - ide.
