What does this chameleon have in common with a snake?
Though they are both reptiles and seem very different, chameleons and snakes actually share several traits.
For example, they both have skin covered in scales and are cold-blooded animals.
But notice the distinct eyes and "horns" on the chameleon.
Snakes don't have these.
And some chameleons have the ability to change color.
Characteristics of Reptiles
What reptiles can you name?
Snakes, alligators, and crocodiles are all reptiles.
Modern reptiles live on every continent except Antarctica.
They range in size from the newly-discovered Jaragua Sphaero (a dwarf gecko), at 0.6 inches, to the saltwater crocodile, at up to 23 feet.
There are four living orders of reptiles:
Squamata, which includes lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenids (or “worm-lizards”).
Crocodilia, which includes crocodiles, gharials ( Figure below ), caimans, and alligators.
Testudines, which includes turtles and tortoises.
Sphenodontia, which includes tuatara ( Figure below ).
