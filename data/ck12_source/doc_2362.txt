Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication.
If research results can be replicated, it means they are more likely to be correct.
Replication is important in science so scientists can “check their work.” The result of an investigation is not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeated many times and the same result is always obtained.
Scientists often repeat their own experiments to see if they can replicate the result.
These repeated experiments are called trials.
At the following URL, read about the repeated trials in an investigation involving crows.
Be sure to watch the movies showing the crows during different trials.
After reading the article and seeing the movies, answer the questions below.
Why were repeated trials done in this experiment?
Why might other researchers in other labs try to replicate the results?
What is replication?
Why is replication important in science?
Scientists do not try to replicate every investigation, but some are repeated many times.
For example, many researchers tried to replicate the vaccine-autism study described above.
Why do you think so much effort was made to replicate this particular study?
What was the outcome of the additional research?
