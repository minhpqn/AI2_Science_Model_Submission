Define combination reaction.
Write products of combination reactions when given the reactants.
A wheel contains a wheel rim and a tire, which is an example of a combination reaction
How useful is a wheel rim?
A wheel rim is not very useful by itself.
Driving on the rim can damage it and make for a very rough ride.
When the rim is combined with a tire, the product can be put on a car and used for a safe and comfortable ride.
The two separate items have combined to make something that improves the car ride.
A combination reaction is a reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a single new substance.
Combination reactions can also be called synthesis reactions.
The general form of a combination reaction is:
A+B \rightarrow AB
One combination reaction is two elements combining to form a compound.
Solid sodium metal reacts with chlorine gas to produce solid sodium chloride.
2\text{Na}(s)+\text{Cl}_2 (g) \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl}(s)
