Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light.
Infrared light is light with the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies.
You canâ€™t see infrared light, but you can feel it as heat.
Besides the sun, flames and living things give off infrared light.
Visible light consists of a very narrow range of wavelengths that falls between infrared light and ultraviolet light.
It is the only light that people can see.
Different wavelengths of visible light appear as different colors.
Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than visible light.
Ultraviolet light also has more energy, which makes it useful for killing germs.
Too much exposure to ultraviolet light can damage the skin.
