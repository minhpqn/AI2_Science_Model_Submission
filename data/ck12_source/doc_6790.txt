Consider the torque on the plank caused by weight A .
What force, precisely, is responsible for this torque?
What is the magnitude (value) of this force, in Newtons?
What is the moment arm of the torque produced by weight A ?
What is the magnitude of this torque, in N \cdot m ?
Repeat parts (a – d) for weights B and C .
Calculate the net torque.
Is the plank balanced?
Explain.
There is a uniform rod of mass 2.0 \;\mathrm{kg} of length 2.0 \;\mathrm{m} .
It has a mass of 2.6 \;\mathrm{kg} at one end.
It is attached to the ceiling .40 \;\mathrm{m} from the end with the mass.
The string comes in at a 53 degree angle to the rod.
Calculate the total torque on the rod.
Determine its direction of rotation.
Explain, but don’t calculate, what happens to the angular acceleration as it rotates toward a vertical position.
At End.
Discuss in class.
Moment of inertia at the end 1/3 \;\mathrm{ML}^2 at the center 1/12 \;\mathrm{ML}^2 and torque, \tau = I\alpha change the in the same way
a. weight b. 19.6 \;\mathrm{N} c. plank’s length (0.8\mathrm{m}) left of the pivot d. 15.7 \;\mathrm{N \ m} , e.
