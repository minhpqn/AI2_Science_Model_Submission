Explain nesting and incubation in birds.
Compare hatchlings between ground-nesting birds and those that nest off the ground.
Is this pair of birds actually a “couple”?
Yes.
Birds do actually pair up each mating season, if not for life.
And the male better be prepared to treat his female properly.
There is actually an elaborate process in which the female chooses her mate.
Reproduction in birds may be quite complicated and lengthy.
Birds reproduce sexually and have separate sexes and internal fertilization, so males and females must mate for fertilization to occur.
Mating is generally preceded by courtship.
In most species, parents also take care of their eggs and hatchlings.
Courtship and Mating
Courtship is behavior that is intended to attract a mate.
It may involve singing specific courtship songs or putting on some type of visual display.
For example, a bird may spread out and display its tail feathers or do a ritualized mating “dance.” Typically, males perform the courtship behavior, and females choose a mate from among competing males.
During mating, a male bird presses his cloaca against his mate’s cloaca and passes sperm from his cloaca to hers.
After fertilization, eggs pass out of the female’s body, exiting through the opening in the cloaca.
Nesting and Incubation
Eggs are usually laid in a nest.
The nest may be little more than a small depression in the ground, or it may be very elaborate, like the weaver bird nest in Figure below .
