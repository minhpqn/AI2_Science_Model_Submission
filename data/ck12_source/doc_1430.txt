The source might be a spring, where water flows out of the ground.
Or the source might be water from melting snow on a mountain top, like the stream pictured below ( Figure below ).
A single stream may have multiple sources.
Rapid stream in Glacier National Park
A stream flows fast and steep where it originates in the mountains.
This stream, in Glacier National Park in Montana, is coming from snow melt.
Diagram of the features of a river
Water in a stream flows along the ground from higher to lower elevation.
What force causes the water to keep flowing?
A stream or river probably ends when it flows into a body of water, such as a lake or an ocean.
A stream ends at its mouth .
As the water flows into the body of water, it slows down and drops the sediment it was carrying.
The sediment may build up to form a delta.
Several other features of streams and rivers are also shown above ( Figure above ).
Small streams often flow into bigger streams or rivers.
The small streams are called tributaries .
A river and all its tributaries make up a river system.
At certain times of year, a stream or river may overflow its banks.
The area of land that is flooded is called the floodplain .
The floodplain may be very wide where the river flows over a nearly flat surface.
