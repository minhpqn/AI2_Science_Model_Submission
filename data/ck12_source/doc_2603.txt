What Are Noble Gases?
Noble gases are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the periodic table.
As you can see in the periodic table in Figure below , noble gases include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn).
All noble gases are colorless and odorless.
They also have low boiling points, explaining why they are gases at room temperature.
Radon, at the bottom of the group, is radioactive, so it constantly decays to other elements.

The periodic table
Q:
Based on their position in the periodic table ( Figure above ), how many valence electrons do you think noble gases have?
A:
The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group It then increases by one from left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18.
Therefore, noble gases have eight valence electrons.
Chemical Properties of Noble Gases
Noble gases are the least reactive of all known elements.
That’s because with eight valence electrons, their outer energy levels are full.
