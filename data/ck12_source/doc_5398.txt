Are all mutations bad?
No.
Obviously large chromosomal changes are going to have a significant effect.
But what about single base changes?
Many single base mutations most likely have no effect, unless they change the reading frame.
The effects of any one mutations can vary from having no effect to having lethal consequences.
Imagine the coding sequence (broken up into codons) TAC CCC GGG.
This is a fairly generic coding sequence, and probably occurs many times in the human genome.
It transcribes into the following mRNA:
AUG GGG CCC, which would translate into start-glycine-proline.
As glycine is encoded by four codons (GGG, GGA, GGC, GGU), any change in the third position of that codon will have no effect.
The same is true for the codon for proline.
If a mutation does not change the amino acid sequence in a protein, the mutation will have no effect.
In fact, the overwhelming majority of mutations have no significant effect, since DNA repair mechanisms are able to mend most of the changes before they become permanent.
Furthermore, many organisms have mechanisms for eliminating otherwise permanently mutated somatic cells.
But what about changes in the other nucleotides in the sequence?
They could have potentially dramatic effects.
The effects depend on the outcome of the mutation.
Obviously any change to the start codon will interrupt the start of translation.
Turning the simple glycine into the nonpolar (and relatively large) tryptophan (UGG codon) could have dramatic effects on the function of the protein.
