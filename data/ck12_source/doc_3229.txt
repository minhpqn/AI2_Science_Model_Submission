Then create a timeline of ideas and discoveries about the nature of light.
Why did scientists debate the nature of electromagnetic radiation for more than 200 years?
State Einsteinâ€™s wave-particle theory of electromagnetic radiation.
What is a photon?
After Einstein proposed his wave-particle theory, how did double-slit experiments provide evidence to support the theory?
Properties of Electromagnetic Waves
State the speed of light.
Describe wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic waves.
Relate wave frequency to wave energy.
Show how to calculate wavelength or wave frequency if the other value is known.
What do these two photos have in common?
They both represent electromagnetic waves.
These are waves that consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields.
They transmit energy through matter or across space.
Some electromagnetic waves are generally harmless.
The light we use to see is a good example.
Other electromagnetic waves can be very harmful and care must be taken to avoid too much exposure to them.
X rays are a familiar example.
Why do electromagnetic waves vary in these ways?
It depends on their properties.
