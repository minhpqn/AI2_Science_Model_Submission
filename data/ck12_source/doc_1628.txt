Name the reactants and products of photosynthesis.
Summarize the process of photosynthesis.
Are plants the only organisms that perform photosynthesis?
Although we generally discuss plants when learning about photosynthesis, keep in mind that plants are not the only organisms that can make their own food.
Some bacteria and some protists, such as the algae pictured here, also perform photosynthesis.
This alga has chloroplasts and photosynthesizes just like a plant.
The Process of Photosynthesis
In the Presence of Sunlight, Carbon Dioxide + Water â†’ Glucose + Oxygen
Photosynthesis takes place in the organelle of the plant cell known as the chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts are one of the main differences between plant and animal cells.
Animal cells do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot photosynthesize.
Photosynthesis occurs in two stages.
During the first stage, the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the chloroplast.
Water is used, and oxygen is produced during this part of the process.
During the second stage, carbon dioxide is used, and glucose is produced.
Chloroplasts contain stacks of thylakoids , which are flattened sacs of membrane.
Energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane.
There are two separate parts of a chloroplast: the space inside the chloroplast itself, and the space inside the thylakoids ( Figure below ).
The inner compartments inside the thylakoids are called the thylakoid space (or lumen).
This is the site of the first part of photosynthesis.
