Types of Oil
Oil comes out of the ground as crude oil .
Crude oil is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons.
Oil is separated into different compounds at an oil refinery.
This is done by heating the oil.
Each hydrocarbon compound in crude oil boils at a different temperature.
We get gasoline, diesel, and heating oil, plus waxes, plastics, and fertilizers from crude oil.
These fuels are rich sources of energy.
Since they are mostly liquids they can be easily transported.
These fuels provide about 90% of the energy used for transportation around the world.
Gasoline is a concentrated resource.
It contains a large amount of energy for its weight.
This is important because the more something weighs, the more energy is needed to move it.
If gasoline could only provide a little energy, a car would have to carry a lot of it to be able to travel very far.
Or the car would need to be filled up frequently.
So a highly concentrated energy resource is a practical fuel to power cars and other forms of transportation.
Let's consider how gasoline powers a car.
As gasoline burns, it releases most of its energy as heat.
It also releases carbon dioxide gas and water vapor.
The heat makes the gases expand.
