Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar.
The clock was still ticking, but the ticking sound could no longer be heard.
That’s because the sound couldn’t travel away from the clock without air particles to pass the sound energy along.

Sound Waves and Matter
Most of the sounds we hear reach our ears through the air, but sounds can also travel through liquids and solids.
If you swim underwater—or even submerge your ears in bathwater—any sounds you hear have traveled to your ears through the water.
Some solids, including glass and metals, are very good at transmitting sounds.
Foam rubber and heavy fabrics, on the other hand, tend to muffle sounds.
They absorb rather than pass on the sound energy.
Q:
How can you tell that sounds travel through solids?
A:
One way is that you can hear loud outdoor sounds such as sirens through closed windows and doors.
You can also hear sounds through the inside walls of a house.
For example, if you put your ear against a wall, you may be able to eavesdrop on a conversation in the next room—not that you would, of course.
In science, sound is defined as the transfer of energy from a vibrating object in waves that travel through matter.
All sound waves begin with vibrating matter.
The vibrations generate longitudinal waves that travel through matter in all directions.
