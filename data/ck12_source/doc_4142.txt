People often introduce plants to new habitats where they lack natural predators and parasites.
The introduced plants may spread rapidly and drive out native plants.
Many plants produce pollen , which can cause allergies.
Plants may also produce toxins that harm human health (see Figure below ).

Poison ivy causes allergic skin rashes.
It’s easy to recognize the plant by its arrangement of leaves in groups of three.
That’s the origin of the old saying, “leaves of three, leave it be.”
