It starts with an obstacle, such as a rock.
The obstacle causes the wind to slow down.
The wind then drops some of its sand.
As more sand is deposited, the dune gets bigger.
The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind.
This causes more sand to drop.
The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune ( Figure below ).
How a sand dune forms
A sand dune has a gentle slope on the side the wind blows from.
The opposite side has a steep slope.
This side is called the slip face.
Migration of Sand Dunes
Once a sand dune forms, it may slowly migrate over the land.
The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune.
This is done by saltation.
When the sand grains reach the top of the dune, they slip down the steeper side.
The grains are pulled by gravity.
The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground.
A dune moves in the same direction that the wind usually blows.
Can you explain why?
