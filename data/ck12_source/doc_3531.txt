Proteins found in the tonoplast control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole.
The central vacuole also stores the pigments that color flowers.
The central vacuole contains large amounts of a liquid called cell sap, which differs in composition to the cell cytosol.
Cell sap is a mixture of water, enzymes, ions, salts, and other substances.
Cell sap may also contain toxic byproducts that have been removed from the cytosol.
Toxins in the vacuole may help to protect some plants from being eaten.
Plant plastids are a group of closely related membrane-bound organelles that carry out many functions.
They are responsible for photosynthesis, for storage of products such as starch, and for the synthesis of many types of molecules that are needed as cellular building blocks.
Plastids have the ability to change their function between these and other forms.
Plastids contain their own DNA and some ribosomes, and scientists think that plastids are descended from photosynthetic bacteria that allowed the first eukaryotes to make oxygen.
The main types of plastids and their functions are:
Chloroplasts are the organelle of photosynthesis.
They capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to make food (sugar) for the plant.
The arrangement of chloroplasts in a plantâ€™s cells can be seen in Figure below .
Chromoplasts make and store pigments that give petals and fruit their orange and yellow colors.
Leucoplasts do not contain pigments and are located in roots and non-photosynthetic tissues of plants.
They may become specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid, or protein.
However, in many cells, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function.
Instead, they make molecules such as fatty acids and many amino acids.
