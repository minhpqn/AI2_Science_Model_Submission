Next, assume exactly 1 mol of ammonia  (n = 1) and calculate the volume that such an amount would occupy at the given temperature and pressure.
V = \frac{ nRT}{P}=\frac{1.00 \ \text{mol} \times 0.08206 \text{ L} \cdot \text{atm/K}\cdot \text{mol} \times 293 \text{ K}}{0.913 \ \text{atm}}=26.3 \text{ L}
Now the density can be calculated by dividing the mass of one mole of ammonia by the volume above.
\text{density}=\frac{17.04 \text{ g}}{26.3 \text{ L}}=0.647 \ \text{g/L}
As a point of comparison, this density is slightly less than the density of ammonia at STP, which is equal to \frac{(17.04 \ \text{g/mol})}{(22.4 \ \text{L/mol})} = 0.761\ \text{g/L} .
It makes sense that the density should be lower compared to that at STP since both the increase in temperature (from 0°C to 20°C) and the decrease in pressure (from 1 atm to 0.913 atm) would cause the NH 3 molecules to spread out a bit further from one another.

Knowing the amount of a gas needed is important for many applications
How is fertilizer produced?
The Haber cycle reaction of gaseous nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia is a critical step in the production of fertilizer from ammonia.
It is important to have an excess of the starting materials so that a maximum yield of ammonia can be achieved.
By knowing how much ammonia is needed for manufacture of a batch of fertilizer, the proper amounts of nitrogen and hydrogen gases can be incorporated into the process.
You have learned how to use molar volume to solve stoichiometry problems for chemical reactions involving one or more gases at STP.
Now, we can use the ideal gas law to expand our treatment of chemical reactions to solve stoichiometry problems for reactions that occur at any temperature and pressure.
