Q:
If you buy a can of paint at a paint store, a store employee may put the can on a shaker machine to mix up the paint in the can.
What type of mixture is the paint?
A:
The paint is a suspension.
Some of the components of the paint settle out of the mixture when it sits undisturbed for a long time.
This explains why you need to shake (or stir) the paint before you use it.
Q:
The milk you buy in the supermarket has gone through a process called homogenization.
This process breaks up the cream in the milk into smaller particles.
As a result, the cream doesn’t separate out of the milk no matter how long it sits on the shelf.
Which type of mixture is homogenized milk?
A:
Homogenized milk is a colloid.
The particles in the milk are large enough to see—that’s why milk is white instead of clear like water, which is the main component of milk.
However, the particles are not large enough to settle out of the mixture.
The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine, so they retain their physical properties.
Examples of physical properties include boiling point, ability to dissolve, and particle size.
