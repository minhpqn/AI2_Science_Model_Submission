Knowing the genotypes of each population member, we can count the number of alleles of each type in the gene pool.
The table shows how this is done.
Number of Individuals in the Population with that Genotype
Number of Allele A Contributed to the Gene Pool by that Genotype
Number of Allele a Contributed to the Gene Pool by that Genotype
Let the letter p stand for the frequency of allele A .
Let the letter q stand for the frequency of allele a .
We can calculate p and q as follows:
p = number of A alleles/total number of alleles = 140/200 = 0.7
q = number of a alleles/total number of alleles = 60/200 = 0.3
Notice that p + q = 1.
Evolution occurs in a population when allele frequencies change over time.
What causes allele frequencies to change?
That question was answered by Godfrey Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg in 1908 (see the Hardy-Weinberg Theorem concept).
Microevolution occurs over a short period of time in a population or species.
Macroevolution occurs over geologic time above the level of the species.
The population is the unit of evolution.
A populationâ€™s gene pool consists of all the genes of all the members of the population.
For a given gene, the population is characterized by the frequency of different alleles in the gene pool.
