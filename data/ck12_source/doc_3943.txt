It is also raising sea levels.
These changes threaten many species.
Pollution, which adds chemicals, heat, and noise to the environment beyond its capacity to absorb them.
This causes widespread harm to organisms.
Human overpopulation, which is crowding out other species.
It also makes all the other causes of extinction worse.

The brown tree snake is an exotic species that has caused many extinctions on Pacific islands such as Guam.
Effects of Extinction
The results of a study released in the summer of 2011 have shown that the decline in the numbers of large predators like sharks, lions and wolves is disrupting Earth's ecosystem in all kinds of unusual ways.
The study, conducted by scientists from 22 different institutions in six countries, confirmed the sixth mass extinction.
The study states that this mass extinction differs from previous ones because it is entirely driven by human activity through changes in land use, climate, pollution, hunting, fishing and poaching.
The effects of the loss of these large predators can be seen in the oceans and on land.
Fewer cougars in the western US state of Utah led to an explosion of the deer population.
The deer ate more vegetation, which altered the path of local streams and lowered overall biodiversity.
In Africa, where lions and leopards are being lost to poachers, there is a surge in the number of olive baboons, who are transferring intestinal parasites to humans living nearby.
In the oceans, industrial whaling led a change in the diets of killer whales, who eat more sea lions, seals, and otters and have dramatically lowered the population counts of those species.
The study concludes that the loss of big predators has likely driven many of the pandemics, population collapses and ecosystem shifts the Earth has seen in recent centuries.
