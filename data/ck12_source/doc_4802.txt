Many food manufacturers no longer use trans fatty acids for this reason.
These plant products all contain unsaturated fatty acids.
Types of Lipids
Lipids may consist of fatty acids alone or in combination with other compounds.
Several types of lipids consist of fatty acids combined with a molecule of alcohol:
Triglycerides are the main form of stored energy in animals.
This type of lipid is commonly called fat.
Triglycerides are composed of a glycerol and three fatty acid chains.
An example is shown in Figure below .
In humans, triglycerides are a mechanism for storing unused calories, and their high concentration in blood correlates with the consumption of excess starches and other carbohydrate-rich foods.
Phospholipids are a major component of the membranes surrounding the cells of all organisms, as they have the ability to form bilayers.
The structure of the phospholipid molecule consists of two hydrophobic tails (a diglyceride made of two fatty acid chains) and a hydrophilic head (a phosphate group, PO 4 3- ).
Steroids (or sterols) have several functions.
Sterols are a subgroup of steroids.
The sterol cholesterol is an important part of cell membranes and plays other vital roles in the body.
Cholesterol is a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones.
Steroid hormones include the male and female sex hormones.
Sterols also have roles as second messengers in signalling pathways.
