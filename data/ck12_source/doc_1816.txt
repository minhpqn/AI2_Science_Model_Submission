It also holds more water due to the presence of iron and clay.
There is less organic material in this layer.
The next layer down is the “C” horizon.
The C horizon is made of partially altered bedrock.
There is evidence of weathering in this layer.
Still, it is possible to identify the original rock type from which this soil formed ( Figure below ).

This image shows the various soil horizons.
Not all climate regions develop soils.
Arid regions are poor at soil development.
Not all regions develop the same soil horizons.
Some areas develop as many as five or six distinct layers.
Others develop only a few.
An animation of soil profile development can be viewed here:
Soil horizons are layers within a soil.
Different soil horizons show different amounts of alteration.
Soil profiles reveal the different layers of soil.
Soil layers include topsoil, subsoil, and the C horizon.
Topsoil has the highest proportion of organic material.
Topsoil is essential for farming.
