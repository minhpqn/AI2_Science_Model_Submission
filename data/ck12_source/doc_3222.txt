Like other waves, electromagnetic waves transfer energy from one place to another.
The transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves is called electromagnetic radiation .
Electromagnetic waves can transfer energy through matter or across empty space.

Q:
How do microwaves transfer energy inside a microwave oven?
A:
They transfer energy through the air inside the oven to the food.
May the Force Be with You
A familiar example may help you understand the vibrating electric and magnetic fields that make up electromagnetic waves.
Consider a bar magnet, like the one in the Figure below .
The magnet exerts magnetic force over an area all around it.
This area is called a magnetic field.
The field lines in the diagram represent the direction and location of the magnetic force.
Because of the field surrounding a magnet, it can exert force on objects without touching them.
They just have to be within its magnetic field.
