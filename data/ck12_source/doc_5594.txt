The force that causes two particles to pull towards each other
mass:
A measure of the amount of matter that an object contains.
The mass of an object is made in comparison to the standard mass of 1 kilogram.
weight:
A measure of force that is equal to the gravitational pull on an object.
The weight of an object is dependent on its location.
SI Kinetic Energy Units
Define kinetic energy.
Define potential energy.
Write the expression for calculating energy in joules.
A picture of a cat
Have you ever watched a cat in action?
When cats are chasing something, they move very fast.
We may comment, “That cat has a lot of energy”.
In saying that, we are more correct than we realize.
One form of energy is seen when an object is moving and this type of energy is the basis for many chemical processes.
SI Kinetic Energy Units
An object’s kinetic energy is the energy due to motion.
Kinetic energy can be defined mathematically as
