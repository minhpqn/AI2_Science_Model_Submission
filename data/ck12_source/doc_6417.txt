However, the variable  x will represent the concentration of the hydroxide ion.
The pH is found by taking the negative logarithm to get the pOH, followed by subtracting from 14 to get the pH.
The procedure for calculating the pH of a weak acid or base is illustrated.
Perform the calculations at the site below:
What does  x stand for in the equation?
What simplifying assumption is made?
What would  x stand for if we were calculating pOH?
Neutralization Reaction and Net Ionic Equations for Neutralization Reactions

Write net ionic equations for neutralization reactions.
Pouring concrete often generates alkaline waste that must first be neutralized
Who cleans up afterwards?
Pouring concrete and working it are messy jobs.
In the process, a lot of wastewater with an alkaline pH is generated.
Often, regulations require that this wastewater be cleaned up at the site.
One practical way to neutralize the basic pH is to bubble CO 2 into the water.
The carbon dioxide forms a weak acid (carbonic acid, H 2 CO 3 ) in solution which serves to bring the alkaline pH down to something closer to neutral.
Neutralization Reactions and Net Ionic Equations for Neutralization Reactions
A neutralization reaction is a reaction in which an acid and a base react in an aqueous solution to produce a salt and water.
