Where do reptiles live?
Anywhere and everywhere.
Shown here is a sea turtle.
Obviously, this reptile lives in the ocean.
But reptiles can also live in the desert, jungle, forest, or even your backyard.
Reptiles live in practically every type of habitat.
Ecology of Reptiles
Today, reptiles live in a wide range of habitats.
They can be found on every continent except Antarctica.
Many turtles live in the ocean, while others live in freshwater or on land.
Lizards are all terrestrial , but their habitats may range from deserts to rainforests, and from underground burrows to the tops of trees.
Most snakes are terrestrial and live in a wide range of habitats, but some snakes are aquatic .
Crocodilians live in and around swamps or bodies of freshwater or salt water.
What reptiles eat is also very diverse, but the majority of reptiles are carnivores .
Large reptiles such as crocodilians are the top predators in their ecosystems, preying on birds, fish, deer, turtles, and sometimes domestic livestock.
Their powerful jaws can crush bones and even turtle shells.
Smaller reptiles—including tuataras, snakes, and many lizards—are also important predators, preying on insects, frogs, birds, and small mammals such as mice.
Most terrestrial turtles are herbivores .
They graze on grasses, leaves, flowers, and fruits.
Marine turtles and some species of lizards are omnivores, feeding on plants as well as insects, worms, amphibians, and small fish.
