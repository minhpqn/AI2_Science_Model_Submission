Known for extremely long walking legs.
No silk nor poison glands.
Many are omnivores, eating small insects, plant material, and fungi.
Some are scavengers, eating decaying animal and other matter.
Mostly nocturnal (come out at night) and colored in hues of brown.
A number of diurnal (come out during the day) species have vivid patterns of yellow, green, and black.
Characterized by a tail with six segments, the last bearing a pair of venom glands and a venom-injecting barb.
Predators of small arthropods and insects.
They use pincers to catch prey.
Then they either crush it or inject it with a fast-acting venom, which is used to kill or paralyze the prey.
Only a few species are harmful to humans.
Nocturnal; during the day, they find shelter in holes or under rocks.
Unlike the majority of arachnids, scorpions produce live young.
The young are carried about on the motherâ€™s back until they have molted at least once.
They reach an age of between four to 25 years.
Mites and ticks
Most are small (no more than 1.0 mm in length), but some ticks, and one species of mite, may grow to be 10-20 mm in length.
Live in nearly every habitat, including aquatic and terrestrial.
Many are parasitic, affecting both invertebrates and vertebrates.
They may transmit diseases to humans and other mammals.
