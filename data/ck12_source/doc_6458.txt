Step 1:
Plan the problem .
Use the oxidation number rules to assign oxidation numbers to each atom in the balanced equation.
Coefficients do not affect oxidation numbers.
The oxidized atom increases in oxidation number and the reduced atom decreases in oxidation number.
Step 2:
Solve .
\overset{+3}{\text{Fe}_2} \overset{-2}{\text{O}_3} (s)+3 \overset{+2}{\text{C}} \overset{-2}{\text{O}} (g) \rightarrow 2 \overset{0}{\text{Fe}}(s)+3 \overset{+4}{\text{C}} \overset{-2}{\text{O}_2}(g)
The element carbon is oxidized because its oxidation number increases from +2 to +4.
The iron(III) ion within the Fe 2 O 3 is reduced because its oxidation number decreases from +3 to 0.
The carbon monoxide (CO) is the reducing agent since it contains the element that is oxidized.
The Fe 3+ ion is the oxidizing agent since it is reduced in the reaction.
Processes for determining which atoms are oxidized and which are reduced in a chemical reaction are described.
