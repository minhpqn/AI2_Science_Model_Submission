What occurs in and near subduction zones?
Why are earthquakes found at subduction zones?
Why are convergent plate boundary earthquakes at depths between surface to 700 km?
Why do you think the earthquakes stop at about 700 km?
Why does a subducting plate produce so many earthquakes?
What depths of earthquakes does a subducting plate produce?
What caused the most destruction from the 2011 Japan earthquake?
In the cart above of depth vs distance of the earthquakes, what is being outlined by the dots?
Identify the causes of intraplate earthquakes.
When can you go up in the Washington Monument again?
An earthquake in August 2011 in Virginia cracked the top of the Washington Monument.
After 32 months of repair, the monument reopened to the public.
Other sites in Washington, D.C., like the National Cathedral, were also damaged.
About 5% of earthquakes take place within a plate, away from plate boundaries.
These intraplate earthquakes are caused by stresses within a plate.
Since plates move over a spherical surface, zones of weakness are created.
Intraplate earthquakes happen along these zones of weakness.
The earthquakes may take place along ancient faults or rift zones.
2011 Virginia Earthquake
In August 2011, the eastern seaboard of the U.S. was rocked by a magnitude 5.8 earthquake.
