Mating and Courtship
Mating refers to the union of a male and female of the same species for reproduction.
The relationship between mates varies by species.
Adults may have many mates, or they may mate with just one individual.
Mates may stay together only while mating, for an entire breeding season, or even for life.
Females are likely to be more selective than males in choosing mates.
In many species, males put on courtship displays to encourage females to choose them as mates.
For example, to attract a mate, a male bowerbird builds an elaborate nest decorated with hundreds of small blue objects (see Figure below ).
