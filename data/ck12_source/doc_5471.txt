The Human Genome Project - Advanced
What is the Human Genome Project?
Describe the goals and the importance of the Human Genome Project.
Why is understanding the whole human genome important?
That's over 3,000,000,000 pieces of information.
The Human Genome Project was one of the great feats of exploration in history - an inward voyage of discovery rather than an outward exploration of the planet or the cosmos; an international research effort to sequence and map all of the genes - together known as the genome - of members of our species, Homo sapiens.
Completed in April 2003, the HGP gave us the ability to, for the first time, to read nature's complete genetic blueprint for building a human being. - National Human Genome Research Institute (

The Human Genome
All the DNA of the human species makes up the human genome .
This DNA consists of about 3 billion base pairs and is divided into thousands of genes on 23 pairs of chromosomes.
The human genome also includes regulatory and noncoding sequences of DNA, as shown in Figure below .
Human Genome, Chromosomes, and Genes.
Each chromosome of the human genome contains many genes as well as noncoding intergenic (between genes) regions.
Each pair of chromosomes is shown here in a different color.
In A genome is an entire set of genes at , James Watson discusses the human genome and the Human Genome Project.
The Human Genome Project
Thanks to the Human Genome Project (HGP) , scientists now know a consensus DNA sequence of the entire human genome.
The Human Genome Project was an international project that includes scientists from around the world.
It began in 1990, and by 2003, scientists had sequenced all 3 billion base pairs of human DNA.
