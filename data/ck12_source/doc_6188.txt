Electrolytes and Colligative Properties
Ionic compounds are electrolytes and dissociate into two or more ions as they dissolve.
This must be taken into account when calculating the freezing and boiling points of electrolyte solutions.
The sample problem below demonstrates how to calculate the freezing point and boiling point of a solution of calcium chloride.
Calcium chloride dissociates into three ions according to the equation:
\text{CaCl}_2 (s) \rightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} (aq)+2\text{Cl}^-(aq)
The values of the freezing point depression and the boiling point elevation for a solution of CaCl 2 will be three times greater than they would be for an equal molality of a nonelectrolyte.
Sample Problem:
Freezing and Boiling Point of an Electrolyte
Determine the freezing and boiling point of a solution prepared by dissolving 82.20 g of calcium chloride into 400.g of water.
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
mass CaCl 2 = 82.20 g
molar mass CaCl 2 = 110.98 g/mol
mass H 2 O = 400. g = 0.400 kg
K_f(\text{H}_2\text{O})=-1.86^\circ \ \text{C}/ m
K_b(\text{H}_2\text{O})=0.512^\circ \ \text{C}/ m
CaCl 2 dissociates into 3 ions
T_f=? \ ^\circ \text{C}
T_b=? \ ^\circ \text{C}
