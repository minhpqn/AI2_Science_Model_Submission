That’s what Thomson wanted to know.
Is it just a ray of energy that travels in waves like a ray of light?
That was one popular hypothesis at the time.
Or was a cathode ray a stream of moving particles?
That was the other popular hypothesis.
Thomson tested these ideas by placing negative and positive plates along the sides of the cathode ray tube to see how the cathode ray would be affected.
The cathode ray appeared to be repelled by the negative plate and attracted by the positive plate.
This meant that the ray was negative in charge and that is must consist of particles that have mass.
He called the particles “corpuscles,” but they were later renamed electrons.

Thomson also measured the mass of the particles he had identified.
He did this by determining how much the cathode rays were bent when he varied the voltage.
He found that the mass of the particles was 2000 times smaller than the mass of the smallest atom, the hydrogen atom.
In short, Thomson had discovered the existence of particles smaller than atoms.
This disproved Dalton’s claim that atoms are the smallest particles of matter.
From his discovery, Thomson also inferred that electrons are fundamental particles within atoms.
Q:
Atoms are neutral in electric charge.
How can they be neutral if they contain negatively charged electrons?
