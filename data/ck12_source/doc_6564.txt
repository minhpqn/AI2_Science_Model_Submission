Structure of an ester
The R group can either be a hydrogen atom or a carbon chain.
The R’ group must be a carbon chain since a hydrogen atom would make the molecule a carboxylic acid.
The steps for naming esters along with two examples are shown below.
Identify and name the alkyl group (R’) that has replaced the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group.
This is the first part of the ester name.
Name the carboxylic acid portion of the molecule (R-COO), but change the ending of the name from –oic acid to –oate .
This is the second part of the ester name.
Leave a space between the alkyl group name and the name of the carboxylic acid derivative.
Nomenclature of esters
Esters have lower boiling points than the carboxylic acids from which they were derived because they cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other.
This is because there are no hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms, as in the acid.
Esters with shorter carbon chains are soluble in water, while those with longer chains are less soluble.
Esters are very commonly found in plants and are responsible for many distinctive odors and flavors.
For example, methyl salicylate has the odor and flavor of oil of wintergreen, while propyl ethanoate has that of a pear.
