Picture of the Galilean moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto
The Galilean moons are as large as small planets.
Scientists think that Europa is a good place to look for extraterrestrial life.
Europa is the smallest of the Galilean moons.
The moon's surface is a smooth layer of ice.
Scientists think that the ice may sit on top of an ocean of liquid water.
How could Europa have liquid water when it is so far from the Sun?
Europa is heated by Jupiter.
Jupiter's tidal forces are so great that they stretch and squash its moon.
This could produce enough heat for there to be liquid water.
Numerous missions have been planned to explore Europa, including plans to drill through the ice and send a probe into the ocean.
However, no such mission has yet been attempted.
Photos from the Voyager missions showed that Jupiter has a ring system.
This ring system is very faint, so it is very difficult to observe from Earth.
Jupiter has fascinated scientists at least since Galileo turned his first telescope on the planet.
In 1979, two spacecrafts, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, visited Jupiter and its moons.
The Galileo orbiter orbited the planet for seven years and flew by all of the Galilean moons plus one other moon.
The orbiter released a probe to study the planet's atmosphere.
Future missions to Jupiter are underway.
Juno will arrive in late 2016.
