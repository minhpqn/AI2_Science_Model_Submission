There are no nerve endings in the nail.
Otherwise cutting your nails would hurt a lot!
Nails act as protective plates over the fingertips and toes.
Fingernails also help in sensing the environment.
The area under your nail has many nerve endings.
These nerve endings allow you to receive more information about objects you touch.
The Guinness Book of World Records began tracking record fingernail lengths in 1955.
At that time the record was 1 foot 10.75 inches long.
The current record-holder for men is from India, with a record of 20 feet 2.25 inches for all nails on his left hand, the longest being his thumbnail at 4 feet 9.6 inches.
The record for women is held by an American woman.
The record is 28 feet (850 cm) for all nails of both hands, with the longest nail on her right thumb at 2 feet 11 inches.
Since adult nails grow at about 3 mm a month (1/10 of an inch), how long would it take to grow such long nails?
Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals.
In fact, mammals are the only animals to have hair.
Hair sticks out from the epidermis, but it grows from the dermis ( Figure below ).
Hair grows from inside the hair follicle .
New cells grow in the bottom part of the hair, called the bulb.
Older cells get pushed up, and the hair grows longer.
The cells that make up the hair strand are dead and filled with the rope-like protein keratin.
