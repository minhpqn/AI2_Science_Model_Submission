Calcium-rich spring water enters the bottom of the lake.
The water bubbles up into the alkaline lake.
The calcite “tufa” towers form.
When the lake level drops, the tufa towers are revealed.
Tufa towers in Mono Lake
Tufa towers are found in interesting formations at Mono Lake, California.
Minerals from Hot Underground Water
Underground water can be heated by magma.
The hot water moves through cracks below Earth’s surface.
Hot water can hold more dissolved particles than cold water.
The hot, salty solution has chemical reactions with the rocks around it.
The water picks up more dissolved particles.
As it flows through open spaces in rocks, the water deposits solid minerals.
When a mineral fills cracks in rocks, the deposits are called veins .
Pictured below is a white quartz vein ( Figure below ).
When the minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals grow.
These rocks are called geodes.
Pictured below is a geode that was formed when amethyst crystals grew in an open space in a rock ( Figure below ).
