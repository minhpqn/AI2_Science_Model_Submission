Waves and currents carry sediment that they deposit on the shore.
Describe the landforms created by sediment deposition at the shore.
Which came first: erosion or deposition?
Both erosion and deposition are seen in this photo.
The beach sands were deposited but waves are now eroding them away.
At the shore, there's always a battle between the two types of forces.
What happens when deposition is greater than erosion?
What happens when erosion is greater than deposition?
The transport of sediments by longshore currents is called longshore drift .
Longshore drift is created in this way:
Sediment is moved up the beach by an incoming wave.
The wave approaches at an angle to the shore.
Water then moves straight offshore.
The sediment moves straight down the beach with it.
The sediment is again picked up by a wave that is coming in at an angle.
So longshore drift moves sediment along the shore.
This zig-zag motion is pictured below ( Figure below ) and can also be seen at the link below.

Longshore drift carries particles of sand and rock down a coastline.
