It usually holds water (in the form of water vapor) for just a few days.
Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a long period of time is called a reservoir .
The ocean is a reservoir for water.
The deep ocean may hold water for thousands of years.
Water on Earth is billions of years old.
However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle.
The water cycle is a global cycle.
It takes place on, above, and below Earthâ€™s surface, as shown in Figure below .
The water cycle takes place on, above, and below Earth's surface
Like other biogeochemical cycles, there is no beginning or end to the water cycle.
It just keeps repeating.
During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice).
Many processes are involved as water changes state in the water cycle.
See Watercourses at
. for a nice description of the flow of water.
Evaporation, Sublimation, and Transpiration
Water changes to a gas by three different processes:
Evaporation occurs when water on the surface changes to water vapor.
The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere.
Sublimation occurs when ice and snow change directly to water vapor.
