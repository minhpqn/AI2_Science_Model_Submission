P = ? [Pa]
Given: m = 340\ grams = 0.340\ kg
{\;}\qquad \quad \text{diameter} = 8.0\ cm = 0.08\ m
{\;}\qquad \quad g = 10\ m/s^2
Equations:
P = \frac{F}{A} Area of a circle:
A = \pi \cdot r^2
Plug n’ Chug:
P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{mg}{ \pi \cdot r^2} = \frac{(0.340 \ kg)\left (10 \frac{m}{s^2} \right )}{\pi \left (\frac{0.08 \ m}{2} \right )^2}= \left (\frac{3.4 \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}}{5.0 \times 10^{-3} m^2} \right ) = 680 \frac{N}{m^2} = 680 \ Pa
Answer: \boxed{\mathbf{680 \ Pa}}

Why does a sharp knife cut so much better than a dull one?
Every day Fakir likes to spend about an hour meditating on his bed of nails.
Fakir’s mass is 60 kg, his bed contains 2000 nails, and each nail point has a surface area of 4 \ mm^2 .
Calculate the total surface area of all the nail points, then convert that area into square meters.
Calculate the pressure exerted on Fakir by the nails.
Compare this to your answer from the previous question.
Estimate the pressure in Pascals that you exert on the ground when you stand in your bare feet flat compared to 'tippy toes'.
Clearly state your assumptions.
