The substance that loses electrons is being oxidized and is the reducing agent.
The substance that gains electrons is being reduced and is the oxidizing agent.
Step 2:
Solve .
\text{Cl}_2(g)+ \cancel{2\text{Na}^+(aq)}+2\text{Br}^-(aq) & \rightarrow \cancel{2\text{Na}^+(aq)}+2\text{Cl}^-(aq)+\text{Br}_2(l) \\\text{Cl}_2(g)+2\text{Br}^-(aq) & \rightarrow 2\text{Cl}^-(aq)+\text{Br}_2(l) \qquad (\text{net ionic reaction})
& \text{Oxidation:} \quad \text{Cl}_2(g)+2e^-(aq) \rightarrow 2\text{Cl}^-(aq) \\ & \text{Reduction:} \quad 2\text{Br}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{Br}_2 (l) + 2e^-
