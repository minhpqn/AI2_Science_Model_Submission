Why are many prokaryotes adapted for living at the normal internal temperature of the human body.
Compare psychrophiles to thermophiles.
Compare obligate aerobes to facultative anaerobes.
Explain how prokaryotes reproduce.
Define binary fission.
Describe bacterial conjugation.
How do bacteria reproduce?
Essentially, they grow and divide.
Show here is an example of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA, bacteria.
Notice how one bacterium is dividing into two.
Reproduction in Prokaryotes
Unlike multicellular organisms, increases in the size of prokaryotes (cell growth) and their reproduction by cell division are tightly linked.
Prokaryotes grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission.
For a discussion of exponential growth and bacteria see  (10:43).
Binary fission is a type of asexual reproduction.
It occurs when a parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells.
This can result in very rapid population growth.
For example, under ideal conditions, bacterial populations can double every 20 minutes.
Such rapid population growth is an adaptation to an unstable environment.
Can you explain why?
