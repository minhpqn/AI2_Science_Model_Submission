Properties of amorphous solids are different in many ways from those of crystalline solids.
The intermolecular force forces in amorphous solids are weaker than those in crystalline solids.
Amorphous solids do not have a regular external structure and they do not have sharp melting points.
Unlike crystalline solids that have regular planes of cleavage, the physical properties of amorphous solids are the same in all directions.
Plastics are used for many purposes because they are inexpensive to produce and do not shatters like glass or ceramic materials.
Since they are easily disposed of, the accumulation of plastic garbage has become a serious problem in many parts of the world.
Recycling programs that help reuse the plastics are growing in popularity.
Plastics are widely used amorphous solids
