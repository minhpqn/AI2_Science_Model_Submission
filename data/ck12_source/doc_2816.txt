He placed a bit of uranium on a photographic plate after exposing the uranium to sunlight.
The plate was similar to the film that is used today to take X-rays, and Becquerel expected the uranium to leave an image on the plate.
The next day, there was an image on the plate, just as Becquerel expected.
This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight.
Antoine Henri Becquerel
Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to confirm his results.
He placed more uranium on another photographic plate.
However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and uranium in a drawer to try again another day.
He wasn’t expecting the uranium to leave an image on the plate without first being exposed to sunlight.
To his surprise, there was an image on the plate in the drawer the next day.
Becquerel had discovered that uranium gives off rays of energy on its own.
He had discovered radioactivity, for which he received a Nobel prize.

Another scientist, who worked with Becquerel, actually came up with the term radioactivity .
The other scientist was the French chemist Marie Curie.
She went on to discover the radioactive elements polonium and radium.
She won two Nobel Prizes for her discoveries.

Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit charged particles and energy from its nucleus.
The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation.
