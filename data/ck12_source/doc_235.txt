Why was fixing this so important?
Why did they move the bullet being dropped to 360 ft away?
What was the final result?
What are some possible reasons that the bullets didn't hit the ground at exactly the same time?
If a bullet is fired from a high powered rifle at the exact time a duplicate bullet is dropped by hand near the barrel of the rifle, which bullet will hit the ground first?
the one dropped straight down
the one fired horizontally
both will hit the ground at the same time
A cannon is fired from the edge of a small cliff.  The height of the cliff is 80.0 m.  The cannon ball is fired with a perfectly horizontal velocity of 80.0 m/s.  How far will the cannon ball fly horizontally before it strikes the ground?
A cliff diver running 3.60 m/s dives out horizontally from the edge of a vertical cliff and reaches the water below 2.00 s later.  How high is the cliff and how far from the base of the cliff did the diver hit the water?
projectile motion:
A form of motion where a particle (called a projectile) is thrown obliquely near the earth's surface, & it moves along a curved path under the action of gravity.
The path followed by a projectile motion is called its trajectory.
Projectile motion only occurs when there is one force applied at the beginning of the trajectory after which there is no interference apart from gravity.
trajectory:  The path followed by an object in projectile motion.
Projectile Motion for an Object Launched at an Angle
Calculate height and range of projectiles launched at an angle.
Understand the independence of vertical and horizontal motion.
Understanding the physics before a human cannonball launch is very important
In the case of the human cannonball shown, all the vector and gravitational calculations must be worked out perfectly before the first practice session.
