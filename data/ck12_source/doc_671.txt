The ratio of the \sin\theta _r to  \sin\theta _i is 0.769 .  If the wavelength of a wave in a new medium is 5.00 \times 10^{-9} \ m , what is its wavelength in the original medium?
0.769=\frac{\lambda _r}{\lambda _i} \ so \ \lambda _i=\frac{5.00\times10^{-9} \ m}{0.769}=6.50\times10^{-9} \ m
When any wave strikes a boundary between media, some of the energy is reflected and some is transmitted.
When a wave strikes the media interface at an angle, the transmitted wave will move in a different direction than the incident wave.
This phenomenon is known as refraction.
At any media interface, \frac{\sin\theta_r}{\sin\theta_i}=\frac{v_r}{v_i}=\frac{\lambda _r}{\lambda _i}
