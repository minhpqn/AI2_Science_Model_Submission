Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron.
Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes.
Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification.
Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ).
Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb.

Sickle-cell anemia is a blood disease that is caused by an abnormally shaped hemoglobin protein in red blood cells.
Many of the red blood cells of a person with sickle-cell anemia are long and curved (sickle-shaped) ( Figure below ).
The long, sickle shape of the cells can cause them to get stuck in narrow blood vessels.
This clotting means that oxygen cannot reach the cells.
People with sickle-cell anemia are most often well but can occasionally have painful attacks.
The disease is not curable, but it can be treated with medicines.
