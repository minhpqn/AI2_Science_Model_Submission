In fact, fungi can be dependent on another organism for survival.
When two species live close together and form a relationship, it is called symbiosis .
Symbiosis can be beneficial to one or both organisms, or sometimes one organism hurts the other.
Some of the partners in these relationships include plants, algae, insects and other animals, and even humans.
Fungi and Plants
If it were not for fungi, many plants would go hungry.
In the soil, fungi grow closely around the roots of plants, and they begin to help each other.
The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling fungi are called mycorrhizae ( Figure below ).
As plants and fungi form a close relationship, the plant and the fungus “feed” one another.
The plant provides sugars to the fungus that the plant makes through photosynthesis, which the fungus cannot do.
The fungus then provides minerals and water to the roots of the plant.
Since the plant and the fungus are helping each other out, this is a mutualistic relationship , a type of symbiosis known as mutualism.
In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit.
Plant roots and fungi, mycorrhizae, help feed each other
These roots (brown) and the mycorrhizae (white) help to feed one another.
Have you ever seen an organism called a lichen?
Lichens are crusty, hard growths that you might find on trees, logs, walls, and rocks ( Figure below ).
Although lichens may not be the prettiest organisms in nature, they are unique.
A lichen is really two organisms, sometimes referred to as a composite organism, that live very closely together: a fungus and a bacterium or an alga.
The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside the fungus.
