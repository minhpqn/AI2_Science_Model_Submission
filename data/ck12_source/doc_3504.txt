The nucleus of a cell is a structure in the cytoplasm that is surrounded by a membrane (the nuclear membrane) and contains, and protects, most of the cell's DNA.
Based on whether they have a nucleus, there are two basic types of cells: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.
You can watch animations of both types of cells at the link below.
Prokaryotic cells are cells without a nucleus.
The DNA in prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm rather than enclosed within a nuclear membrane.
Prokaryotic cells are found in single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, like the one shown in Figure below .
Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes .
They were the first type of organisms to evolve and are still the most common organisms today.
A diagram of a typical prokaryotic cell and its structure
Prokaryotic Cell.
This diagram shows the structure of a typical prokaryotic cell, a bacterium.
Like other prokaryotic cells, this bacterial cell lacks a nucleus but has other cell parts, including a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA.
Identify each of these parts in the diagram.
Bacteria are described in the following video

Eukaryotic cells are cells that contain a nucleus.
A typical eukaryotic cell is shown in Figure below .
Eukaryotic cells are usually larger than prokaryotic cells, and they are found mainly in multicellular organisms.
Organisms with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes , and they range from fungi to people.
Eukaryotic cells also contain other organelles besides the nucleus.
