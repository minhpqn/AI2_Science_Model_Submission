Here is an example in the Northern Hemisphere.
A plane takes off from City A .
The pilot wants to land in City B, which is 500 miles due north.
But the plane will not arrive there without corrections.
City B was due north of City A when the plane took off.
But during the time it takes for the airplane to fly 500 miles, City B moves east.
This happens because of Earth's rotation.
So if the airplane flies due north, it will arrive at a different city, City C.
City C is west of City B (in the Northern Hemisphere).
To reach City B, the pilot should curve right while flying north.
The opposite happens in the Southern Hemisphere.
In the flights between cities pictured below ( Figure below ), the flight paths look curved.
Since a flight path must curve to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, can you tell which city the plane took off from in each case?
Flight paths look curved due to the Coriolis effect
The Coriolis effect is the reason that airlines' flight paths look curved, even though they are the shortest possible path.
Although these flight paths show curves, what's wrong with this picture? (The curves do not all follow the path due to Coriolis.)
Effect for Air or Water
As wind or an ocean current moves, the Earth spins underneath it.
Wind or water that travels toward the poles from the Equator curves to the east.
Wind or water that travels toward the Equator from the poles curves to the west.
