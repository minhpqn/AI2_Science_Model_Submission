Timeline of the Big Bang in relation to the expansion of the universe
Timeline of the Big Bang and the expansion of the Universe.
There is a great deal of evidence that the Universe started with a big bang.
The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted cosmological explanation of how the Universe formed.
Think about the expanding Universe, then reverse it.
If we start at the present and go back into the past, the Universe gets smaller.
What is the end result of a contracting Universe?
A point.
According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe began about 13.7 billion years ago.
Everything that is now in the Universe was squeezed into a point.
It was all in a single, hot, chaotic mass.
Then an enormous explosion—a big bang—took place.
The big bang caused the Universe to start expanding rapidly.
