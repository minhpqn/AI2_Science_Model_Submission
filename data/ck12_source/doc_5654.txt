A:
Isotopes of an element are named for their total number of protons and neutrons.
Q:
The element oxygen has 8 protons.
How many protons and neutrons are there in oxygen-17?
A:
Oxygen-17—like all atoms of oxygen—has 8 protons.
Its name provides the clue that it has a total of 17 protons and neutrons.
Therefore, it must have 9 neutrons (8 + 9 = 17).
Particles in Neutrons
Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons.
Each neutron contains three quarks, as shown in the diagram below.
Two of the quarks are called down quarks (d) and the third quark is called an up quark (u).
Gluons (represented by wavy black lines in the diagram) are fundamental particles that are given off or absorbed by quarks.
They carry the strong nuclear force that holds together quarks in a neutron.
A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom.
It is found in the nucleus and is neutral in electric charge.
It has about the same mass and diameter as a proton.
Neutrons are found in all atoms except for most atoms of hydrogen.
All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons, but they may vary in their numbers of neutrons.
