What does "gymnasium" mean?
Today a gymnasium means a place for playing indoor sports.
In ancient Greece, sports were done in the nude, so the word "gymnasium" is based on the Greek word for naked (gymnos).
The root word is the same for "gymnosperm," which means "naked seed." Gymnosperms are those plants that do not have a fruit encasing the seed.
Gymnosperms have seeds, but they do not produce fruit.
Instead, the seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in cones.
There are four phyla of gymnosperms:
Conifers , members of the phylum Coniferophyta , are probably the gymnosperms that are most familiar to you.
Conifers include trees such as pines, firs, spruces, cedars, and the coastal redwood trees in California, which are the tallest living vascular plants.
