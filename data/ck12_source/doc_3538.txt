Explain the significance of a concentration gradient.
Define passive transport.
List the three main kinds of passive transport.
What will eventually happen to these dyes?
They will all blend together.
The dyes will move through the water until an even distribution is achieved.
The process of moving from areas of high amounts to areas of low amounts is called diffusion.
Probably the most important feature of a cellâ€™s phospholipid membranes is that they are selectively permeable or semipermeable .
A membrane that is selectively permeable has control over what molecules or ions can enter or leave the cell, as shown in Figure below .
The permeability of a membrane is dependent on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins.
In this way, cell membranes help maintain a state of homeostasis within cells (and tissues, organs, and organ systems) so that an organism can stay alive and healthy.
Illustrates how a cell's selectively permeable membrane only allows certain molecules through
A selectively permeable membrane allows certain molecules through, but not others.
Transport Across Membranes
The molecular make-up of the phospholipid bilayer limits the types of molecules that can pass through it.
For example, hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ), can easily pass through the lipid bilayer, but ions such as calcium (Ca 2+ ) and polar molecules such as water (H 2 O) cannot.
The hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer does not allow ions or polar molecules through because these molecules are hydrophilic , or water loving.
In addition, large molecules such as sugars and proteins are too big to pass through the bilayer.
Transport proteins within the membrane allow these molecules to pass through the membrane, and into or out of the cell.
This way, polar molecules avoid contact with the nonpolar interior of the membrane, and large molecules are moved through large pores.
