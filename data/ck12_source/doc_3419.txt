What reason might there be for this observation?
Forming a Hypothesis
The next step in a scientific investigation is forming a hypothesis.
A hypothesis is a possible answer to a scientific question, but it isnâ€™t just any answer.
A hypothesis must be based on scientific knowledge, and it must be logical.
A hypothesis also must be falsifiable.
In other words, it must be possible to make observations that would disprove the hypothesis if it really is false.
Assume you know that some birds eat moths and that owls prey on other birds.
From this knowledge, you reason that eye spots scare away birds that might eat the moth.
This is your hypothesis.
Testing the Hypothesis
To test a hypothesis, you first need to make a prediction based on the hypothesis.
A prediction is a statement that tells what will happen under certain conditions.
It can be expressed in the form:
If A occurs, then B will happen.
Based on your hypothesis, you might make this prediction:
If a moth has eye spots on its wings, then birds will avoid eating it.
Next, you must gather evidence to test your prediction.
Evidence is any type of data that may either agree or disagree with a prediction, so it may either support or disprove a hypothesis.
Evidence may be gathered by an experiment .
