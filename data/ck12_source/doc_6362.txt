Nitroglycerin is tricky stuff.
An active ingredient in dynamite (where it is stabilized), “raw” nitroglycerin is very unstable.
Physical shock will cause the material to explode.
The reaction is shown below:
The explosion of nitroglycerin releases large volumes of gases and is very exothermic.
Reactions are favorable when they result in a decrease in enthalpy and an increase in entropy of the system.
When both of these conditions are met, the reaction occurs naturally.
A spontaneous reaction is a reaction that favors the formation of products at the conditions under which the reaction is occurring.
A roaring bonfire is an example of a spontaneous reaction, since it is exothermic (there is a decrease in the energy of the system as energy is released to the surroundings as heat).
The products of a fire are composed partly of gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor.
The entropy of the system increases during a combustion reaction.
The combination of energy decrease and entropy increase dictates that combustion reactions are spontaneous reactions.
Combustion reactions are generally spontaneous reactions
A nonspontaneous reaction is a reaction that does not favor the formation of products at the given set of conditions.
In order for a reaction to be nonspontaneous, it must be endothermic, accompanied by a decrease in entropy, or both.
Our atmosphere is composed primarily of a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases.
One could write an equation showing these gases undergoing a chemical reaction to form nitrogen monoxide.
Fortunately, this reaction is nonspontaneous at normal temperatures and pressures.
It is a highly endothermic reaction with a slightly positive entropy change (\Delta \text{S}) .
Nitrogen monoxide is capable of being produced at very high temperatures and has been observed to form as a result of lightning strikes.
