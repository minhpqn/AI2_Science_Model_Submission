This is a decomposition reaction.
What Is a Decomposition Reaction?
A decomposition reaction occurs when one reactant breaks down into two or more products.
It can be represented by the general equation:
AB → A + B
In this equation, AB represents the reactant that begins the reaction, and A and B represent the products of the reaction.
The arrow shows the direction in which the reaction occurs.
Q:
What is the chemical equation for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to water (H 2 O) and oxygen (O 2 )?
A:
The equation for this decomposition reaction is:
2 H 2 O 2 → 2 H 2 O + O 2

Carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ) is an ingredient in soft drinks.
A decomposition reaction takes place when carbonic acid breaks down to produce water (H 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).
This occurs when you open a can of soft drink and some of the carbon dioxide fizzes out.
The equation for this reaction is:
H 2 CO 3 → H 2 O + CO 2
