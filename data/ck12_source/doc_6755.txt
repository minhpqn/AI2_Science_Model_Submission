Solve problems involving elastic collisions.
\sum p_{\text{initial}} = \sum p_{\text{final}} \; \; \text{The total momentum does not change in closed systems}
\sum KE_{\text{initial}} = \sum KE_{\text{final}} \; \; \text{The total kinetic energy does not change in elastic collisions}
An elastic collision is a collision where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.
The only true case of elastic collisions are in particle physics.
However, pool balls, bumper cars, etc. loose very little of their kinetic energy during the collision and approximate an elastic collision.
These types of collisions are used as elastic collision problems.
In elastic collisions the objects can not stick together (this would suck kinetic energy out of the system)
In elastic collisions one can use conservation of momentum and conservation of energy to solve the problem
