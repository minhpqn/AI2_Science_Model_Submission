Weather and Climate
What's the difference between weather and climate?
When you think of Greece, you probably think of sunshine and white buildings.
Maybe a beautiful beach.
All of these are typical of Greece, which has a warm Mediterranean climate.
In the winter, snow sometimes blankets the highlands.
Rarely, though, it snows in the Greek lowlands.
Snow is so uncommon in Athens that when it happens it brings the city to a standstill.
The Acropolis sits on a rocky outcrop above Athens.
It's beautiful, but rare, to see this ancient ruin covered with snow.
The weather in the photo on the right is cold and snowy, but the climate is still Mediterranean.
Climate is the long-term average of weather.
