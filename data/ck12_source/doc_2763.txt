Types of lipids include fats and oils.
Both fats and oils consist of long chains called fatty acids, which may be saturated or unsaturated.
Some lipids, called phospholipids, contain phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Two layers of phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things.
