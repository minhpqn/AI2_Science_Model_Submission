(11 \ \mu \text{g}) \left(\frac{1 \ \text{g}}{1 \times 10^6 \ \mu \text{g}}\right) \left(\frac{1000 \ \text{mg}}{1 \ \text{g}}\right)=1.1 \times 10^{-2} \ \text{mg}
11 µg is 1.1 × 10 -2  mg.
Measurements (quantitative observations) are often more useful than qualitative observations.
The system of units for measurements in physics is the SI system.
The fundamental quantities in the SI system are length, mass, and time.
The SI unit for length is the meter, for time is the second, and for mass is the kilogram.
Prefixes are used to change SI units by powers of ten.
Equivalencies are used as conversion factors when units need to be converted.
Use this resource to help understand using conversion factors, and complete the problems below.
