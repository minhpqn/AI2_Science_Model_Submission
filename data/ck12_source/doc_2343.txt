They are how scientists add to scientific knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world.
Scientific investigations produce evidence that helps answer questions.
Even if the evidence cannot provide answers, it may still be useful.
It may lead to new questions for investigation.
As more knowledge is discovered, science advances.
Steps of a Scientific Investigation
Scientists investigate the world in many ways.
In different fields of science, researchers may use different methods and be guided by different theories and questions.
However, most scientists follow the general steps outlined in the Figure below .
This approach is sometimes called the scientific method.
Keep in mind that the scientific method is a general approach and not a strict sequence of steps.
For example, scientists may follow the steps in a different order.
Or they may skip or repeat some of the steps.

Using the Scientific Method: a Simple Example
A simple example will help you understand how the scientific method works.
While Cody eats a bowl of cereal ( Figure below ), he reads the ingredients list on the cereal box.
He notices that the cereal contains iron.
Cody is studying magnets in school and knows that magnets attract objects that contain iron.
