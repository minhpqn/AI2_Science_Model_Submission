Heat Transfer in the Atmosphere
Explain how radiation, conduction and convection work in the atmosphere.
Can you see energy moving?
It's hard to see energy moving.
But energy is the reason that air moves, and it is sometimes possible to see that.
In this photo, differences in temperature are causing air to moveâ€”in fantastic ways!
How Energy Moves Through the Atmosphere
Energy travels through space or material.
Heat energy is transferred in three ways: radiation, conduction, and convection.
Radiation is the transfer of energy by waves.
Energy can travel as electromagnetic waves through air or empty space.
The Sun's energy travels through space by radiation.
After sunlight heats the planet's surface, some heat radiates back into the atmosphere.
In conduction , heat is transferred from molecule to molecule by contact.
Warmer molecules vibrate faster than cooler ones.
They bump into the cooler molecules.
When they do, they transfer some of their energy.
