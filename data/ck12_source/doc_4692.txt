A Scientific View of the World
Examine a scientistâ€™s view of the world.
Explain the relationship between science and nature.
Define scientific law.
Discuss why science is unable to answer all questions.
What would be a scientific view of the world ?
It could be said that the scientific view of the world is based on proven answers to specific questions.
For example, "How old are recently identified fossils?
What are the consequences of mutations in a certain gene?
How does the endocrine system help maintain homeostasis?".
These questions have definite answers which can help expand the scientific view of the world.
Questions that cannot be answered with definitive answers, questions that cannot be proved with evidence, are not based on science.
The scientific view of the world would not include answers to such questions.
A Scientific View of the World
Science is based on the analysis of observations made either through our senses or by using special equipment.
Science therefore cannot explain anything about the natural world that is beyond what is observable.
The term supernatural refers to entities, events, or powers regarded as being beyond nature, in that such things cannot be explained by scientific means.
They are not measurable or observable in the same way the natural world is, and are therefore considered to be outside the realm of scientific examination.
When a natural occurrence which was previously considered supernatural is understood in the terms of natural causes and consequences, it has a scientific explanation.
For example, the flickering lights sometimes seen hovering over damp ground on still evenings or nights are commonly called Will-o'-the-wisp .
