Warm air heating system
Warm-air heating system.
Q:
How does a home heating system “know” when to run and when to stop running?
A:
A home heating system is turned on or off by a thermostat.
How a Thermostat Works
A thermostat , like the one seen in the Figure below , is an important part of any home heating system.
It is like the “brain” of the entire system.
It constantly monitors the temperature in the home and “tells” the boiler or furnace when to turn on or off.
The thermostat is set at a selected temperature, say 71 °F.
When the temperature in the home starts to fall below this point, the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace to start running.
When the temperature starts to rise above this point, the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace to stop running.
In this way, the thermostat maintains the home’s temperature at the set point.
Thermostats help regulate temperature
Types of home heating systems include hot-water, warm-air, and solar heating systems.
All of them have the same basic function: producing thermal energy and transferring it to air throughout the house.
A hot-water heating system burns fuel in a boiler to produce thermal energy.
The thermal energy is used to heat water, which is pumped through a system of pipes and radiators.
A warm-air heating system burns fuel in a furnace to produce thermal energy.
