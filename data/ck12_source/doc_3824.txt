Wilhelm Weinberg was a German doctor.
Each worked alone to come up with the founding principle of population genetics.
Today, that principle is called the Hardy-Weinberg theorem .
It shows that allele frequencies do not change in a population if certain conditions are met.
Such a population is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium .
The conditions for equilibrium are:
No new mutations are occurring.
Therefore, no new alleles are being created.
There is no migration .
In other words, no one is moving into or out of the population.
The population is very large.
Mating is at random in the population.
This means that individuals do not choose mates based on genotype.
There is no natural selection.
Thus, all members of the population have an equal chance of reproducing and passing their genes to the next generation.
When all these conditions are met, allele frequencies stay the same.
Genotype frequencies also remain constant.
In addition, genotype frequencies can be expressed in terms of allele frequencies, as the Table below shows.
For a further explanation of this theorem, see Solving Hardy Weinberg Problems at
Hardy and Weinberg used mathematics to describe an equilibrium population ( p = frequency of A , q = frequency of a , so p + q = 1): p 2 + 2 pq + q 2 = 1.
