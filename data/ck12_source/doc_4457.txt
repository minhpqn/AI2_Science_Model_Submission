The most basic parts of the human machine are cells—an amazing 100 trillion of them by the time the average person reaches adulthood!
Cells are the basic units of structure and function in the human body, as they are in all living things.
Each cell carries out basic life processes that allow the body to survive.
Many human cells are specialized in form and function, as shown in Figure below .
Each type of cell in the figure plays a specific role.
For example, nerve cells have long projections that help them carry electrical messages to other cells.
Muscle cells have many mitochondria that provide the energy they need to move the body.

Different types of cells in the human body are specialized for specific jobs.
Do you know the functions of any of the cell types shown here?
After the cell, the tissue is the next level of organization in the human body.
A tissue is a group of connected cells that have a similar function.
There are four basic types of human tissues: epithelial, muscle, nervous, and connective tissues.
These four tissue types, which are shown in Figure below , make up all the organs of the human body.
An illustration of the four tissue types found in the human body
The human body consists of these four tissue types.
Connective tissue is made up of cells that form the body’s structure.
Examples include bone and cartilage.
