There is equal likelihood that the activated complex either reforms the original reactants or goes on to form products.
The Figure below shows the formation of a possible activated complex between colliding hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
Because of their unstable nature and brief existence, very little is known about the exact structures of many activated complexes.
An activated complex occurs when colliding particles are at the peak of the potential energy curve
An activated complex is a short-lived state in which the colliding particles are at the peak of the potential energy curve.
The role of the activated complex in reactions is described.
