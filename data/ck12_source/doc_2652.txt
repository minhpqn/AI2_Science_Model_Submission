What would the back and forth movement of the ball represent?
The answer is a covalent bond.
A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons.
The shared electrons are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms.
This forms a molecule consisting of two or more atoms.
Covalent bonds form only between atoms of nonmetals.
Covalent Compounds and Diatomic Elements
The two atoms that are held together by a covalent bond may be atoms of the same element or different elements.
When atoms of different elements form covalent bonds, a new substance, called a covalent compound, results.
Water is an example of a covalent compound.
A water molecule is modeled in the Figure below .
A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties of the compound.
Electron sharing in water molecule
Q:
How many valence electrons does the oxygen atom (O) share with each hydrogen atom (H)?
How many covalent bonds hold the water molecule together?
A:
The oxygen atom shares one pair of valence electrons with each hydrogen atom.
Each pair of shared electrons represents one covalent bond, so two covalent bonds hold the water molecule together.
The diagram in the Figure below shows an example of covalent bonds between two atoms of the same element, in this case two atoms of oxygen.
