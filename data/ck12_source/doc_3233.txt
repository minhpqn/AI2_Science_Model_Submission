Q:
Besides visible light and infrared light, what other kinds of electromagnetic radiation will the boys be exposed to in sunlight?
A:
Sunlight consists of all the different kinds of electromagnetic radiation, from harmless radio waves to deadly gamma rays.
Fortunately, Earth’s atmosphere prevents most of the harmful radiation from reaching Earth’s surface.
You can read about the different kinds of electromagnetic radiation in this article.
Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter.
Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun.
Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies.
Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves.
Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time.
Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.
A Spectrum of Electromagnetic Waves
Visible light and infrared light are just a small part of the full range of electromagnetic radiation, which is called the electromagnetic spectrum .
You can see the waves of the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure below .
At the top of the diagram, the wavelengths of the waves are given.
Also included are objects that are about the same size as the corresponding wavelengths.
The frequencies and energy levels of the waves are shown at the bottom of the diagram.
Some sources of the waves are also given.
