What did Mendel always see in the F1 generation?
What did Mendel always see in the F2 generation?
Summarize Mendel's conclusions from these experiments.
Pea Experiment at
Describe in general terms Mendel’s first set of experiments.
State Mendel's first law.
Assume you are investigating the inheritance of stem length in pea plants.
You cross-pollinate a short-stemmed plant with a long-stemmed plant.
All of the offspring have long stems.
Then, you let the offspring self-pollinate.
Describe the stem lengths you would expect to find in the second generation of offspring.
Mendel's Second Set of Experiments
Define dihybrid cross.
Explain Mendel's second set of experiments.
Describe the results of Mendel’s second group of experiments.
Summarize the law of independent assortment.
Round and green, round and yellow, wrinkled and green, or wrinkled and yellow?
Can two traits be inherited together?
Or are all traits inherited separately?
Mendel asked these questions after his first round of experiments.
