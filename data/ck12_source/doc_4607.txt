Include the role of antibodies in your response.
If a disease destroyed a person’s helper T cells, how might this affect the ability to launch an immune response?
What are memory cells?
What is their role?
Cell-Mediated Immune Response
Describe the cell-mediated immune response.
Identify the roles of T cells in a cell-mediated immune response.
Summarize how T cells are activated.
Distinguish between helper T cells, memory cells, cytotoxic T cells, and regulatory T cells.
Do cells really attack other cells?
They sure do.
Depicted here is a group of T cells attacking a cancer cell.
When they can, the T cells search out and destroy “bad” cells.
Cell-Mediated Immune Response
In addition to the humoral response, the other type of immune response is the cell-mediated immune response , which involves mainly T cells .
It leads to the destruction of cells that are infected with viruses.
Some cancer cells are also destroyed in this way.
There are several different types of T cells involved in a cell-mediated immune response, including helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells.
You can watch an animation of this type of immune response at this link:
