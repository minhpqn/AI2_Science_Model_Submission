Butterflies receive nectar when they deposit pollen into flowers, resulting in cross-pollination.
Fungi can also reproduce sexually, but instead of female and male sexes, they have (+) and (-) strains.
When the filaments of a (+) and (-) fungi meet, the zygote is formed.
Just like in plants and animals, each zygote receives DNA from two parent strains.
Types of asexual reproduction, when a new individual is formed from a single parent, include binary fission in bacteria and parthenogenesis in some animals.
During sexual reproduction in animals, fertilization can be internal or external.
Cross-pollination allows sexual reproduction in plants.
