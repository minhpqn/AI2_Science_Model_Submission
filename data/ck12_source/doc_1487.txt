Shape of the Ocean Basins
A surface current move across the ocean.
Eventually, the current runs into land ( Figure below ).
When it does, it turns right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere.
The direction is due to Coriolis effect.
Map of the major surface ocean currents
The major surface ocean currents.
The major surface currents are pictured below ( Figure below ).
They flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere.
In the Southern Hemisphere, they flow in the opposite direction.
These loops are called gyres .
Only the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows nonstop around the globe.

Earthâ€™s surface currents flow in the patterns shown here.
This video shows the surface ocean currents set by global wind belts:

Local Surface Currents
Currents are also found along shorelines ( Figure below ).
They are not related to the global wind belts.
Two are longshore currents and rip currents .
