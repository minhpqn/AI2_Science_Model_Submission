Your friend's instrument is in tune and is playing a note at 256 Hz, but you are slightly out of tune and are playing a note at 258 Hz.
What is the beat frequency?
1.9 Hz or 2.1 Hz
Describe the Doppler effect and use the Doppler shift equations to determine frequencies and speeds.
Students will learn what the Doppler effect is and how to determine frequencies and speeds using the Doppler shift equations.
Doppler Shifts : f_o &= f \frac{v+v_o}{v-v_s} && f_o \mathrm{~(observed~frequency)~is~shifted~up~when~source~and~observer~moving~closer}\\\f_o &= f \frac{v-v_o}{v+v_s} && f_o \mathrm{~(observed~frequency)~is~shifted~down~when~source~and~observer~moving~apart, where}\\\& && v \text{ is the speed of sound, } v_s \text{ is the speed of the source, and } v_o \text{ is the speed of the observer}
Guidance The Doppler Effect occurs when either the source of a wave or the observer of a wave (or both) are moving.
When a source of a wave is moving towards you, the apparent frequency of the wave you detect is higher than that emitted.
For instance, if a car approaches you while playing a note at 500 Hz, the sound you hear will be slightly higher frequency.
The opposite occurs (the frequency observed is lower than emitted) for a receding wave or if the observer moves away from the source.
It’s important to note that the speed of the wave does not change –it’s traveling through the same medium so the speed is the same.
Due to the relative motion between the source and the observer the frequency changes, but not the speed of the wave.
Note that while the effect is similar for light and electromagnetic waves the formulas are not exactly the same as for sound.
Question :
How fast would a student playing an A note ( 440\mathrm{Hz} ) have to move towards you in order for you to hear a G note ( 784\mathrm{Hz} )?
Answer :
We will use the Doppler shift equation for when the objects are getting closer together and solve for the speed of the student (the source).
f_o=f(\frac{v+v_o}{v-v_s}) \Rightarrow f_o\times (v-v_s)=f\times (v+v_o) \Rightarrow vf_o-v_sf_o=f\times (v+v_o) \Rightarrow v_s=-(\frac{f\times (v+v_o)-vf_o}{f_o})
Now we plug in the known values to solve for the velocity of the student.
v_s=-(\frac{f\times (v+v_o)-vf_o}{f_o})=-(\frac{440\mathrm{Hz}\times (343\mathrm{m/s}+0\mathrm{m/s})-343\mathrm{m/s}\times 784\mathrm{Hz}}{784\mathrm{Hz}})=151\mathrm{m/s}
