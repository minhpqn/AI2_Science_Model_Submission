What units are used to measure weight?
The mass of an object on the Earth is 100. kg.
What is the weight of the object on the Earth?
What is the mass of the object on the moon?
Assuming the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is exactly one-sixth of the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, what is the weight of the object on the moon?
A man standing on the Earth can exert the same force with his legs as when he is standing on the moon.
We know that the mass of the man is the same on the Earth and the moon.
We also know that F = ma is true on both the Earth and the moon.
Will the man be able to jump higher on the moon than the Earth?
Why or why not?
mass:
The mass of an object is measured in kilograms and is defined as the amount of matter in an object.
weight:
The weight of an object on the Earth is defined as the force acting on the object by the Earth's gravity.
Define static and sliding friction.
Explain the causes of surface friction.
