Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it.
For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began.
In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared.
Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes.
In fact, the theory suggests humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago.
These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology.
Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since.
Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection, presenting a great deal of evidence to support his theory.
