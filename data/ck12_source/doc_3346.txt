Objects can become permanently magnetized
Q:
Even permanent magnets can be demagnetized if they are dropped or heated to high temperatures.
Can you explain why?
A:
Jarring or heating a magnet moves the magnetic domains out of alignment.
When the magnetic domains no longer line up in the same direction, the material is no longer magnetic.
Some materials are natural permanent magnets.
The most magnetic material in nature is the mineral magnetite, also called lodestone (see Figure below ).
The magnetic domains of magnetite naturally align with Earthâ€™s axis.
The picture on the left shows a chunk of magnetite attracting small bits of iron.
The magnetite spoon compass shown on the right dates back about 2000 years and comes from China.
The handle of the spoon always points north.
Clearly, the magnetic properties of magnetite have been recognized for thousands of years.

Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet.
A material can be magnetized if all of its magnetic domains can be aligned.
Magnetic domains are regions of matter where north and south poles of atoms line up in the same direction.
Only certain materials, called ferromagnetic materials, can be magnetized.
They include iron, cobalt, and nickel.
