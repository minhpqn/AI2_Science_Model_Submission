As a result, bonds form between the DNA strands and primers.
Extension occurs when an enzyme ( Taq polymerase or Taq DNA polymerase) adds nucleotides to the primers.
This produces new DNA molecules, each incorporating one of the original DNA strands.
Polymerase chain reaction process
The Polymerase Chain Reaction.
The polymerase chain reaction involves three steps.
High temperatures are needed for the process to work.
The enzyme Taq polymerase is used in step 3 because it can withstand high temperatures.
Biotechnology is the use of technology to change the genetic makeup of living things for human purposes.
Gene cloning is the process of isolating and making copies of a DNA segment such as a gene.
The polymerase chain reaction makes many copies of a gene or other DNA segment.
