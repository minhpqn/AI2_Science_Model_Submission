Consider water as an example.
A molecule of water always contains one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen.
The composition of water is expressed by the chemical formula H 2 O.
A model of a water molecule is shown in Figure below .
Water is not an organic compound.
Structure of a water molecule
A water molecule always has this composition, one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen.
What causes the atoms of a water molecule to “stick” together?
The answer is chemical bonds.
A chemical bond is a force that holds molecules together.
Chemical bonds form when substances react with one another.
A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into others.
A chemical reaction is needed to form a compound.
Another chemical reaction is needed to separate the substances in a compound.
Why is carbon so basic to life?
The reason is carbon’s ability to form stable bonds with many elements, including itself.
This property allows carbon to form a huge variety of very large and complex molecules.
In fact, there are nearly 10 million carbon-based compounds in living things!
However, the millions of organic compounds can be grouped into just four major types: carbohydrates , lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids .
You can compare the four types in Table below .
