The electron transport chains are on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.
As the high-energy electrons are transported along the chains, some of their energy is captured.
This energy is used to pump hydrogen ions (from NADH and FADH 2 ) across the inner membrane, from the matrix into the intermembrane space.
Electron transport in a mitochondrion is shown in Figure below .
Electron transport chains are the last step of cellular respiration
Electron-transport chains on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion carry out the last stage of cellular respiration.
The pumping of hydrogen ions across the inner membrane creates a greater concentration of the ions in the intermembrane space than in the matrix.
This chemiosmotic gradient causes the ions to flow back across the membrane into the matrix, where their concentration is lower.
ATP synthase acts as a channel protein, helping the hydrogen ions cross the membrane.
It also acts as an enzyme, forming ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.
After passing through the electron-transport chain, the “spent” electrons combine with oxygen to form water.
This is why oxygen is needed; in the absence of oxygen, this process cannot occur.
How much ATP is produced?
The two NADH produced in the cytoplasm produces 2 to 3 ATP each (4 to 6 total) by the electron transport system, the 8 NADH produced in the mitochondria produces three ATP each (24 total), and the 2 FADH 2 adds its electrons to the electron transport system at a lower level than NADH, so they produce two ATP each (4 total).
This results in the formation of 34 ATP during the electron transport stage.

Electron transport is the final stage of aerobic respiration.
In this stage, energy from NADH and FADH 2 is transferred to ATP.
