A food intolerance , or food sensitivity, is different from a food allergy.
A food intolerance happens when the digestive system is unable to break down a certain type of food.
This can result in stomach cramping, diarrhea, tiredness, and weight loss.
Food intolerances are often mistakenly called allergies.
Lactose intolerance is a food intolerance.
A person who is lactose intolerant does not make enough lactase, the enzyme that breaks down the milk sugar, lactose.
Lactose intolerance may be as high as 75% in some populations, but overall the percentage of affected individuals is much less.
Still, well over 10% of the world's population is lactose intolerant.
Foodborne illness can be prevented by taking precautions during food preparation.
Food allergies and food intolerance can upset your digestive system.
