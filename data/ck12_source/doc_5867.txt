Making soap requires a base, lye
What different things are these workers doing to make soap?
Soap making has a long history.  Until recently, soap was made using animal fats and lye from wood ashes.  The lye served as a base to break down the fats and help form the soap.  Needless to say, unless the soap was washed to remove the lye, it was very harsh on the skin.
Many families would make their own soap by boiling the lye and fat in a large kettle over an open fire, a long and hot task.
The simplest way to define a base is an ionic compound that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water.  One of the most commonly used bases is sodium hydroxide, illustrated below.
Picture and structure of sodium hydroxide
(A) Sodium hydroxide, a base, is a solid that is typically produced as small white pellets. (B) The structure of sodium hydroxide is an extended three-dimensional network.
The purple spheres are the sodium ions (Na + ).
