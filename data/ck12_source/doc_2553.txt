A neon atom has two electrons in energy level I and its remaining eight electrons in energy level II, which can hold only eight electrons.
This means that is outermost energy level is full.
Therefore, a neon atom is very stable.
Energy levels (also called electron shells) are fixed distances from the nucleus of an atom where electrons may be found.
As you go farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher energy levels have more energy.
Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible, and then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on.
The maximum number of electrons at a given energy level depends on its number of orbitals.
There are at most two electrons per orbital.
Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom are called valence electrons.
They determine many of the properties of an atom, including how reactive it is.
