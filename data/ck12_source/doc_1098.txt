This radiation exists all around you.
You just can’t see it!
Every star, including our Sun, emits radiation of many wavelengths.
Astronomers can learn a lot from studying the details of the spectrum of radiation from a star.
The electromagnetic spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays.
Many extremely interesting objects can’t be seen with the unaided eye.
Astronomers use telescopes to see objects at wavelengths all across the electromagnetic spectrum.
Some very hot stars emit light primarily at ultraviolet wavelengths.
There are extremely hot objects that emit X-rays and even gamma rays.
Some very cool stars shine mostly in the infrared light wavelengths.
Radio waves come from the faintest, most distant objects.

Electromagnetic radiation is energy transmitted as waves with different wavelengths.
This makes up the electromagnetic spectrum.
Light travels very fast but still takes a long time to get across space.
A light-year is the distance light can travel in one year.
From longest wavelengths to shortest wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum is: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
