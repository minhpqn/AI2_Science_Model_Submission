Writing Formulas for Acids
Like other compounds that we have studied, acids are electrically neutral.  Therefore, the charge of the anion part of the formula must be exactly balanced out by the H + ions.  Since H + ions carry a single negative charge, the number of H + ions in the formula is equal to the quantity of the negative charge on the anion.
Two examples from the table above illustrate this point.
The chloride ion carries a 1− charge, so only one H is needed in the formula of the acid (HCl).
The sulfate ion carries a 2− charge, so two H’s are needed in the formula of the acid (H 2 SO 4 ).  Another way to think about writing the correct formula is to utilize the crisscross method, shown below for sulfuric acid.

Acids are molecular compounds that release hydrogen ions.
A binary acid consists of hydrogen and one other element.
Oxoacids contain hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element.
The name of the acid is based on the anion attached to the hydrogen.
Writing formulas for acids follows the same rules as for binary ionic compounds.
