States of Matter
List the points of the kinetic-molecular-theory.
Because so much volume of a gas is empty space, gases are easily compressed into smaller volumes
How much oxygen is in this container?
Approximately 20% of the atmosphere is oxygen.
This gas is essential for life.
In environments where oxygen is in low supply, it can be provided from a tank.
Since gases are very compressible, a large amount of oxygen can be stored in a relatively small container.
When it is released, the volume expands and the pressure decreases.
The gas is then available for breathing under normal pressure.
The Kinetic-Molecular Theory
The kinetic-molecular theory is a theory that explains the states of matter and is based on the idea that matter is composed of tiny particles that are always in motion.
The theory helps explain observable properties and behaviors of solids, liquids, and gases .
However, the theory is most easily understood as it applies to gases and it is with gases that we will begin our detailed study.
The theory applies specifically to a model of a gas called an ideal gas .
An ideal gas is an imaginary gas whose behavior perfectly fits all the assumptions of the kinetic-molecular theory.
In reality, gases are not ideal, but are very close to being so under most everyday conditions.
The kinetic-molecular theory as it applies to gases has five basic assumptions.
Gases consist of very large numbers of tiny spherical particles that are far apart from one another compared to their size .
The particles of a gas may be either atoms or molecules.
