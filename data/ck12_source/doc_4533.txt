This type of feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become too extreme.
The thyroid gland is a good example of this type of regulation.
It is controlled by the negative feedback loop shown in Figure below .

Regulation of the thyroid gland
The thyroid gland is regulated by a negative feedback loop.
The loop includes the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in addition to the thyroid.
Hereâ€™s how thyroid regulation works.
The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone, or TRH.
TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH.
TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete its hormones.
When the level of thyroid hormones is high enough, the hormones feedback to stop the hypothalamus from secreting TRH and the pituitary from secreting TSH.
Without the stimulation of TSH, the thyroid gland stops secreting its hormones.
Soon, the level of thyroid hormone starts to fall too low.

Negative feedback also controls insulin secretion by the pancreas.
You can interact with a feedback loop of this process at the link below.
Positive feedback occurs when a product feeds back to increase its own production.
