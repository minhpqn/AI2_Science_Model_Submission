Strength of Acids
The strength of acids is measured on a scale called the pH scale.
The pH value of a solution represents its concentration of hydrogen ions.
A pH value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and a pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution.
The lower the pH value is, the greater is the concentration of hydrogen ions and the stronger the acid.
The strongest acids, such as battery acid, have pH values close to zero.
Uses of Acids
Acids have many important uses, especially in industry.
For example, sulfuric acid is used to manufacture a variety of different products, including paper, paint, and detergent.
Some other uses of acids are be seen in the Figure below .
Uses of acid
Nitric acid and Phosphoric acid:
Both nitric acid and phosphoric acid are used to make fertilizer.
Hydrochloric acid:
Hydrochloric acid is used to clean swimming pools, bricks, and concrete.
Sulfuric acid:
Sulfuric Acid is an important component of car batteries.
Acids are ionic compounds that produce positive hydrogen ions (H + ) when dissolved in water.
Acids taste sour, conduct electricity when dissolved in water, and react with metals to produce hydrogen gas.
Certain indicator compounds, such as litmus, can be used to detect acids.
