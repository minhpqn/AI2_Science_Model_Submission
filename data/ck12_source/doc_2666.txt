This makes metals good conductors of electricity.
The lattice-like structure of metal ions is strong but quite flexible.
This allows metals to bend without breaking.
Metals are both ductile (can be shaped into wires) and malleable (can be shaped into thin sheets).

Q:
Look at the metalworker in the Figure below .
He’s hammering a piece of hot iron in order to shape it.
Why doesn’t the iron crack when he hits it?
A:
The iron ions can move within the “sea” of electrons around them.
They can shift a little closer together or farther apart without breaking the metallic bonds between them.
Therefore, the metal can bend rather than crack when the hammer hits it.

Metallic bonds are the force of attraction between positive metal ions and the valence electrons that are constantly moving around them.
The ions form a lattice-like structure held together by the metallic bonds.
Metallic bonds explain why metals can conduct electricity and bend without breaking.
