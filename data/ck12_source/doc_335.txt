Light-skinned people, like the man pictured below ( Figure below ), get sunburned more quickly than people with darker skin.
This is because pigments (melanin) in the skin act as a natural sunblock that help to protect the body from UV radiation.
With over one million new cases each year, skin cancer, which is cancer that forms in the tissues of the skin, is the most common form of human cancer.
Children and teens who have been sunburned are at a greater risk of developing skin cancer later in life.
Long-term exposure to UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer.
About 90 percent of skin cancers are linked to sun exposure.
UV radiation damages the genetic material (DNA) of skin cells.
This damage can cause the skin cells to grow out of control and form a tumor.
Some of these tumors are very difficult to cure.
For this reason you should always wear sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), a hat, and clothing when out in the sun.
Sunburn is caused by an overexposure to UV rays, and can increase the risk of skin cancer
Sunburn is caused by overexposure to UV rays.
Getting sunburned as a child or a teen, especially sunburn that causes blistering, increases the risk of developing skin cancer later in life.
Keeping your skin clean is important because dirty skin is more prone to infection.
Bathing every day helps to keep your skin clean and healthy.
Also, you know that taking a bath or shower helps prevent body odor.
But where does body odor come from?
During the day, sweat, oil, dirt, dust, and dead skin cells can build up on the skin surface.
If not washed away, the mix of these materials can encourage the excess growth of bacteria.
These bacteria feed on these substances and cause a smell that is commonly called body odor.
