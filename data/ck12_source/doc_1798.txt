It is made of just two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.
Water is remarkable in terms of all the things it can do.
Lots of things dissolve easily in water.
Some types of rock can even completely dissolve in water ( Figure below )!
Other minerals change by adding water into their structure.
Hydrolysis is the name of the chemical reaction between a compound and water.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) combines with water as raindrops fall through the air.
This makes a weak acid, called carbonic acid.
This happens so often that carbonic acid is a common, weak acid found in nature.
This acid works to dissolve rock.
It eats away at sculptures and monuments.
While this is normal, more acids are made when we add pollutants to the air.
Any time we burn any fossil fuel, it adds nitrous oxide to the air.
When we burn coal, rich in sulfur, it adds sulfur dioxide to the air.
As nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide react with water, they form nitric acid and sulfuric acid.
These are the two main components of acid rain.
Acid rain accelerates chemical weathering.
Oxygen strongly reacts with elements at the Earthâ€™s surface.
