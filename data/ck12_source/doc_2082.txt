How Coal Forms
Coal forms from dead plants that settled at the bottom of swamps millions of years ago ( Figure below ).
Water and mud in the swamp kept oxygen away from the plant material.
Sand and clay settled on top of the decaying plants.
The weight of this material squeezed out the water and some other substances.
Over time, the organic material became a carbon-rich rock.
This rock is coal.

Coal has different grades.
Bituminous coal forms at lower temperatures.
It contains a lot of sulfur.
When it is burned, it causes a lot of pollution.
Anthracite coal forms under higher temperatures.
This drives off the sulfur, and the coal burns more cleanly.
What Coal Is
Coal is a black or brownish-black rock that burns easily ( Figure below ).
Most coal is sedimentary rock.
The hardest type of coal, anthracite, is a metamorphic rock.
That is because it is exposed to higher temperature and pressure as it forms.
