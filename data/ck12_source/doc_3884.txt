Give examples of adaptations organisms have due to climate.
What do temperature, wind and rain have in common?
They are all part of climate, the statistical summary of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, other meteorological measurements in a given region over long periods.
In other words, is it dry or wet, hot or cold, or humid?
And it is these abiotic factors that help determine the nature of a biome.
If you look at the two pictures in Figure below , you will see very few similarities.
The picture on the left shows a desert in Africa.
The picture on the right shows a rainforest in Australia.
The desert doesnâ€™t have any visible plants, whereas the rainforest is densely packed with trees.
What explains these differences?
A desert and a rainforest are different biomes, even though both are roughly at the same distance from the equator
Sahara Desert in northern Africa (left).
Rainforest in northeastern Australia (right).
Two very different biomes are pictured here.
A biome is a group of similar ecosystems with the same general abiotic factors and primary producers.
Both are found at roughly the same distance from the equator.
Terrestrial biomes include all the land areas on Earth where organisms live.
The distinguishing features of terrestrial biomes are determined mainly by climate.
Terrestrial biomes include tundras, temperate forests and grasslands, chaparral, temperate and tropical deserts, and tropical forests and grasslands.
