Do you know of other examples of each type of mutagen shown here?
There are five common types of spontaneous mutations.
These are described in the Table below .
a base is changed by the repositioning of a hydrogen atom
loss of a purine base (A or G)
spontaneous deamination of 5-methycytosine
a purine to purine (A to G, G to A), or a pyrimidine to pyrimidine (C to T, T to C) change
a purine becomes a pyrimidine, or vice versa
The Chernobyl Disaster:
Follow-up
Though the area immediately around the Chernobyl disaster may not be safe for human life for thousands of years, the Exclusion Zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power station has become a haven for wildlife.
As humans were evacuated from the area 25 years ago, existing animal populations multiplied and rare species not seen for centuries have returned or have been reintroduced, for example lynx, wild boar, wolf, Eurasian brown bear, European bison, Przewalski's horse, and eagle owl.
Birds nest inside the cracked concrete sarcophagus shielding in the shattered remains of the nuclear reactor.
The Exclusion Zone is so lush with wildlife and greenery that in 2007 the Ukrainian government designated it a wildlife sanctuary.
It is now one of the largest wildlife sanctuaries in Europe.
Mutations are caused by environmental factors known as mutagens.
Types of mutagens include radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents.
Mutations may be spontaneous in nature.
