Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena, not just why helium balloons rise.
For example, differences in density of cool and warm ocean water explain why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans.

To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and volleyball, pictured in the Figure below .
Imagine lifting each ball.
The two balls are about the same size, but the bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball.
Thatâ€™s because the bowling ball is made of solid plastic, which contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter.
The volleyball, in contrast, is full of air, which contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter.
In other words, the matter inside the bowling ball is denser than the matter inside the volleyball.
A bowling ball is denser than a volleyball
A bowling ball is denser than a volleyball.
Although both balls are similar in size, the bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball.
Q:
If you ever went bowling, you may have noticed that some bowling balls feel heavier than others even though they are the same size.
How can this be?
A:
Bowling balls that feel lighter are made of matter that is less dense.
The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space.
The amount of matter is measured by its mass, and the space matter takes up is measured by its volume.
