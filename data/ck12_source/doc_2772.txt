They “eat” insects just to get extra nutrients.
Food from Light
Most of the energy used by living things comes either directly or indirectly from the sun.
That’s because sunlight provides the energy for photosynthesis.
This is the process in which plants and certain other organisms synthesize glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ).
The process uses carbon dioxide and water and also produces oxygen.
The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Light Energy → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2
Photosynthesis changes light energy to chemical energy.
The chemical energy is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules.
Glucose, in turn, is used for energy by the cells of almost all living things.
Photosynthetic organisms such as plants make their own glucose.
Other organisms get glucose by consuming plants (or organisms that consume plants).
Q:
How do living things get energy from glucose?
A:
They break bonds in glucose and release the stored energy in the process of cellular respiration.
The organisms pictured in the Figures below , below , and below all use sunlight to make glucose in the process of photosynthesis.
In addition to plants, they include bacteria and algae.
All of these organisms contain the green pigment chlorophyll, which is needed to capture light energy.
