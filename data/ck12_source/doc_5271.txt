The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process.
England's Queen Victoria was a carrier for this disease.
The allele was passed to two of her daughters and one son.
Since royal families in Europe commonly intermarried, the allele spread, and may have contributed to the downfall of the Russian monarchy.
See Mendelian laws apply to human beings at for more on hemophilia and the royal family.
Hemophilia B is another type of hemophilia, caused by a mutation in the F9 gene, resulting in an abnormal Factor IX protein.
This protein is normally also involved in the coagulation cascade.
Hemophilia B is also caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the defective gene located on the X chromosome.

Von Willebrand disease is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder.
Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which helps blood platelets clump together and stick to the blood vessel wall.
This is necessary for normal blood clotting.

Genetics of hemophilia, A and B
Hemophilia is a sex-linked trait.
Carrier mothers can pass along the affected allele to 50% of their sons.
Females with hemophilia would have to receive an affected allele from each parent, making females with hemophilia rare.
Genetic red-green color blindness affects men much more often than women, because the genes for the red and green color receptors are located on the X chromosome.
Females are red-green color blind only if both of their X chromosomes carry the defective gene, whereas males are color blind if their single X chromosome carries the defective gene.
As males have only the one X-chromosome, the gene for red-green color blindness is transmitted from a color blind male to all his daughters, who are usually heterozygous carriers and therefore unaffected.
