An organelle is a structure within the cytoplasm that performs a specific job in the cell.
Organelles called mitochondria, for example, provide energy to the cell, and organelles called vacuoles store substances in the cell.
Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to carry out more functions than prokaryotic cells can.
This allows eukaryotic cells to have greater cell specificity than prokaryotic cells.
Ribosomes, the organelle where proteins are made, are the only organelles in prokaryotic cells.

What similarities and differences do you see?
In some ways, a cell resembles a plastic bag full of Jell-O.
Its basic structure is a plasma membrane filled with cytoplasm.
Like Jell-O containing mixed fruit, the cytoplasm of the cell also contains various structures, such as a nucleus and other organelles.

Prokaryotic cells are cells without a nucleus.
Eukaryotic cells are cells that contain a nucleus.
Eukaryotic cells have other organelles besides the nucleus.
The only organelles in a prokaryotic cell are ribosomes.
