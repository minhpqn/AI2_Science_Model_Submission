Researchers are beginning to look at how to individualize medical treatments, based on our genetic profiles.
Some of the biggest breakthroughs have been in cancer treatment.

Personalized medicine is a drug treatment regimen individually developed to an individual based on that person's genetic profile.
Genetic Testing and Prenatal Diagnosis
Let's propose a hypothetical situation: unfortunately, members of your family are predisposed to develop a debilitating genetic disease.
You and your spouse want to have a baby, but you want to know the likelihood of the child developing the disease.
This scenario could happen to anyone.
As we learn more and more about disease causing genes, it will become easier to test for mutations in those genes.
Currently, is there any way to determine if a baby will develop a disease due to a known mutation?
Is it possible to screen for a mutation in a developing baby?
The answer to both those questions is…yes.
Genetic testing involves the direct examination of DNA sequences.
A scientist scans, by any number of methods, a patient’s DNA for mutated sequences.
Genetic testing can be used to:
Diagnose a disease.
Confirm a diagnosis.
Provide information about the course of a disease.
Confirm the existence of a disease.
