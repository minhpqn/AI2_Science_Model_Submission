Consider a gigantic tub filled with water as shown below.
A column of water with a cross-sectional area of 1.00 m 2 is designated.
If we multiply the cross-sectional area by the height of the column, we get the volume of water in this column.
We can then multiply this volume by the density of water, 1000. kg/m 3 , and get the mass of water in the column.
We then multiply this mass by the acceleration due to gravity,  g , to get the weight of the water in this column.
Volume of water in a column
The pressure exerted by this force would be exerted over the area at the bottom of the column.
P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\rho gh A}{A}=\rho g h
Therefore, the pressure of a column of fluid is proportional to the density of the fluid and to the height of the column of fluid above the level.
This is the pressure due to the fluid itself.
If an external pressure is exerted at the surface, this must also be taken into account.
Example Problem:
The surface of the water in a storage tank is 30.0 m above a water faucet in the kitchen of a house.
Calculate the water pressure at the faucet.
Solution:
The pressure of the atmosphere acts equally at the surface of the water in the storage tank and on the water leaving the faucet – so it will have no effect.
The pressure caused by the column of water will be:
P=\rho gh=(1000.\ kg/m^3)(9.80 \ m/s^2)(30.0 \ m)=294, 000 \ Pa
The pressure of the earth’s atmosphere, as with any fluid, increases with the height of the column of air.
In the case of earth’s atmosphere, there are some complications.
