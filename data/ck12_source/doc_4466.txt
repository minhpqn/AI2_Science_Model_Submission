For example, the virus called hepatitis B causes liver cancer.
UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer.
The radioactive gas known as radon causes lung cancer.
Tobacco smoke contains dozens of carcinogens, including nicotine and formaldehyde.
Exposure to tobacco smoke is the leading cause of lung cancer.
Some chemicals that were previously added to foods, such as certain dyes, are now known to cause cancer.
Cooking foods at very high temperatures also causes carcinogens to form (see Figure below ).
Barbecued foods are cooked at very high temperatures.
This may cause carcinogens to form.
How Cancer Occurs
Mutations that lead to cancer usually occur in genes that control the cell cycle.
These include tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes.
Tumor-suppressor genes normally prevent cells with damaged DNA from dividing.
Mutations in these genes prevent them from functioning normally.
As a result, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide.
Proto-oncogenes normally help control cell division.
Mutations in these genes turn them into oncogenes.
Oncogenes promote the division of cells with damaged DNA.
Cells that divide uncontrollably may form a tumor , or abnormal mass of cells.
Tumors may be benign or malignant.
