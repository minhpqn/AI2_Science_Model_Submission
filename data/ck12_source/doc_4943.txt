The water from inside the potato moves out of the potato cells to the salt solution, which causes the potato cells to lose turgor pressure.
The more concentrated the salt solution, the greater the difference in the size and weight of the potato slice after plasmolysis.
The action of osmosis can be very harmful to organisms, especially ones without cell walls.
For example, if a saltwater fish (whose cells are isotonic with seawater), is placed in fresh water, its cells will take on excess water, lyse, and the fish will die.
Another example of a harmful osmotic effect is the use of table salt to kill slugs and snails.

Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as freshwater, need a way to prevent their cells from taking in too much water by osmosis.
A contractile vacuole is a type of vacuole that removes excess water from a cell.
Freshwater protists, such as the paramecia shown in Figure below , have a contractile vacuole.
The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm.
After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole.
When the vacuole is full, it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore.
Other protists, such as members of the genus Amoeba , have contractile vacuoles that move to the surface of the cell when full and release the water into the environment.

In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with the higher solute concentration.
