Homeostasis and Cell Function
Homeostasis refers to the balance, or equilibrium within the cell or a body.
It is an organismâ€™s ability to keep a constant internal environment.
Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell.
The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation.
Because the internal and external environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments must be made continuously to stay at or near the set point (the normal level or range).
Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium rather than an unchanging state.
The cellular processes discussed in this lesson all play an important role in homeostatic regulation.
More concerning homeostasis will be presented in additional concepts.
clathrin :
A protein that plays a major role in the formation of coated vesicles.
clathrin-dependent endocytosis :
Endocytosis in which the inward budding of plasma membrane vesicles containing proteins with receptor sites specific to the molecules being internalized; also known as receptor-mediated endocytosis.
endocytosis :
The cellular process of capturing a material/substance from outside the cell by vesicle formation.
exocytosis :
The cellular process of secreting materials by vesicle fusion.
