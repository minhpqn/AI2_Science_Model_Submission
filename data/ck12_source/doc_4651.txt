The fetus could not grow and develop without oxygen and nutrients from the mother.
Wastes from the fetus must also be removed in order for it to survive.
The exchange of these substances between the mother and fetus occurs through the placenta.
The placenta is a temporary organ that begins to form from the trophoblast layer of cells shortly after implantation .
The placenta continues to develop and grow to meet the needs of the growing fetus.
A fully developed placenta is made up of a large mass of blood vessels from both the mother and fetus.
The maternal and fetal vessels are close together but separated by tiny spaces.
This allows the mother’s and fetus’s blood to exchange substances across their capillary walls without the blood actually mixing.
See The Placenta and the Fetus:

for additional information.
The fetus is connected to the placenta through the umbilical cord , a tube that contains two arteries and a vein.
Blood from the fetus enters the placenta through the umbilical arteries, exchanges gases and other substances with the mother’s blood, and travels back to the fetus through the umbilical vein.

Notice the fetus is attached to the placenta by the umbilical cord, made of two arteries and one vein.
Amniotic Sac and Fluid
Attached to the placenta is the amniotic sac , an enclosed membrane that surrounds and protects the fetus.
It contains amniotic fluid , which consists of water and dissolved substances.
The fluid allows the fetus to move freely until it grows to fill most of the available space.
