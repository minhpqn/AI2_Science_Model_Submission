If we were to increase the speed at which we rotate our hand, we increase the velocity of the yo-yo - it is spinning faster.
As it spins faster, it also changes direction faster.
The acceleration increases.
Now let's think about the bottom of the equation: the radius.
If we halve the length of the yo-yo string (bring the yo-yo closer to us), we make the yo-yo's velocity greater.
Again, it moves faster, which increases the acceleration.
If we make the string longer again, this decreases the acceleration.
We now understand why the relationship between the radius and the acceleration is an inverse relationship - as we decrease the radius, the acceleration increases, and visa versa.
Vectors of acceleration and velocity are perpendicular in uniform circular motion
Example Problem:
A ball at the end of a string is swinging in a horizontal circle of radius 1.15 m.
The ball makes exactly 2.00 revolutions per second.
What is its centripetal acceleration?
Solution:
We first determine the velocity of the ball using the facts that the circumference of the circle is  2 \pi r and the ball goes around exactly twice per second.
v=\frac{(2)(2 \pi r)}{t}=\frac{(2)(2)(3.14)(1.15 \ \text{m})}{1.00 \ \text{s}}=14.4 \ \text{m/s}
We then use the velocity and radius in the centripetal acceleration equation.
a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{(14.4 \ \text{m/s})^2}{1.15 \ \text{m}}=180. \ \text{m/s}^2
Example Problem:
The moon's nearly circular orbit around the earth has a radius of about 385,000 km and a period of 27.3 days.
