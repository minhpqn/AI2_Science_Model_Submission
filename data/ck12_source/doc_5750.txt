Metalloids that can conduct electricity at higher temperatures are called semiconductors.
Silicon is an example of a semiconductor.
It is used to make the tiny electric circuits in computer chips.
You can see a sample of silicon and a silicon chip in the Figure below .

Metalloids tend to be shiny like metals but brittle like nonmetals.
Because they are brittle, they may chip like glass or crumble to a powder if struck.
Other physical properties of metalloids are more variable, including their boiling and melting points, although all metalloids exist as solids at room temperature.
You can learn about the properties of specific metalloids by watching the video at this URL:

Metalloids are the smallest class of elements, containing just six elements.
They fall between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table.
How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in the outer energy level of their atoms.
Metalloids may act either like metals or nonmetals in chemical reactions.
Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some physical properties of nonmetals.
They fall between metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat and electricity.
They are shiny like metals but brittle like nonmetals.
All exist as solids at room temperature.
Because metalloids are similar in some ways to metals and in other ways to nonmetals, to understand metalloids you need to know about these other two classes of elements.
Watch the following video on classes of elements.
