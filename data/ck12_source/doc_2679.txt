Baking a cake is an irreversible reaction
Combustion reactions are generally irreversible.
Combustion occurs whenever a fuel burns.
In this type of reaction, the fuel may combine with oxygen (in the air) and produces carbon dioxide and water vapor.
The chemical equation for a combustion reaction is:
Fuel + O 2 â†’ CO 2 + H 2 O
In a complete combustion reaction, fuel and oxygen are the reactants and the products are carbon dioxide and water.
These two products cannot react to reform the fuel and oxygen, so the reaction is irreversible.
The one-way arrow in the equation shows that the reaction can go in only one direction.
Many chemical reactions can occur in both directions.
These reactions are called reversible reactions.
Not only can the reactants change to the products, but the products can change back to the reactants, at least under certain conditions.
Consider again the reaction in which hydrogen gas and oxygen gas combine to produce water.
This reaction is reversible if an electric current is applied to the water that is produced.
You can see how this is done in the Figure below .
The current causes the water molecules to break down to individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
Then these atoms recombine to form molecules of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.

Q:
In a chemical equation, a reversible reaction is represented with two arrows, one pointing in each direction.
