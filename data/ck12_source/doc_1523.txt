Since warmer molecules have more energy, they are more active.
The molecules bounce off each other and spread apart.
Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude.
Altitude and Density
Altitude is height above sea level.
The density of air decreases with height.
There are two reasons: at higher altitudes, there is less air pushing down from above, and gravity is weaker farther from Earth's center.
So at higher altitudes, air molecules can spread out more, and air density decreases ( Figure below ).

This drawing represents a column of air.
The column rises from sea level to the top of the atmosphere.
Where does air have the greatest density?
Because air is a gas, its molecules have a lot of energy.
Air molecules move a lot and bump into things.
For this reason, they exert pressure.
Air pressure is defined as the weight of the air pressing against a given area.
At sea level, the atmosphere presses down with a force of about 1 kilogram per square centimeter (14.76 pounds per square inch).
If you are standing at sea level, you have more than a ton of air pressing against you.
Why doesnâ€™t the pressure crush you?
Air presses in all directions at once.
