What is a cell?
It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit necessary for life.
But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life.
And as shown above, a cell may be filled with all sorts of structures, each with its own specific function.
This concept will discuss some of the fundamental properties of the cell, with lessons that include the cell structure, transport in and out of the cell, energy metabolism, and cell division and reproduction.
Explain how cells are observed.
Define cell.
Describe the general role of a cell.
State the three main parts of the cell theory.
Summarize the structure-function relationship of a cell.
Explain the levels of organization in an organism.
What are you made of?
Cells make up all living things, including your own body.
This picture shows a typical group of cells.
But not all cells look alike.
Cells can differ in shape and sizes.
And the different shapes usually means different functions.
Introduction to Cells
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism.
Some organisms, like bacteria, consist of only one cell.
