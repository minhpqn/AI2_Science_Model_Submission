Classification of bacteria: gram positive and gram negative
Classification of Bacteria.
Different types of bacteria stain a different color when stained with Gram stain.
This makes them easy to identify.
Scientists still know relatively little about Archaea.
This is partly because they are hard to grow in the lab.
Many live inside the bodies of animals, including humans.
However, none are known for certain to cause disease.
Archaea were first discovered in extreme environments.
For example, some were found in hot springs.
Others were found around deep sea vents.
Such Archaea are called extremophiles , or “lovers of extremes.” Figure below describes three different types of Archaean extremophiles.
The places where some of them live are thought to be similar to the environment on ancient Earth.
This suggests that they may have evolved very early in Earth’s history.
Archaea are specialized to live in extreme environments
Extremophile Archaea.
Many Archaea are specialized to live in extreme environments.
Just three types are described here.
Archaea are now known to live just about everywhere on Earth.
They are particularly numerous in the ocean.
