The pressure of the hydrogen is found by subtraction.
Then, the volume of the gas at STP can be calculated by using the combined gas law.
Step 2:
Solve.
P_{H_2}=P_{\text{Total}}-P_{H_2 O}=739.7 \text{ mmHg} -17.54 \text{ mmHg}=722.2 \text{ mmHg}
Now the combined gas law is used, solving for V_2 , the volume of hydrogen at STP.
V_2=\frac{P_1 \times V_1 \times T_2}{P_2 \times T_1}=\frac{722.2 \text{ mmHg} \times 2.58 \text{ L} \times 273 \text{ K}}{760 \text{ mmHg} \times 293 \text{ K}}=2.28 \text{ L } H_2
Step 3:
Think about your result.
If the hydrogen gas were to be collected at STP and without the presence of the water vapor, its volume would be 2.28 L.
This is less than the actual collected volume because some of that is water vapor.
The conversion using STP is useful for stoichiometry purposes.
The vapor pressure due to water in a sample can be corrected for in order to get the true value for the pressure of the gas.
