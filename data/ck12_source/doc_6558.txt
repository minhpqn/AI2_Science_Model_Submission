Can you resist the smell of a fresh baked cinnamon bun?
There’s nothing like the smell of a fresh cinnamon roll.
The taste is even better.
But what causes that delicious taste?
This flavoring comes from the bark of a tree (actually, several different kinds of trees).
One of the major compounds responsible for the taste and odor of cinnamon is cinnamaldehyde.
Cinnamon has been widely used throughout the centuries to treat a number of different disorders.
In ancient times, doctors believed it could cure snakebite poisoning, freckles, and the common cold.
Today there are several research studies being carried out on the health benefits of cinnamon.
So, enjoy that cinnamon roll – it just might be good for you.
Aldehydes and Ketones
Aldehydes and ketones are two related categories of organic compounds that both contain the carbonyl group , shown below.
Structure of a carbonyl
The difference between aldehydes and ketones is the placement of the carbonyl group within the molecule.
An aldehyde is an organic compound in which the carbonyl group is attached to a carbon atom at the end of a carbon chain.
A ketone is an organic compound in which the carbonyl group is attached to a carbon atom within the carbon chain.
The general formulas for each are shown below.
Structure of aldehydes and ketones
For aldehydes, the R group may be a hydrogen atom or any length carbon chain.
Aldehydes are named by finding the longest continuous chain that contains the carbonyl group.
