In a hypertonic solution, a cell with a cell wall will lose water too.
The plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall as it shrivels, a process called plasmolysis .
Animal cells tend to do best in an isotonic environment, plant cells tend to do best in a hypotonic environment.
This is demonstrated in Figure below .
illustrates how animal and plant cells change in different solution types
Unless an animal cell (such as the red blood cell in the top panel) has an adaptation that allows it to alter the osmotic uptake of water, it will lose too much water and shrivel up in a hypertonic environment.
If placed in a hypotonic solution, water molecules will enter the cell, causing it to swell and burst.
Plant cells (bottom panel) become plasmolyzed in a hypertonic solution, but tend to do best in a hypotonic environment.
Water is stored in the central vacuole of the plant cell.
When water moves into a cell by osmosis, osmotic pressure may build up inside the cell.
If a cell has a cell wall, the wall helps maintain the cellâ€™s water balance.
Osmotic pressure is the main cause of support in many plants.
When a plant cell is in a hypotonic environment, the osmotic entry of water raises the turgor pressure exerted against the cell wall until the pressure prevents more water from coming into the cell.
At this point the plant cell is turgid ( Figure below ).
The effects of osmotic pressures on plant cells are shown in Figure below .
A photo of turgid plant cells
The central vacuoles of the plant cells in this image are full of water, so the cells are turgid.
The action of osmosis can be very harmful to organisms, especially ones without cell walls.
For example, if a saltwater fish (whose cells are isotonic with seawater), is placed in fresh water, its cells will take on excess water, lyse, and the fish will die.
Another example of a harmful osmotic effect is the use of table salt to kill slugs and snails.
