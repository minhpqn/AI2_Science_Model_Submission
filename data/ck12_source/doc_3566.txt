Where do the hydrogen ions (H + ) come from that help make ATP?
Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle specific to plant cells.
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast.
Electron carrier molecules are arranged in electron transport chains that produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical energy.
