After passing into the eye through the pupil, light passes through the lens.
The lens of the eye is a clear, curved structure.
Along with the cornea, the lens helps focus light at the back of the eye.
This is pictured below ( Figure below ).
The lens must bend light from nearby objects more than it bends light from far-away objects.
The lens changes shape to bend the light by just the right amount to bring objects into focus.
The lens focuses light on the retina , which covers the back of the inside of the eye.
The retina has light-sensing photoreceptor cells called rods and cones.
Rods let us see in dim light.
Cones let us detect light of different colors.
When light hits rods and cones, it causes chemical changes.
The chemical changes start nerve impulses.
The nerve impulses travel to the brain through the optic nerve .
The brain makes sense of the nerve impulses and tells you what you are seeing.
The lens focuses light onto the back of the eye
Light from objects at different distances is focused by the lens of the eye.
Muscles in the eye control the shape of the lens so the light is focused on the back of the eye no matter how far the object is from the lens.
Light entering the eye is focused by the lens on the retina, which sends messages to the brain through the optic nerve.
Muscles in the eye control the shape of the lens so the light is focused on the back of the eye no matter how far the object is from the lens.
