The Physics of Skydiving
When you fall thousands of feet from the sky, it seems like something strange is happening with the laws of physics.
Turns out, everything relies on a simple force called drag.
Though it may seem skydivers are in free fall, air resistance allows skydivers to speed up, slow down, and even change direction.

Friction is caused by bodies sliding over rough surfaces.
The degree of surface roughness is indicated by the coefficient of friction, \mu .
The force of friction is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of friction by the normal force.
The frictional force always opposes motion.
The net force is found by subtracting the frictional force from the applied force.
Use this resource to answer the following questions about friction:
