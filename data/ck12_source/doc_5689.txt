In other words, every wavelength of light could possibly be emitted.
Instead, what Planck found by analyzing the spectra was that the energy of the hot body could only be lost in small discrete units.
A quantum is the minimum quantity of energy that can either be lost or gained by an atom.
An analogy is that a brick wall can only undergo a change in height by units of one or more bricks and not by any possible height.
Planck showed that the amount of radiant energy absorbed or emitted by an object is directly proportional to the frequency of the radiation.
In the equation,  E is the energy, in joules, of a quantum of radiation,  v is the frequency, and  h is a fundamental constant called Planck’s constant .
The value of Planck’s constant is h=6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ \text{J} \cdot \text{s} .
The energy of any system must increase or decrease in units of h \times v .
A small energy change results in the emission or absorption of low-frequency radiation, while a large energy change results in the emission or absorption of high-frequency radiation.
Sample Problem:
Quantized Energy
What is the energy of a photon of green light with a frequency of 5.75 × 10 14 Hz?
Step 1:
List the known quantities and plan the problem.
frequency  (\nu) = 5.75 × 10 14 Hz
Planck's constant  (h) = 6.626 × 10 -34 J • s
Apply the equation E=hv to solve for the energy.
Step 2:
Calculate
E=(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ \text{J} \cdot \text{s}) \times (5.75 \times 10^{14} \ \text{Hz})=3.81 \times 10^{-19} \ \text{J}
