Not all colors of light are used in photosynthesis (solid line).
Most plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria appear green because they reflect green wavelengths.
Their pigments have absorbed the violet-blue and red wavelengths.
The amount of photosynthesis depends on the wavelength of light available.
Beta-carotene is another type of pigment that absorbs sunlight.
The pigment molecule chlorophyll of leaf cells appears green because its electrons absorb blue-violet and red light and reflect green, orange, and yellow light.
There are actually several different kinds of chlorophyll (a,b, and d) in plants.
Each kind of pigment absorbs specific wavelengths (colors) of light.
Sunlight contains many different wavelengths, which you see when they separate into a rainbow.

Cartenoids are also pigments that absorb sunlight.
When light strikes chlorophyll (or an accessory pigment) within the chloroplast, the energy is absorbed and transferred to electrons in the chlorophyll.
Essentially, sunlight energizes or "excites," electrons within the chlorophyll molecule.
Photosystem II is also known as P680, with P standing for pigment and 680 referring to the absorption maximum in the red part of the visible spectrum (680 nm).
The primary electron donor in P680 receives excitation energy by absorbing a photon of light.
These excited electrons jump up to higher energy levels and enter the electron transport chain ; they have absorbed or captured, and now carry, that energy.
These high energy electrons are holding the energy that will be be transferred to glucose.
