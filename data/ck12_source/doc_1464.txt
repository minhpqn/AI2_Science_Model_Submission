Cleaning groundwater is especially difficult.
If you want to drink clean water, groundwater must not become polluted.

Irrigation water can bring pesticides and other chemicals.
Water can seep through landfills.
Tanks of gasoline stored underground can leak.
Pollutants can be filtered out of water that travels through rock and soil.
Filtering is very effective, but it doesn't get out all of the pollutants.
Pollutants that enter an aquifer spread outward from the source.
They spread in the direction the water is moving.
It is a lot easier and cheaper not to pollute surface water than it is to clean it.
