Identify state of matter as a physical property of matter.
Contrast the three states of matter that are most common on Earth.
The striking blue walls in this photo are actually the sheer ice walls of a massive glacier.
The glacier in the picture is in Argentina, and the bluish water in the foreground is Lake Argentina.
The photo represents an important concept in physical science.
Can you guess what it is?
Water, Water Everywhere
The photo above represents water in three common states of matter.
States of matter are different phases in which any given type of matter can exist.
There are actually four well-known states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Plasma isn’t represented in the iceberg photo, but the other three states of matter are.
The iceberg itself consists of water in the solid state, and the lake consists of water in the liquid state.
Q:
Where is water in the gaseous state in the above photo?
A:
You can’t see the gaseous water, but it’s there.
It exists as water vapor in the air.
Q:
Water is one of the few substances that commonly exist on Earth in more than one state.
Many other substances typically exist only in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state.
