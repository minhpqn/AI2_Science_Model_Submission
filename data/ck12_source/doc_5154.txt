The mitosis checkpoint determines the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next.
This checkpoint occurs at the point in metaphase where all the chromosomes should have aligned at the metaphase plate.
This checkpoint signals the beginning of anaphase, allowing the cell to complete mitosis and prepare for the beginning of G 1 of the next cell cycle.
The DNA synthesis (S) checkpoint determines if the cell is ready for mitosis.
DNA repair enzymes check the replicated DNA at this point.
If the checkpoint is passed, the many molecular mechanisms and processes needed for mitosis will begin.
Checkpoints in the eukaryotic cell cycle ensure that the cell is ready to proceed before it moves on to the next phase of the cycle.
In this diagram the G 1 , S, and M checkpoints are shown.
G 0 phase
1 st growth phase
2 nd growth phase
The G 1 checkpoint ensures that the cell has completed its homeostatic functions and is ready for DNA synthesis.
The S phase checkpoint ensures that DNA replication is complete.
The G 2 checkpoint ensures that the cell is ready to enter the M (mitosis) phase and divide.
A checkpoint in the middle of mitosis (at metaphase) ensures that the cell is ready to complete cell division.
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) :
A family of protein kinases discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle; also involved in regulating transcription, mRNA processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells.
cyclins :
A family of proteins that control the progression of cells through the cell cycle; activates cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) enzymes.
feedback regulation :
