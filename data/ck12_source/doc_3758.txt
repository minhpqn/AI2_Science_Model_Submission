Do dinosaurs prove evolution?
For millions of years dinosaurs roamed and dominated the planet.
Then 65 million years ago, they went extinct.
In fact, over 90% of species that have lived are now extinct.
The change in species over time is evolution, the focus of the lessons in the Evolution chapter.
History of Life
Describe the fossil record.
Compare relative dating to absolute dating.
Describe the role of molecular clocks.
Summarize the geologic time scale.
How do we learn about the past?
We study the remains of things that existed many years ago.
The Ruins of Pompeii have given archeologists, historians, and other scholars a tremendous amount of information about life two thousand years ago.
This section discusses studying things that are many thousands of years older than these remains.
Earth in a Day
It’s hard to grasp the vast amounts of time since Earth formed and life first appeared on its surface.
It may help to think of Earth’s history as a 24-hour day, as shown in Figure below .
Humans would have appeared only during the last minute of that day.
If we are such newcomers on planet Earth, how do we know about the vast period of time that went before us?
How have we learned about the distant past?
