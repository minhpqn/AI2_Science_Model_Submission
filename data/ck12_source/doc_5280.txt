The analysis and screening for Tay-Sachs has became a research and public health model for understanding and preventing all autosomal genetic disorders.
Another genetic disease that is easily analyzed is phenylketonuria.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine.
PKU is due to a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).
When PAH is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylketones, which can be detected in the urine.
Left untreated, this condition can cause problems with brain development, leading to progressive mental retardation and seizures.
However, PKU can be treated with a specific diet, one low in phenylalanine.
A diet low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine can bring about a nearly total cure.
The incidence of PKU is about 1 in 15,000 live births.
In the United States PKU is screened at birth as part of a national biochemical screening program, for every baby born in a hospital.
Babies born at home may not be screened.
If PKU is diagnosed early enough, an affected newborn can grow up with normal brain development, but only by eating a special diet low in phenylalanine for the rest of his or her life.
In essence, this is a protein-free diet.
This requires severely restricting or eliminating foods high in protein content (containing phenylalanine), such as breast milk, meat, chicken, fish, nuts, cheese and other dairy products.
Starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, pasta, and corn must also be monitored.
