Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand extreme water pressure, very cold water, and complete darkness.
However, even here, thriving communities of living things can be found.
Organisms cluster around hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor.
The vents release hot water containing chemicals that would be toxic to most other living things.
The producers among them are single-celled chemoautotrophs.
They make food using energy stored in the chemicals.
Monitoring Marine Protected Areas
Is overfishing an important issue?
What would happen if fish populations dwindled?
Marine Protected Areas are no-fishing zones that have recently been established up and down the California coast, in the hope of allowing fish to breed, grow large, and replenish state waters.
Scientists monitor these areas to determine if this process is working.
