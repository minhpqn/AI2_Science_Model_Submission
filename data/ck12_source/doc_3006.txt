If you understand how a skateboard starts and stops, then you already know something about Newton’s first law of motion .
This law was developed by English scientist Isaac Newton around 1700.
Newton was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He developed three laws of motion and the law of gravity, among many other contributions.
Newton’s first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.
Without an unbalanced force, a moving object will not only keep moving, but its speed and direction will also remain the same.
Newton’s first law of motion is often called the law of inertia because inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion.
If an object is already at rest, inertia will keep it at rest.
If an object is already in motion, inertia will keep it moving.

Q :
How does Nina use Newton’s first law to start her skateboard rolling?
A :
The skateboard won’t move unless Nina pushes off from the pavement with one foot.
The force she applies when she pushes off is stronger than the force of friction that opposes the skateboard’s motion.
As a result, the force on the skateboard is unbalanced, and the skateboard moves forward.
Q :
How does Nina use Newton’s first law to stop her skateboard?
A :
Once the skateboard starts moving, it would keep moving at the same speed and in the same direction if not for another unbalanced force.
