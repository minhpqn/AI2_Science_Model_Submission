When they order a pizza (either by phone, on-line, or in a restaurant), they don’t just order “pizza.” Even the simplest “binary” pizza will have a topping and cheese – maybe pepperoni, maybe something else.
However, many pizzas quickly become more complex.
One person may want pepperoni and sausage, another may wish to order Canadian bacon and pineapple, and then you have the folks that can’t decide, so they order half-this and half-that.
The combinations may be more complex, but the same basic ideas about pizza are valid.
Ternary Ionic Compounds
Not all ionic compounds are composed of only monatomic ions.
A ternary ionic compound is an ionic compound composed of three or more elements.
In a typical ternary ionic compound, there is still one type of cation and one type of anion involved.
The cation, the anion, or both, is a polyatomic ion.
Naming Ternary Ionic Compounds
The process of naming ternary ionic compounds is the same as naming binary ionic compounds.
The cation is named first, followed by the anion.
Some examples are shown in the Table below :
Examples of Ternary Ionic Compounds
NH 4 Cl
When more than one polyatomic ion is present in a compound, the formula of the ion is placed in parentheses with a subscript outside of the parentheses that indicates how many of those ions are in the compound.
In the last example above, there is one Fe 3+ cation and three OH - anions.
Writing Formulas for Ternary Ionic Compounds
Writing a formula for a ternary ionic compound also involves the same steps as for a binary ionic compound.
Write the symbol and charge of the cation followed by the symbol and charge of the anion.
