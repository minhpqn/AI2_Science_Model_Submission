Why do radioisotopes differ in the length of their half-lives?
What fraction of a given amount of hydrogen-3 would be left after 36.9 years of decay? ( Hint :
Find the half-life of hydrogen-3 in the Table above .)
Half-life and Radioactive Dating
Define radioactive dating.
Describe how radioactive dating works.
Explain how carbon-14 dating can be used to date the remains of living things.
The Grand Canyon, pictured above, was carved by the rushing waters of the Colorado River over millions of years.
The exposed rocks at the bottom of the canyon are almost 2 billion years old.
The youngest rocks near the top are about 230 million years old.
Therefore, from top to bottom, the rocks provide a continuous record of more than 1.5 billion years of geological history in this region.
Q:
How have scientists been able to determine the ages of rocks in the Grand Canyon?
A:
The ages are based on the gradual decay, or break down, of radioactive isotopes.
What Is Radioactive Dating?
Radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes, can be used to estimate the ages of not only of rocks, but also of fossils and artifacts made long ago by human beings.
Even the age of Earth has been estimated on the basis of radioisotopes.
The general method is called radioactive dating .
To understand how radioactive dating works, you need to understand radioisotopes and radioactive decay.
