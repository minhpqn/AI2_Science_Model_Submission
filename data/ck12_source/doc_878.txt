Water is actually a limited resource, and for many people, fresh, unpolluted water is hard to find.
A limited resource is one that we use faster than we can remake it.
It is a resource that can be used up.
Water pollution happens when contaminants enter water bodies.
Contaminants are any substances that harm the health of the environment or humans.
Most contaminants enter the water because of humans.
Surface water (river or lake) can be exposed to and contaminated by acid rain, storm water runoff, pesticide runoff, and industrial waste.
This water is cleaned somewhat by exposure to sunlight, aeration, and microorganisms in the water.
Groundwater (private wells and some public water supplies) generally takes longer to become contaminated, but the natural cleaning process also may take much longer.
Groundwater can be contaminated by disease-producing pathogens, careless disposal of hazardous household chemical-containing products, agricultural chemicals, and leaking underground storage tanks.
Water pollution causes detrimental effects to both ecology and human health
Water pollution can cause harmful effects to ecology and human health.
Shown is the pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia.
Natural events, like storms, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can cause major changes in water quality.
But human-caused contaminants have a much greater impact on the quality of the water supply.
Water is considered polluted either when it does not support a human use, like clean drinking water, or a use for other animals and plants.
The overgrowth of algae, known as an algal bloom , can result from the runoff of fertilizer into bodies of water.
This excess of nutrients allows the algae to grow beyond control, bring harm to the rest of the ecosystem.
The main sources of water pollution can be grouped into two categories:
Point source pollution results from the contaminants that enter a waterway or water body through a single site.
