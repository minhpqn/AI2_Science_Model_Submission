A SCUBA diver descends deep into the ocean.
Calculate the water pressure at each of the following depths.
Ouch!
You stepped on my foot!
That is, you put a force of 550 \;\mathrm{N} in an area of 9 \;\mathrm{cm}^2 on the tops of my feet!
What was the pressure on my feet?
What is the ratio of this pressure to atmospheric pressure?
Answers to Selected Problems
a. 83,000 \;\mathrm{Pa} b. 104 \;\mathrm{N} c. 110 \;\mathrm{N}
a. 248 \;\mathrm{kPa} b. 591 \;\mathrm{kPa} c. 1081 \;\mathrm{kPa}
a. 611 \;\mathrm{kPa} b. 6 \;\mathrm{atm}
In these lessons students will learn how the pressure of a fluid is related to depth, how hydraulic press' work and Archemides principle relating buoyancy force to the amount of displaced fluid.
