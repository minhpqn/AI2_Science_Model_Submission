A:
You can tell that they are different compounds from their very different properties.
Carbon dioxide is a harmless gas that living things add to the atmosphere during respiration.
Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas that can quickly kill people if it becomes too concentrated in the air.
Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide have very different properties
Carbon Dioxide:
Every time you exhale, you release carbon dioxide into the air.
It's an odorless, colorless gas.
Carbon dioxide contributes to global climate change, but it isn't directly harmful to human health.
Carbon Monoxide:
Carbon monoxide is produced when matter burns.
It's a colorless, odorless gas that is very harmful to human health.
In fact, it can kill people in minutes.
Because you can't see or smell carbon monoxide, it must be detected with an alarm.
Types of Compounds
There are two basic types of compounds that differ in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms or ions together.
They are covalent and ionic compounds.
Both types are described below.
