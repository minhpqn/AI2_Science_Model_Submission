The pH of a solution is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen-ion concentration.
pH = -log[H + ]
In pure water or a neutral solution the [H + ] = 1.0 × 10 -7  M.
Substituting into the pH expression:
pH = -log[1.0 × 10 -7 ] = -(-7.00) = 7.00
The pH of pure water or any neutral solution is thus 7.00.
For recording purposes, the numbers to the right of the decimal point in the pH value are the significant figures.
Since 1.0 × 10 -7 has two significant figures, the pH can be reported as 7.00.
A logarithmic scale condenses the range of acidity to numbers that are easy to use.
Consider a solution with [H + ] = 1.0 × 10 -4  M.
That is a hydrogen-ion concentration that is 1000 times higher than the concentration in pure water.
The pH of such a solution is 4.00, a difference of just 3 pH units.
Notice that when the [H + ] is written in scientific notation and the coefficient is 1, the pH is simply the exponent with the sign changed.
The pH of a solution with the [H + ] = 1 × 10 -2  M is 2 and the pH of a solution with the [H + ] = 1 × 10 -10  M is 10.
As we saw earlier, a solution with the [H + ] higher than 1.0 × 10 -7 is acidic, while a solution with the [H + ] lower than 1.0 × 10 -7 is basic.
Consequently, solutions whose pH is less than 7 are acidic, while those with a pH higher than 7 are basic.
The Figure below illustrates this relationship, along with some examples of various solutions.
