(A) Cubes have six sides that are all the same size square.
All of the angles in a cube are equal to 90°. (B) Rhombohedra also have six sides, but the sides are diamond-shaped. (C) Octahedra have eight sides that are all shaped like triangles.
Fracture describes how a mineral breaks without any pattern.
A fracture is uneven.
The surface is not smooth and flat.
You can learn about a mineral from the way it fractures.
If a mineral splinters like wood, it may be fibrous.
Some minerals, such as quartz, fracture to form smooth, curved surfaces.
Pictured below is a mineral that broke forming a smooth, curved surface ( Figure below ).
This mineral formed a smooth, curved surface when it fractured

Other Identifying Characteristics
Minerals have other properties that can be used for identification.
For example, a mineral’s shape may indicate its crystal structure.
Sometimes crystals are too small to see.
Then a mineralogist may use a special instrument to find the crystal structure.
Some minerals have unique properties.
These can be used to the minerals.
Listed below are some of these properties ( Table below ); an example of a mineral that has each property is also listed.
