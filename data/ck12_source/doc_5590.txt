The volume of a regular object can be calculated by multiplying its length by its width by its height.
Since each of those is a linear measurement, we say that units of volume are derived from units of length.
The SI unit of volume is the cubic meter (m 3 ), which is the volume occupied by a cube that measures 1 m on each side.
This very large volume is not very convenient for typical use in a chemistry laboratory.
A liter (L) is the volume of a cube that measures 10 cm (1 dm) on each side.
A liter is thus equal to both 1000 cm 3 (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) and to 1 dm 3 .
A smaller unit of volume that is commonly used is the milliliter (mL – note the capital L which is a standard practice).
A milliliter is the volume of a cube that measures 1 cm on each side.
Therefore, a milliliter is equal to a cubic centimeter (cm 3 ).
There are 1000 mL in 1 L, which is the same as saying that there are 1000 cm 3 in 1 dm 3 .
Picture of a water bottle
A typical water bottle is 1 liter in volume
Picture of a Rubik's Cube
Rubik’s cube.
This Rubik’s cube is 5.7 cm on each side and has a volume of 185.2 cm 3 or 185.2 mL.
A graduated cylinder is used to measure volume
Graduated cylinder.
Volume in the laboratory is often measured with a graduated cylinder, which come in a variety of sizes.
Length is the measurement of the extent of something along its greatest dimension.
Volume is the amount of space occupied by a sample of matter.
