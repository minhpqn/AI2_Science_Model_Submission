Fathers always pass their X chromosome to their daughters and their Y chromosome to their sons.
Can you explain why fathers always determine the sex of the offspring?
Traits controlled by genes located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y) are called sex-linked traits ( Figure below ).
Remember, females have two X chromosomes and males have a X and a Y chromosome.
Therefore, any recessive allele on the X chromosome of a male will not be masked by a dominant allele.
X-linked traits include the hemophilia and color blindness.
Hemophilia is the name of a family of hereditary genetic illnesses that impair the body's ability to control coagulation.
Color Blindness, or color vision deficiency, in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all colors that other people can distinguish.
X-linked recessive inheritance.
As boys have only one X-chromosome, if they inherit the mutant allele from their mother, they will possess the phenotype that results from that allele.
As shown in this example for color blindness, mothers pass the recessive allele for the trait to their sons, who pass it to their daughters.
Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally.
Factors in blood are involved in clotting.
When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding.
When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding.
Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form.
Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family.
It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males.
F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein.
Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein.
