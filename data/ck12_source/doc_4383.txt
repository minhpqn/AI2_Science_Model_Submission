So what exactly is a dinosaur?
Dinosaurs were not lizards.
Rather, they were a separate group of reptiles with a distinct upright posture not found in lizards.
Dinosaurs can be described as large, powerful reptiles.
And many were very big.
But dinosaurs were more than that.
They were a varied group of animals with over 1,000 non-avian species.
Evolution of Reptiles
The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago.
They resembled small lizards, but they were not yet reptiles.
Their amniotic eggs allowed them to move away from bodies of water and become larger.
They soon became the most important land vertebrates.
Synapsids and Sauropsids
By about 320 million years ago, early amniotes had diverged into two groups, called synapsids and sauropsids.
Synapsids were amniotes that eventually gave rise to mammals.
Sauropsids were amniotes that evolved into reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds.
The two groups of amniotes differed in their skulls.
The earliest known reptile, pictured in Figure below , dates back about 315 million years.
