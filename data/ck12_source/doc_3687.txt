Look at (or feel) your own earlobes.
Which form of the trait do you have?
Can you tell which genotype you have?
Other single-gene autosomal traits include widow's peak and hitchhiker's thumb.
The dominant and recessive forms of these traits are shown in Figure below .
Which form of these traits do you have?
What are your possible genotypes for the traits?
Widow's peak and hitchhiker's thumb are dominant traits
Widow's peak and hitchhiker's thumb are dominant traits controlled by a single autosomal gene.
Traits controlled by genes on the sex chromosomes are called sex-linked traits , or X-linked traits in the case of the X chromosome.
Single-gene X-linked traits have a different pattern of inheritance than single-gene autosomal traits.
Do you know why?
Itâ€™s because males have just one X chromosome.
In addition, they always inherit their X chromosome from their mother, and they pass it on to all their daughters but none of their sons.
This is illustrated in Figure below .
Sex-linked traits and inheritance
Inheritance of Sex Chromosomes.
Mothers pass only X chromosomes to their children.
Fathers always pass their X chromosome to their daughters and their Y chromosome to their sons.
Can you explain why fathers always determine the sex of the offspring?
