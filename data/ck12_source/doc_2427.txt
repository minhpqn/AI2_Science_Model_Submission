Homogeneous or Heterogeneous?
The lemonade in the opening picture is an example of a homogeneous mixture.
A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout.
Another example of a homogeneous mixture is salt water.
If you analyzed samples of ocean water in different places, you would find that the proportion of salt in each sample is the same: 3.5 percent.
The rock in Figure above is an example of a heterogeneous mixture.
A heterogeneous mixture varies in its composition.
The black nuggets, for example, are not distributed evenly throughout the rock.
