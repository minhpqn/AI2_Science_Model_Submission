A:
Atoms also contain positively charged particles that cancel out the negative charge of the electrons.
However, these positive particles weren’t discovered until a couple of decades after Thomson discovered electrons.
The Plum Pudding Model
Thomson also knew that atoms are neutral in electric charge, so he asked the same question:
How can atoms contain negative particles and still be neutral?
He hypothesized that the rest of the atom must be positively charged in order to cancel out the negative charge of the electrons.
He envisioned the atom as being similar to a plum pudding, like the one pictured in the Figure below —mostly positive in charge (the pudding) with negative electrons (the plums) scattered through it.
Plum pudding and Thomson's plum pudding model
Q:
How is our modern understanding of atomic structure different from Thomson’s plum pudding model?
A:
Today we know that all of the positive charge in an atom is concentrated in a tiny central area called the nucleus, with the electrons swirling through empty space around it, as in the Figure below .
The nucleus was discovered just a few years after Thomson discovered the electron, so the plum pudding model was soon rejected.
Model of an atom
In 1897, J.
J.
Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the electron, while researching cathode rays.
To explain the neutrality of atoms, Thomson proposed a model of the atom in which negative electrons are scattered throughout a sphere of positive charge.
He called his atom the plum pudding model.
