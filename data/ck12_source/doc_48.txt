Describe the features and list examples of viruses.
What causes the common cold?
That miserable cough and runny nose is caused by one villain: a virus.
Viruses come in many different shapes, including the prickly balls you see here.
They are so tiny that they can only be seen with a very powerful microscope.
What is a Virus?
We have all heard of viruses.
The flu, the common cold, and many other diseases are caused by viruses.
But what is a virus?
Do you think viruses are living?
Which domain do they belong to?
Bacteria?
Archaea?
Eukarya?
Are Viruses Alive?
The answer is actually “no.” A virus is essentially DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat of protein ( Figure below ).
It is not made of a cell , and cannot maintain a stable internal environment ( homeostasis ).
Recall that a cell is the basic unit of living organisms.
So if a virus is not made of at least one cell, can it be living?
Viruses also cannot reproduce on their own—they need to infect a host cell to reproduce.
