A coefficient is a small whole number placed in front of a formula in an equation in order to balance it.
The 2 in front of the H 2 means that there are a total of  2 \times 2 = 4 atoms of hydrogen as reactants.
Visually, the reaction looks like the Figure below .
Carbon and hydrogen react to form methane
Reaction between carbon and hydrogen to form methane.
In the balanced equation, there is one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen on both sides of the arrow.
Below are guidelines for writing and balancing chemical equations.
Determine the correct chemical formulas for each reactant and product.
Write the skeleton equation.
Count the number of atoms of each element that appears as a reactant and as a product.
If a polyatomic ion is unchanged on both sides of the equation, count it as a unit.
Balance each element on at a time by placing coefficients in front of the formulas.
No coefficient is written for a 1.
It is best to begin by balancing elements that only appear in one formula on each side of the equation.
NEVER change the subscripts in a chemical formula â€“ you can only balance equations by using coefficients.
Check each atom or polyatomic ion to be sure that they are equal on both sides of the equation.
Make sure that all coefficients are in the lowest possible ratio.
If necessary, reduce to the lowest ratio.
