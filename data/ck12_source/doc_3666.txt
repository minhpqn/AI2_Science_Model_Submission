Based on the rules of probability, any given gamete of this parent has a 50 percent chance of having the B allele and a 50 percent chance of having the b allele.
Gametes are formed during meiosis
Formation of gametes by meiosis.
Paired alleles always separate and go to different gametes during meiosis.
Probability and Fertilization
Which of these gametes joins in fertilization with the gamete of another parent plant?
This is a matter of chance, like tossing a coin.
Thus, we can assume that either type of gamete—one with the B allele or one with the b allele—has an equal chance of uniting with any of the gametes produced by the other parent.
Now assume that the other parent is also Bb .
If gametes of two Bb parents unite, what is the chance of the offspring having one of each allele like the parents ( Bb )?
What is the chance of them having a different combination of alleles than the parents (either BB or bb )?
To answer these questions, geneticists use a simple tool called a Punnett square, which is the focus of the next concept.
Probability is the chance that a certain event will occur.
For example, the probability of a head turning up on any given coin toss is 50 percent.
Probability can be used to predict the chance of gametes and offspring having certain alleles.
