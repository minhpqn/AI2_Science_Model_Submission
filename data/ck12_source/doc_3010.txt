The inertia of an object depends on its mass.
Objects with greater mass also have greater inertia.
It would be easier for Lauren to push just one of her cousins on her skateboard than both of them.
With just one twin, there would be only about half as much mass on the skateboard, so there would be less inertia to overcome.
To change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an unbalanced force acting on the object.
The unbalanced force that starts Lauren’s cousins rolling along on the skateboard is applied by Lauren when she gives it a push.
Once an object starts moving, inertia keeps it moving without any additional force being applied.
In fact, it won’t stop moving unless another unbalanced force opposes its motion.
For example, Lauren can stop the rolling skateboard by moving to the other end and pushing in the opposite direction.
Q :
What if Lauren didn’t stop the skateboard in this way?
If it remained on a smooth, flat surface, would it just keep rolling forever?
A :
The inertia of the moving skateboard would keep it rolling forever if no other unbalanced force opposed its motion.
However, another unbalanced force does act on the skateboard
Q :
What other force is acting on the skateboard?
A :
The other force is rolling friction between the skateboard’s wheels and the ground.
The force of friction opposes the motion of the rolling skateboard and would eventually bring it to a stop without any help from Lauren.
