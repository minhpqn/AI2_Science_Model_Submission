Simple Harmonic Motion
The Big Idea
The development of devices to measure time, like the pendulum, led to the analysis of periodic motion .
Such motion repeats itself in equal intervals of time (called periods) and is also referred to as harmonic motion.
When an object moves back and forth over the same path in harmonic motion it is said to be oscillating.
If the distance such an object travels in one oscillation remains constant, it is called simple harmonic motion (SHM).
A grandfather clockâ€™s pendulum and the quartz crystal in a modern watch are examples of SHM.
Harmonic Period and Frequency
Describe the concepts of period and frequency.
Read the period and frequency off a graph and calculate them for systems in harmonic motion.
Students will learn the concepts of period and frequency and how to read them off a graph and how to calculate them for systems in harmonic motion.
In addition, students will learn how to graph simple harmonic motion.
\mathrm{Period~Equations} \begin{cases} T = \frac{1}{f} & \mathrm{Period~is~the~inverse~of~frequency}\\\ T_{\mathrm{spring}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} & \mathrm{Period~of~mass~} m \mathrm{~on~a~spring~with~constant~} k\\\ T_{\mathrm{pendulum}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} & \mathrm{Period~of~a~pendulum~of~length~} L \end{cases}
\mathrm{Kinematics~of~SHM} \begin{cases} x(t) = x_0 + A\cos{2\pi f(t-t_0)} & \mathrm{Position~of~an~object~in~SHM~of~Amplitude~}A\\\ v(t) = -2\pi f A\cos{2\pi f(t-t_0)} & \mathrm{Velocity~of~an~object~in~SHM~of~Amplitude~}A \end{cases}
A bee flaps its wings at a rate of approximately 190 Hz.
How long does it take for a bee to flap its wings once (down and up)?
Question:
T = ? [sec]
Given: f = 190 \ Hz
Equation:
