Q :
What force stretches the bungee cord after the jumper jumps?
When does the bungee cord snap back to its original shape?
A :
After the bungee jumper jumps, he accelerates toward the ground due to gravity.
His weight stretches the bungee cord.
As the bungee cord stretches, it exerts elastic force upward against the jumper, which slows his descent and brings him to a momentary stop.
Then the bungee cord springs back to its original shape, and the jumper bounces upward.
Using Elastic Force
Elastic force can be very useful and not just for bungee jumping.
In fact, you probably use elastic force every day.
A few common uses of elastic force are shown in the Figure below .
Do you use elastic force in any of these ways?
Examples of elastic objects
Q :
How does the resistance band work?
How does it use elastic force?
A :
When you pull on the band, it stretches but doesnâ€™t break.
The resistance you feel when you pull on it is elastic force.
