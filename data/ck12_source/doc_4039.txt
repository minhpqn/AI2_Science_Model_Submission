If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotic cells.
How did this happen?
The endosymbiotic theory provides the most widely-accepted explanation.
Thatâ€™s because it is well supported by evidence.
The First Eukaryotic Cells
According to the endosymbiotic theory, the first eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two or more prokaryotic cells.
Smaller prokaryotic cells were engulfed by (or invaded) larger prokaryotic cells.
The small cells (now called endosymbionts ) benefited from the relationship by getting a safe home and nutrients.
The large cells (now called hosts ) benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the endosymbionts.
Eventually, the endosymbionts evolved into organelles of the host cells.
After that, neither could live without the other.
As shown in Figure below , some of the endosymbionts were aerobic bacteria.
They were specialized to break down chemicals and release energy.
They evolved into the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.
Some of the small cells were cyanobacteria.
They were specialized for photosynthesis.
They evolved into the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells.
Endosymbiotic theory explains how eukaryotic cells arose.
Evidence for the Endosymbiotic Theory
Many pieces of evidence support the endosymbiotic theory.
