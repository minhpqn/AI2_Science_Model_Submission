She would use:
Electrical Energy = 1.2 kilowatts × 0.2 hour = 0.24 kilowatt-hours
You can learn much more about electrical energy use—including your own—at the URL below.
Use the tables and other information, along with the handy electrical energy calculator, to estimate how much electrical energy you use.
Electric power is the rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy.
The SI unit of power is the watt.
Electric power can be calculated as current times voltage.
Electrical energy use equals the power of the appliance multiplied by the amount of time the appliance is used.
