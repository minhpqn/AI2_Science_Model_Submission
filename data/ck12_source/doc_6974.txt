Consider the figure above with switch, S , initially open and the power supply set to 24 V:
What is the voltage drop across the 20 \Omega  resistor?
What current flows thru the 60 \Omega resistor?
What is the voltage drop across the 20 microfarad capacitor?
What is the charge on the capacitor?
How much energy is stored in that capacitor?
Find the capacitance of capacitors B , C , and D if compared to the 20 \mu \mathrm{F} capacitor where...
B has twice the plate area and half the plate separation
C has twice the plate area and the same plate separation
D has three times the plate area and half the plate separation
Now the switch in the previous problem is closed.
What is the total capacitance of branch with B and C?
What is the total capacitance of the circuit?
What is the voltage drop across capacitor B ?
