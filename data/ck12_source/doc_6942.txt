Show the proper connection of an ammeter and a voltmeter that could measure voltage across and current through the 2\ \Omega resistor.
What measurements would these instruments read?
Students are now measuring the terminal voltage of a battery hooked up to an external circuit.
They change the external circuit four times and develop the Table ( below ); using this data, complete the following:
Graph this data, with the voltage on the vertical axis.
Use the graph to determine the emf of the battery.
Use the graph to determine the internal resistance of the battery.
What voltage would the battery read if it were not hooked up to an external circuit?
Terminal Voltage (v)
You have a battery with an emf of 12\;\mathrm{V} and an internal resistance of 1.00\ \Omega .
Some 2.00\;\mathrm{A} are drawn from the external circuit.
What is the terminal voltage
The external circuit consists of device X , 0.5\;\mathrm{A} and 6\;\mathrm{V} ; device Y , 0.5\;\mathrm{A} and 10\;\mathrm{V} , and two different resistors.
Show how this circuit is connected.
Determine the values of the two resistors.
