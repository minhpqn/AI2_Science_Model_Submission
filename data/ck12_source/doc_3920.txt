Distinguish between dispersal and migration.
What would old luggage have to do with population growth?
Moving into an area, or immigration, is a key factor in the growth of populations.
Shown above is actual vintage luggage left by some of the millions of immigrants who came through Ellis Island and into the United States.
Populations gain individuals through births and immigration.
They lose individuals through deaths and emigration.
These factors together determine how fast a population grows.
Population Growth Rate
Population growth rate ( r ) is how fast a population changes in size over time.
A positive growth rate means a population is increasing.
A negative growth rate means it is decreasing.
The two main factors affecting population growth are the birth rate ( b ) and death rate ( d ).
Population growth may also be affected by people coming into the population from somewhere else ( immigration , i ) or leaving the population for another area ( emigration , e ).
The formula for population growth takes all these factors into account.
r = ( b + i ) - ( d + e )
r = population growth rate
b = birth rate
i = immigration rate
d = death rate
e = emigration rate
