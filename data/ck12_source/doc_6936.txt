Well the second path is ten times the resistance of the first, so it will have one tenth of the total current.
Thus, there is approximately and 0.069 Amps going through the 90\Omega and 10\Omega path and 0.621Amps going through the 10\Omega path.
P_{10 \Omega} &= I^2_{10\Omega}R_{10 \Omega}=(0.621A)^2(10\Omega)=3.8W\\P_{90+10\Omega} &= I^2_{90+10\Omega}R_{90 + 10 \Omega}=(0.069A)^2(100\Omega)=0.5W
We now know that the 20\Omega is the brightest, 10\Omega is second and then the 90\Omega and last the 10\Omega (-these last two have same current flowing through them, so 90\Omega is brighter due to its higher resistance).
^* Note:
Adding up these two plus the 9.5W from the 20\Omega resistor gives us 13.8W, which is the total power previously calculated, so we have confidence everything is good.
