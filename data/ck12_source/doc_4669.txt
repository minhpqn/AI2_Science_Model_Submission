The human body.
Made of numerous organ systems.
Maybe one of the most complex structures ever.
But all these systems and structures come together in an exquisite manner to make a fascinating organism.
Currently, the end of the line of evolution.
The most intelligent of all organisms.
An organism that can protect itself from pathogens, has bones for support, muscles to help it move, systems that allow it to respond to the environment, systems to bring oxygen into and around the body, systems to extract nutrients from food and get rid of wastes, and systems to make the next generation.
And all these systems and organs and tissues and cells work together to form one complete organism.
