The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things, from sipping through a straw to simply breathing.
You can see in the Figures below and below how we use air pressure in both of these ways.
Air pressure allows us to drink from straws
When you first suck on a straw, you remove air from the straw, so the air pressure in the straw is lower that the air pressure on the surface of the drink.
A fluid always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure, so the drink moves up the straw and into your mouth.
Air pressure allows us to breath
Q :
Can you think of other ways that air pressure is useful?

The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greatest at Earthâ€™s surface and falls as altitude increases.
The reason is that density and depth of the atmosphere are greatest at sea level and decline with increasing altitude.
The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things, from sipping through a straw to breathing.
Select any five U.S. cities and at the first URL below, find their elevations (in meters) above sea level.
If more than one elevation is given for a city, choose just one.
At the second URL below, find the atmospheric pressure (in kPa) at those elevations (altitudes).
Then make a graph of the atmospheric pressures of the five cities.
Use the type of graph that best shows how the cities differ in atmospheric pressure.
Be sure to label both axes of your graph.
