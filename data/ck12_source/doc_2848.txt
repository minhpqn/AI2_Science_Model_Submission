In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.
The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels.
On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.
The main concern over the use of nuclear energy is the risk of radiation.
Accidents at nuclear power plants can release harmful radiation that endangers people and other living things.
Even without accidents, the used fuel that is left after nuclear fission reactions is still radioactive and very dangerous.
It takes thousands of years for it to decay until it no longer releases harmful radiation.
Therefore, used fuel must be stored securely to protect people and other living things.

Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei.
This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter.
It begins when the nucleus of a radioactive atom gains a neutron.
In uncontrolled nuclear fission, one fission reaction starts a chain reaction, in which neutrons produced in one reaction cause other reactions, which cause more reactions, and so on.
Energy released by nuclear fission is used to produce electrical energy in nuclear power plants.
Production of nuclear energy doesn’t produce air pollution but it poses the risk of accidents that release harmful radiation.

How was nuclear fission discovered?
Describe in detail what happens to a uranium-235 nucleus when it is struck by a neutron, and explain why the nucleus splits in two.
